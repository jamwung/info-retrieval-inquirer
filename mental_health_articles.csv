Kris Bernal returns to exercising for her mental health,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/432348/kris-bernal-returns-to-exercising-for-her-mental-health/,"07:04 PM November 10, 2022","After some months of not physically sweating through some exercises, actress Kris Bernal has returned to the gym to keep herself more fit. Bernal showed some of her physical exercise regimen in a video she posted on Instagram today, November 8, showing off her doing some push ups, running, and lifting. “Just a few of the exercises I completed in 7 rounds with Coach @iamalvinescandor. You may have noticed that I don’t share as many photos or workout videos as I used to. While the amount of time I spend exercising has decreased, I still make an effort to fit it in once or twice a week,” she said in her post.   A post shared by Kris Bernal (@krisbernal)  More than improving her physical looks, Bernal says she wants to be more fit and healthy, her driving force to get back to the gym. “I might not be as lean and muscular as I once was, but now my main priority is staying healthy rather than worrying about how I should look,” she said. All that she’s after is for having a healthy wholistic approach to her being physical fit in all form possible. “My goal is as simple as just to be physically active because it can enhance mental health, assist in weight management, lower the risk of disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and enhance daily functioning,” she explained.

At I am M.A.D., we hope to address mental health issues in an empathetic way, with a unifying voice, helping everyone feel hopeful by empowering them to take action and create lasting change through our MAD Talks Padayon event,” said Christian Marx Rivero, co-founder and chairman of I am M.A.D. Rivero, who is also a recognized United Nations Youth Leader and is one of the speakers, added that the theme “Sa Ngayon, Padayon” reminds everyone to push through their journey in life and continue believing that they can do something meaningful even in the face of uncertainty.

"Healthy Mind Solutions, the future of mental health, now in the Philippines",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/413348/healthy-mind-solutions-the-future-of-mental-health-now-in-the-philippines/,"04:32 PM August 24, 2022","MANILA, Philippines – There has been an increased focus on mental health during the pandemic; however, many of those who feel anxious and depressed may not have the mental health solutions within their reach. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 6M Filipinos are suffering from depression and anxiety. WHO also estimates that mental health conditions in the Philippines is costing the country P68.9B, which includes loss of workforce and reduced productivity. The top three barriers for Filipinos seeking mental health support are the fear of social stigma attached to mental illness, the inaccessibility of services and financial constraints of availing the services. The Philippines ranks 3rd among countries with the highest rates of mental disorders in the Western Pacific Region. Mental illness is a much larger kind of pandemic that, if unaddressed, can severely affect millions of Filipinos. Furthermore, according to the July 4, 2022 Inquirer.net article, analytics firm, Gallup, in its “State of the Global Workplace: 2022 Report,” says that while workers everywhere said life at work is “not well,” those in the Philippines are among the most stressed out in the world. 68,000 workers in over 140 countries and half of 1,000 Filipinos 15 years and older were surveyed for the report and said “yes” when asked whether they experienced stress most of the day. At 50 percent, worker stress in the Philippines was the highest in Southeast Asia in 2021. While it was three points lower than 53 percent in 2020, it was still higher than the global average.”  Filipino culture has attached a social stigma on mental illnesses and consider it as a reflection on the person’s character, prompting most to suffer in silence and not seek help, even from their own families. Accessibility to mental health help is also limited and unaffordable to many. Canadian wellness company Healthy Mind Solutions (HMS) seeks to break this stigma by providing companies with mental health solutions and services that are effective, confidential, convenient, research-based and affordable. Their mental health platform MindWoRX is revolutionary, game-changing and is considered the future of mental health in the Philippines. Introducing HMS’ MindWorRx – An important tool for HR practitioners HMS is launching MindWoRx in the Philippines.

HR practitioners are looking for a preventative and innovative solution that will not only help manage the mental health issues of their employees but also provide them with tools that will help them to become more mentally resilient. “HMS has the solution, “says Richard Caballero, HMS Founder and CEO. “One company that acknowledges the importance of mental fitness is Medicareplus, one of the leading HMOs in the country.

Kim Atienza supports daughter’s mental health journey,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/411250/kim-atienza-supports-daughters-mental-health-journey/,"07:43 PM July 26, 2022","Like any dutiful father would, weather man Kim Atienza expressed his support for his daughter’s mental health journey by showing what she has shared about the subject, including her own personal experiences. Atienza shared his youngest daughter Emmanuelle’s drawing and diary excerpt about weight loss through his Instagram page last Sunday, July 24 “I posted a video on my tiktok showing my ‘weight loss journey’ thinking nothing of it until people started asking me ‘how did you lose weight?'” Emmanuelle said in her diary. Atienza’s daughter admitted that “after properly dieting and losing an increasingly high amount of weight,” she became “obsessive” over her calories. “I would sometimes eat much less than a healthy body needs to survive. It became so obsessive that others became concerned about my own health and my daily functioning was at stake,” she said. Emmanuelle revealed that she was refused professional help because she was not “clinically underweight” at the time. “This is yet another way the stereotypes associated with mental health can truly affect people. I was struggling with my body, caloric intake, and more. Yet, because I wasn’t underweight i couldn’t get help. this caused my mentality to deteriorate further,” she pointed out.    A post shared by Kuya Kim (@kuyakim_atienza)  She stressed that since anorexia nervosa is defined as “an emotional disorder characterized by an obsessive desire to lose weight by refusing to eat,” it does not “specify “underweight.” “Yet I was only given professional help once I was clinically underweight,” she revealed. With that, she urged netizens to “lose weight healthily,” to research well before starting on a diet, and to remember one’s limits. “If you are already struggling, I encourage you to seek help even if you aren’t underweight. Remember that anorexia or any eating disorder isn’t defined by your weight, it’s your mental state and daily habits in which symptoms are present,” she explained. For her, the numbers on the weighing scale do not measure one’s self worth. She affirmed her beauty both before and after her weight loss.

Mental health and art meet at this Filipina-led exhibit in UC Davis,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/404790/mental-health-and-art-meet-at-this-filipina-led-exhibit-in-uc-davis/,"01:35 PM June 17, 2022","To the unconventional thinkers and feelers. To those lost but found in art’s embrace. The intersection of art and mental health is nothing unfamiliar to us. People view painting as a stress reliever and writing as an instrument to convey one’s thoughts. Art contributes to our mental health, and vice versa. For many, including myself, creative expression is a security blanket. But not knowing how or failing to understand the gravity of their relationship, is sort of like not knowing how your best friend likes their coffee, coffee that gets them through their hectic days. As Harper Lee put it, how else would we grasp all of this if not through climbing into someone else’s skin and walking around in it? Two friends who share a similar spirit and drive to promote diverse personal artistry have come together to do just that. Macy Lee and Jiji Patricio, University of California (UC), Davis students, are holding their first multisensory art exhibit until today, June 4, at their university. Patricio, 21, is a visual artist, disc jockey, programming director for KDVS 90.3 FM, and scholar-activist who’s pursuing BA degrees in Anthropology and Asian American Studies. Lee, 20, is a speaker, writer and photographer for mental health, social justice and education. She started the Philippine-based mental health nonprofit Talang Dalisay along with My State of Mind, its global branch, which is active in different parts of the world. She is studying Psychology and International Relations. As they navigate through their own ruminations about identity and meaning, their wish is to empathize with their audiences through art they have curated from a mix of students and award-winning artists. The exhibit, called “Worlds Through Minds,” does not fall short on enlightening us with wisdom by viewing lives through another’s lens. Being an online and in-person exhibit with various forms of art from across the globe, the topic of mental health is distinctively tackled by artists’ art, photography and poetry. Representing the Philippines are artists Felezedad Caridad, Wipo Wipo, Colin Dancel, Mariano Batocabe, Natasha Mañosa-Tanjutco, Aia Solis, Pau Villanueva and Gab Mejia. Cofounders and cocurators Lee and Patricio gave us a glimpse on how it all came to be. Walk us through your thought process in deciding to curate these pieces and in linking the advocacy of mental health to your exhibit. Lee: Many people, experiences and artists inspired me to push through with this exhibit. But one person really ignited the spark in me and one day after seeing them, I just started shooting out so many ideas and contacted people I’ve admired for the longest time to ask them to work with me. I started this idea and slowly asked people about it in January, until my friend and cocurator Jiji reached out to me with a surprisingly similar idea. It was fate and truly meant to be. I reached out to artists from home in Manila, to my home here in California, and other people from around the world whose art spoke to me deeply. I think that the artists I invited come from such unique and diverse backgrounds that reflect their own personal, genuine stories which is the only thing that really mattered to me. What cathartic emotions can the viewers expect to feel as they walk through the exhibit, virtually or in-person? Patricio: I think viewers should expect to feel generally overwhelmed while walking through our exhibit. These art pieces evoke a range of emotions, from discomfort, to sadness, to joy, to confusion, to everything and anything else you can possibly think of. Art is powerful in this way, and I think because we have so many dynamic artists in the space (over 20), people are bound to experience a wave of emotions as they look and walk through the Basement Gallery. My hope is that viewers will critically engage with these feelings as they arise and pass and ultimately examine the deeper realities that such emotions speak to. This exhibit must mean a lot to you both. How do you feel about your brainchild? Lee: I really just want to share and highlight the power and importance of language through art. This is a universal, open medium people oftentimes overlook and take for granted. However, this exhibit is a reminder that this should be celebrated, as it binds people together and connects the inner and outer lives of people from all over the world. We live in a beautiful, loving universe amid all its bigotry, and it’s pertinent to remind ourselves and each other of that truth! Patricio: I am super grateful that I got the opportunity to cocurate a project like “Worlds Through Minds” while at UC Davis. As a nonart student here who loves art, it was always hard for me to balance my creative interests with my workload due to limited time and capacity. But this small idea eventually became a passion project that is finally coming to fruition—right before I graduate, too—and I couldn’t be happier! —CONTRIBUTED INQ Follow @worldsthroughminds on Instagram; visit worldsthroughminds.com.

What we did to make mental health care more accessible for students,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/400470/what-we-did-to-make-mental-health-care-more-accessible-for-students/,"08:10 PM April 11, 2022","Trigger warning: This article discusses topics surrounding depression, suicide and other mental health illnesses. Recent data from the National Statistics Office showed that mental illnesses are ranked as the third most common form of morbidity among Filipinos. In 2021, the Department of Health estimated that at least 3.6 million Filipinos faced mental health issues in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Children and adolescents are among the most vulnerable of them all. The World Health Organization estimates that 10 to 15 percent of Filipinos aged 5 to 15 years old are affected by mental health problems, and 16 percent of Filipino students age 13 to 17 years old has attempted suicide at least once within the span of a year. With this in mind, what can we do in order to become better advocates of mental health, particularly in our educational institutions? Cultivating a society that is open to discussions about mental health is already a step in the right direction. But we must also kick it up a notch, especially because there is still a significant number of people who see mental health, especially mental illnesses, as a taboo topic. In the Philippines, discrimination against people with mental illnesses is quite common. This stigma highlighted the fact that many Filipinos lack proper information and education regarding mental health issues and mental health literacy. School is our second home and I believe that it is important that we integrate mental health care and awareness into our educational system. I’ve been a student leader for my university’s student council for almost four years now and in early 2021, in light of the burnout, stress and other struggles because of the new online learning set-up, I thought, “What can we do to in order to make mental health care more accessible to our school community?” With that came the idea of establishing a university-wide mental health coalition. The goal of the project was to require each of the college student councils in our university to have a mental health committee, which would later on be a part of the centralized mental health coalition. As a collective whole, the members of the coalition would then undergo a series of trainings, in order for them to gain more knowledge and information on the different topics surrounding mental health awareness, which they can later on apply when they begin conducting initiatives and projects for their respective colleges, in collaboration with their guidance counselors. The project also aims to conduct a monthly/bimonthly wellness survey (formulated with the help of guidance counselors and other mental health professionals) which would help the university administrators to have an overview of the mental wellness status of the students in the university. Depending on the results of the survey, the administrators may impose academic breaks (even during in-person setup), adjust the schedule of examinations or call upon the professors to lighten the workload of the students. With the help of my costudent leaders under the advocacies committee, Enrick Orajay (first year, BS Psychology) and my coproject head Sabrina Periabras (third year, BS Psychology), this project finally came to life. “Katuwang: The Thomasian Mental Health Coalition” had its first training session/webinar in March via Zoom and Facebook Live. We aim for this project to continue, in order to cultivate a more mental health-friendly environment for our student body, professors, administrators, nonteaching and religious personnel. Let me share with you my notes (bit.ly/KatuwangNotes), in case you want to adapt them and implement a version of them in your own school. You may substitute the proponents of the project—for example, if you don’t have a student council per college, you may choose your class officers instead. The Mental Health Act, also known as Republic Act 11036, was officially signed into a law in June 2018. One of the provisions of the law states that “Educational institutions . . . shall develop policies and programs for students, educators and other employees designed to raise awareness on mental health issues, identify and provide support and services for individuals at risk, and facility access, including referral mechanisms of individual with metal health conditions to treatment and psychosocial support.” While a lot of schools already have programs that cater to the mental health of their community such as free counseling sessions and other psychological services, having an established policy will aid in making these programs permanent, as well as establish a set of standard operating procedures. In the study titled “A Genre Analysis of School Mental Health Policy Documents,” Dr. Sterling Plata of De La Salle University analyzed various school mental health policies from different educational institutions in the United Kingdom. Based on the policy documents that were analyzed, the following are considered as mandatory contents: 1. Policy statement: Includes the school’s vision in relation to mental health and well-being. 2. Policy aims: Reiterates the goals related to the promotion of mental health awareness, as well as identification and prevention of mental health illnesses. 3. Key staff members: Includes the names of the people who will be in charge of upholding the policy and their responsibilities in regards to the mental health of the academic community. 4. Signposting: Refers to the means of communication of the educational institution with the students and parents about the said policy. 5. Warning signs: Includes a detailed description that will serve as a guide for teachers, staff members and parents, in recognizing potential mental health problems. 6. Managing disclosures: Refers to handling disclosure and confidentiality. 7. Confidentiality: Provides details about what particular confidential information can be shared, to whom, why it must be shared and how. This clause also addresses concerns about respecting a students’ decision to not inform their parents about their respective mental health problems. 8. Working with parents: Includes guidelines on how to respond to parents who disclose/report the mental health problems of their children. 9. Support peers: States how friends of students who are suffering from mental health problems can provide support for their peers. This clause also includes how much information can be shared with the students. 10. Training: How and when students, teachers and personnel will be trained on topics about mental health awareness. 11. Policy review: May include the dates and process of when the policy must be reviewed and updated. 12. Appendices: Some of the analyzed policies in the study provided a description of different mental illnesses, its symptoms and where to seek additional information and support. With all of the hardships that that we faced during the pandemic, and the readjustment that we would have to undergo after it’s finally over, we are in need of initiatives that cater to the cultivation of a healthier and improved mental health environment in our educational institution. We have been advocating for mental health awareness in schools for so long, and I believe that it’s time for us to take it one step further. Aside from the webinars and social media movements, we must establish projects, initiatives and policies that are more sustainable for years to come. Mental health is a vital part of the development of each person, whether they be a teacher, a staff or a student, and must always be given priority and treated with utmost importance, especially in the place that we refer to as our “second home.” —CONTRIBUTED INQ The author is a Bachelor of Arts in Behavioral Science student at University of Santo Tomas.

Tending to your mental health is all about recognizing your unique needs and developing practices and habits to honor them.

She thus spoke about ways to boost one’s mental capacity and shared it with fans. First, she suggested a change of scenery or environment. “A change of scene or a change of pace is good for your mental health. It could be a five-minute pause from work or from cleaning your house, a half-hour lunch break at work or a weekend exploring somewhere new,” she said in her Instagram page yesterday, Jan. 23, where she can be seen on a beach with her dog. Second, she advised for people to have “me time” which is time alone with one’s self, because “a few minutes can be enough to de-stress you.” Third, she believes in taking a break through exercise and making one’s self fit. “Taking a break may mean being very active — in sports, walking, running, swimming or just about doing any workout or it may also mean not doing very much at all,” she said.

Try yoga or meditation, or just putting your feet up — you can do this wherever you are.” Lastly, Fullido suggests to “listen to your body” and have enough time to sleep. “If you’re really tired, give yourself time to sleep. Without good sleep, our mental health suffers too and our concentration goes downhill,” she said. “You deserve to REST.

It is a qualitative antigen rapid immuno-assay and visual read test done through nasal swab, and is just an easy three-step process: swab, drop, wait. Check out lab2test.com. Within 15 minutes, I knew the unwanted outcome! The dreaded two-line result meant I had the virus and had to instantly isolate and quarantine in my room for the next 10 days. Luckily, I was already isolating so my daughter, Athena Valdes, and all at home were far from me. Thankfully, they tested negative. There was a period of panic after testing positive—not just for my own health, but for the health of others I may have been around recently. I alerted all who came in close contact with me prior to my fever (at least two days prior to symptom onset or testing positive). Close contact is defined as being within 6 feet of someone for a combined total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period while contagious. Bottom-line: It’s incredibly important to let people know that they have been exposed. So within a few days, I have become an expert in home recovery and self-discovery while in isolation due to COVID. For starters, it’s best to eat and sleep in your own space, away from others, as well as use your own bathroom. If you do need to be in a shared living space, wear a mask; avoid contact with others, including pets; and do not share items, such as towels, blankets and cups. To supplement the medicines your doctor prescribes, I recommend Usana Poly C Vitamins and other Usana essentials to keep your immune system strong. Keep hydrating with water and take Hydrite, oral rehydration salts, twice a day. My Red Charity Gala partner Kaye Tinga made sure her daughter ate, even with no appetite, to recover faster. Aside from the basic steps like getting enough sleep, keeping hydrated and loading up on vitamins, my sister-in-law Ria Prieto told me she cleaned up her Instagram feed to make sure it’s inspiring and positive. She “unfollowed” those who post bad vibes to protect her mental health. For the most part of 2021, I was thrust into a world of the unknown. For months, I was emotionally distraught, enduring mood swings throughout a given day. Not only were my past and future uncertain, but I also doubted my present relationship. Like Ria, I need to do a mental health check! During this isolation, I used most of my time to dive into self-help books that were recommended by Xandra Ramos of National Book Store. When people fall out of touch, it is quite common that we outgrow them. If there is no forward progress, the mindset needs to declare and make a choice. Journaling is another activity to keep us busy while in home quarantine. It helps with finding that new direction and choice. This pandemic has made me miss out on a lot of events. One of them was the recently concluded affair Fundacion Sanso X Septième Rebelle, a fashion and art exhibit. Fine art has, unsurprisingly, inspired the creation not only of museum-worthy couture, but also wearable yet stylish and impeccably constructed designer pieces. Such is the case with Manila-based couture label Septième Rebelle whose collection, “Awakening,” is inspired by the work of no less than distinguished Spanish-born painter Juvenal Sansó. Unbeknown to many, Sansó dabbled in fashion as a textile designer while he was a student at the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris in the 1960s, as a means of supporting himself when the Central Bank had set caps on the financial support that could be sent by his father from Manila. Sansó’s hand-painted textile designs depicted florals and foliage, as well as geometric shapes and abstract patterns. The House of Balenciaga was his biggest client. Robbe Santos, owner and creative force behind Septième Rebelle, is no stranger to Sansó’s work as a patron of the arts himself. But Sansó’s story of working as a young textile designer in Paris may have added another dimension to Santos’ appreciation of the renowned painter, prompting a vision beyond his—that of an art connoisseur. Santos draws a connection between his experience as a fashion designer inspired by fine art, and Sansó’s experience dabbling in fashion many years ago. Santos chose to name his collection “Awakening” as a nod—or rather, a curtsy—to the revival of fashion after World War II, which was the time a young Sansó made contributions to fashion as a designer for fabric houses and ateliers overseas; and to the hopeful resurgence of high fashion after limitations set by debilitating lockdowns. More than a showcase of wearable art, the collection is also part of fundraising efforts in partnership with Fundacion Sansó. Wishing you all safer days ahead!  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
‘Thank you for being brave’: Readers respond to mental health stories,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/392320/thank-you-for-being-brave-readers-respond-to-mental-health-stories/,"12:30 PM December 10, 2021","Long before it became a buzzword, the Philippine Daily Inquirer was already publishing stories about mental health. For years, the paper has come out with columns and features on the subject, with the intention of educating our readers about its importance. We’ve published essays, too, from both staff and contributors who write candidly about their own struggles with depression and anxiety. These personal pieces resonate with readers as evidenced by the amount of feedback we get from them. I first wrote about my mental health journey for the paper in April 2016, four months after I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety disorder. The very day the story “Turning the bad into good—how I used depression as my personal trainer” came out, I received so many messages from readers through Facebook, email and Instagram. “My friend read your article about your struggle against depression and anxiety disorder. She cried after reading it because she could relate with what you’re going through.” “I just read your article. Keep fighting . . . I’m a husband and father and I don’t know why or where I got it. Every day is a struggle for me.” “Like you, I also battled depression . . . ” “I want you to know that you are brave for putting it out there . . . I’m still wary who I tell about my diagnosis.” “I read your article in today’s paper . . . My daughter is suffering from depression.”  “Thank you so much for sharing your story. You are so brave to be able to share it to the public . . . ” “Help, my daughters say they are depressed.” “Your article about depression really resonated with me. It will shock the people close to me if they knew I was depressed. I don’t know where to start or whom to consult. What’s the first thing to do?” “Can you please share your doctor’s details? I would like to have myself checked. Been struggling for a few months and maybe it’s time to talk to an expert.” “My son is having issues with anxiety, can you please recommend a doctor he can see?” “I’ve also been looking for a competent psychiatrist and psychologist for some time now.” “I wish my daughter will have the same experience as you with your doctor.” Since then, I’ve written other stories about mental health (“Sadly, there is no Tinder for shrinks,” “Don’t go off your meds—trust me, I learned the hard way,” “15 lessons living with depression has taught me” and others), and I am just one of the bylines in the newspaper that have devoted space and effort to raising awareness about mental health. There’s Cathy Babao, whose columns focused on navigating grief. There’s Alya Honasan, whose beautifully written essays always enlighten. In one, she wrote, “Clinical depression is a serious, legitimate illness; it’s not a character flaw, a sign of weakness or a personality defect. Yes, it is a mental illness, but it doesn’t mean that a depressive person is permanently incapacitated, untrustworthy or out of his or her mind.” Even our student correspondents are devoted to spreading awareness about mental health and self-care, like Natalia Olfindo, who wrote in a recent article, “If you twisted your ankle, wouldn’t you seek a doctor for help? Why wouldn’t you do the same for your mental health?” We also come out with features on alternative ways people are trying to take care of their mental health—we’ve come out with stories on holistic medicine, sound healing, yoga, even the way one’s diet affects one’s mental health. And then during the pandemic, at a time when mental health concerns were at an all-time high, we went a step further. Inquirer partnered with Globe Telecom and, with our hardworking sales and marketing teams, we held a series of webinars about mental health, each one dedicated to a different demographic. The panels featured the powerful voices of experts and mental health advocates like Dr. Anna Cristina Tuazon, Dr. Carolina Uno-Rayco, Dr. Angela Cuadro, Dr. Gia Sison, Sen. Risa Hontiveros, Ronald Recio, Iza Calzado, Ari Verzosa, Jeannie Goulbourn and Kiana Valenciano. The #StartaNewDay sessions were more than just a webinar—they were a way of providing safe spaces where people could talk about mental health with no fear of judgment. During the streams, audience members asked the experts questions and opened up about their own experiences. We promote mental health organizations, projects and events that we think would be beneficial to our readers as well. Some months ago, we did a feature on Milagros Rollinas, who was among the first batch of responders for Hopeline, the country’s first 24/7 suicide prevention hotline. Hopeline is run by NGF Mindstrong, the foundation put up by fashion designer Jeannie Goulbourn after losing her beloved daughter Natasha to suicide in 2002. Rollinas, now Hopeline’s program head, shared with us some of her unforgettable calls. She also told us how, during the pandemic, Hopeline observed a 300-percent increase in calls, with callers between the ages of 10 and 95. They get calls from people who lost their jobs, who are struggling with blended learning, who are having difficulty with adjusting to being confined at home. This was why, Rollinas said, Hopeline needed to raise funds—they need to add more responders to take the deluge of calls. The story “Tales from a suicide hotline responder” got a lot of attention. And, we were happy to hear from Rollinas that many people donated after reading it. This is the kind of impact we hope to make with our stories—we hope for our words to leap out of the pages and lead to real-life change. Our dedication to doing what we can to help our readers stay healthy in every way continues. We have exciting things planned for next year. We may be 36 years old, but we’re just getting started.

Mental health and the power of asking for help,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391007/mental-health-and-the-power-of-asking-for-help/,"05:55 PM November 09, 2021","If you twisted your ankle, wouldn’t you seek a doctor for help? Why wouldn’t you do the same for your mental health? “If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask!” the teachers announced. Growing up, I never saw the act of asking for help as a sign of weakness. It was always encouraged in my surroundings—whether that be in school or at home. If you were struggling with a Math question, you would turn to your teacher for help. If you couldn’t find an item at the grocery, you would ask the store’s staff for directions. It was only until I saw the stigma around therapy that this idea began to warp. I noticed how people gawked with judgment at others if they revealed they had a therapist. “She must be crazy,” they would say. Looks of disapproval and deep concern would pass over their faces. Yet, if you twisted your ankle, wouldn’t you seek a doctor for help? Why wouldn’t you do the same for your mental health? Late August through September was when my anxiety intensified and stuck around longer than usual. It was unexpected for me and especially my family. It felt as though there was a constant speech going on in my head, listing all the possible things I could hyperfixate on, and it’s a voice that only decides to shut up when I’m heading off to sleep. I pushed away my books, favorite songs and even my creative expression. I felt guilty. I live in a beautiful home in the city, I’m incredibly close to my family, I have valued friendships, good grades and even a side job I love doing while balancing school. I felt sheepish for feeling anxious when I’m surrounded by blessings. I thought there was something wrong with me. On top of this, I’m a people pleaser. I don’t enjoy feeling as though I’m causing people to worry; I thrive on meeting the standards for myself that I constructed in my mind. Ironic, since my parents were never the type to expect perfection. Yet, I was still stumbling. I opened up to my parents about my mental state and have continued to give them updates. We began searching for a therapist, asking loved ones for doctor recommendations and such. At the same time, I began taking a mental health course. It slowly occurred to me how many people were going through similar struggles regarding mental health. These were the same people I would pass in the school hallways or greet at family gatherings, yet, barely anyone seemed to speak about the importance of caring for our own mental well-being. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “Mental health includes our emotional, psychological and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel and act.” If what makes us human are our thoughts, feelings and actions, then why are we so silent? These elements that make us who we are, these elements that are our loudest qualities—and these are the same qualities we lack care for. Why do we constantly shine the spotlight on physicality and never on mentality? Our minds are who we are—shouldn’t we be checking in on its health more? Consequently, I began posting. I used social media to share short messages relating to mental health. Nothing groundbreaking, just simple reminders. I posted some insights on my mental state and shared informative posts regarding mental health as well. Social media has always acted as a highlight reel of someone’s life, which is why I expected that people wouldn’t associate struggle with my Instagram photos of snow on mountains or sunsets by the ocean. I noticed how sharing this small aspect of my reality was a way of coping, since I knew I was helping others as well. Instantly, messages began rolling in. People were thanking me for normalizing being vocal about my mental health, even though I was sharing only 10 percent of what I was going through. No matter the specificity of the situation you’re in, the feeling you have in your chest is universal. Everybody has experienced overthinking at some point. Everybody has experienced anxiety one way or another. Why haven’t we been addressing mental health more? We are far from where we should be in terms of speaking up about mental health. However, I cannot dismiss the amount of progress we’ve made over the years in normalizing this discussion. According to Mental Health UK, people with mental health problems in the 1950s were viewed as “lunatics,” whereas discussions on mental well-being in more recent times have been far more open and accepting. Over the phone, I told my 69-year-old grandmother about my first session with the therapist. “It’s such a relief that mental issues are discussed and addressed openly now—a far cry from our times when therapy was sort of stigmatized,” Lola Trina said. I am aware therapy may not be as accessible to some due to several circumstances. If this is your case, I highly suggest The Science of Well-Being course on Coursera. It’s a free online Yale course by Dr. Laurie Santos that discusses happiness and common false perceptions on matters we assume will make us happy (which do not) versus matters which actually bring us joy. Santos covers grounds relating to ways we can switch our mindset for the better through not only insightful and scientifically proven lectures but weekly assignments such as starting a gratitude journal and writing a letter to someone you love. The course also recommends outside sources such as books, essays and speeches found online. This course has not only helped me greatly but has had a positive impact on important people in my personal life, too. Though easier said than done, finding a person you are comfortable to open up to, whether that be a peer, parent or guardian will help greatly. In addition to that, I picked up journaling again and am continuing to ground myself through creative expression, which is a form of self-care that I remind myself to be thankful for daily. If you are struggling, searching for help and feel as though you have to go through this silently, please remind yourself that you don’t, and you are not alone. Do not compare yourself to someone else’s highlight reel—no matter how their life looks, they have problems of their own, too. It all boils down to us being human. Asking for help is not weak. Going to therapy does not make you weak. In fact, bringing those walls down and seeking insight from another person takes strength. Allowing yourself to be vulnerable and being open to guidance shows that you want to take steps to become a better person. While asking for assistance in math class improves your math skills, seeking guidance for your mental health will improve your mindset. To whoever is reading, whether you are going through something or not, check up on the people you love. Remind them that you love them. Be kinder today. It’ll boost your own happiness and theirs more than you think. —CONTRIBUTED INQ Hopeline, tel. 2919, 0917-5584673, 0918-8734673, 88044673  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
5 films on mental health that won’t make you feel hopeless,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/390024/5-films-on-mental-health-that-wont-make-you-feel-hopeless/,"12:56 PM October 21, 2021","Content warning: This article discusses mental health and related issues such as suicide. Sick and tired of hopeless cinema but looking for films that still tackle mental health? We’ve got a list for you. For National Mental Health Awareness Week, we’ve compiled these rom-coms and dramedies that will help remind you that mental health issues aren’t something to be ashamed of but they also don’t excuse us from being accountable for our actions. It’s important to remember that while there may be bad days, there are also good days.  “Short Term 12” follows the story of Grace (Brie Larson) who is a staff member at a foster care facility for at-risk teenagers. We soon learn that under the cool facade she maintains at work, she faces a traumatic past of her own. On top of the upcoming departure of quick-tempered but intelligent Marcus (LaKeith Stanfield) and the arrival of closed off but clever newcomer Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) to the facility, she deals with telling her boyfriend (John Gallagher Jr.) that she’s pregnant. Stephanie Beatriz and Rami Malek also play staff members in this truthful but thoughtful depiction of group homes. It doesn’t sugarcoat but it doesn’t feel like a pity party either. It’s nice how it shows the simple ways people try to find humor and happiness during rough times. Click here for a list of trigger warnings.  South Korean rom-com “Castaway on the Moon” is about an unlikely relationship between a man (Jung Jae-young) who gets washed up on a Seoul islet after a suicide attempt and a woman (Jung Ryeo-won) who has been isolating herself inside her room. I find that antics like the exchanging of messages through a bottle and the quest to get some jajangmyeon gave the story a sense of wonder instead of being demeaning. The movie is a great exploration of loneliness and feeling alone.  Director Paul Thomas Anderson’s rom-com “Punch-Drunk Love” stars Adam Sandler in one of his best roles. Sandler plays Barry Egan, an executive of a company selling novelty items who has social anxiety and anger management issues. He has been living a pretty solitary life, that is until his sister’s co-worker Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) enters his life. But his burgeoning love life is threatened when he falls victim to extortion. It gets a bit frenetic as Anderson shows us what it’s like inside Barry’s head and as the tension-filled romance progresses. It’s a visually exciting character study with an amazing score composed by Jon Brion. Watching this convinced me that everybody has a chance to find love. Click here for a list of warnings.  Dramedy “Skeleton Twins” follows the story of estranged siblings Milo (Bill Hader) and Maggie (Kristen Wiig) who reconnect while agreeing to live under one roof after they both commit a suicide attempt. While the beginning of the film is certainly jarring, the rest is a little more light-hearted as they try to heal from their troubled childhoods and unmet life expectations together. It’s not a movie where you expect to see Hader and Wiig make fart jokes and lip-sync to “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” together. But that’s exactly what you’ll find here. It’s a good look into adults living with depression and how families can help them cope. Click here for a list of warnings.  Another rom-com on the list is “Silver Linings Playbook” starring Bradley Cooper as Pat Solitano, a man with bipolar disorder who moves back with his parents after staying in a mental health hospital. He tries to get his wife back, even though she’s filed a restraining order against him. A widow named Tiffany—Jennifer Lawrence in her Oscar-winning role—offers to help him. But in exchange, she has asked him to be his partner for a ballroom dancing competition. It’s a bit messy and has been accused of being “anti-psychiatry,” but it offers insight on what it’s like to go through bipolar disorder and manic episodes. Ballroom dancing and rediscovering love aren’t cures but maybe they do help. Click here for a list of warnings.

Yassi Pressman sees surfing as a metaphor to mental health care,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/389701/yassi-pressman-sees-surfing-as-a-metaphor-to-mental-health-care/,"06:57 PM October 12, 2021","Yassi Pressman likens surfing in the water and braving the waves to taking care of her own mental health. Pressman explained why this is so in her Instagram page yesterday, Oct. 11, where she showed a short surfing video. “In Siargao I realized that my first couple of surfing lessons were very similar to the way I take care of my mental health,” she said. At that time, what Pressman needed was “some time to get away.” “I spontaneously planned a trip to the beach with no itinerary/schedule and ended up trying to learn how to surf,” she said. “To find some of the best surf spots in Siargao a boat has to drop you off in the middle of the ocean, then you got to paddle to get to the waves, and on some days you got to paddle really FAAAAAAR.” For her, it was very difficult, as she was not used to using her upper body, much more to “go against the current to get to the starting point.” She noted how the whole exercise requires patience because the surfer waits for waves “The actual wait for the wave makes me nervous,” she said. “There is a lot of suspense and build up,” she noted. “You have to time when to push up and keep your form. When I finally did it, the next thing I thought about was trying to balance in the rush of it all and stand up steady on my board. Or else I’ll fall,” she recalled.   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Yassi Pressman (@yassipressman)  “When you actually fall, you must think fast, don’t panic (which was hard considering you are actually being pulled by the waves under the water, right?) anyway, STAY RELAXED,” she advised. “You have to get some air then paddle for your life so that the next couple of waves do not come at you hard, and you won’t get in the way of any other person possibly surfing your way.” Falling is okay, says Pressman, and all that one needs is to just “breathe” and “paddle out of the chaos.” “Take a couple of breaths in a spot where the waves are calmer, and when you are ready start paddling back. Get back to the beginning, no matter how well you do, take the risk,” she added. “Magawa mo man in the beginning o hindi, don’t give up. Kaya mo yan. Try again.” (Whether you get to accomplish it right from the beginning or not, don’t give up. You can do it. Try again.) Aside from surfing, Pressman has also engaged in other fitness and sporting activities such as boxing.

Stroem thinks that because of the “tumultuous day and age” people face now, problems tend to pile up, but it is still important to “find a way to pick ourselves up.” He suggests seeking help from others, such as “a loved one, a therapist or even [man’s] best friend.”   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Markki Stroem (@markkistroem)  “We live in a world where APPEARANCES are oftentimes more important than REALITY,” he noted. “This could take a serious toll on us if we continue to keep our struggles to ourselves.” Stroem shared that he watched “House of Secrets: The Burari Deaths,” an Indian documentary, which horrified him, being about a man who neglected seeking help for his PTSD. The character later caused the death of his entire family. Stroem then shared that he sought help for his anxiety, depression and ADHD problems. “I started taking care of my Mind, Body and Soul. I try to expel toxicity, and keep positivity in my life,” he said. “Something I do in the mornings to calm my mind is Meditation and Yoga. These daily affirmations (and sweat sessions) are my love letters to the Universe to [embody what I want to become].” “Everyone has their own ways of taking care of their Mental Health,” Stroem believes. “It is time to be the captain of your own vessel, and steer it to a more [peaceful] state.” JB RELATED STORIES: Markki Stroem on first days of pandemic: ‘I was scared for my life’ LOOK: Markki Stroem goes nude in birthday shoot ‘on a mountain top’   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

Wurtzbach posted a video teaser on her Instagram account yesterday, Aug. 9, showing off several individuals who fearlessly shared their bout with mental illness. “Hindi ka nag- iisa (You are not alone),” Wurtzbach said yesterday, Aug. 9, through an Instagram post that came with a teaser video for “Holding Space: Voices of Hope.” “If you know someone growing through a silent battle in their life that they are afraid and hesitant to talk about (or ikaw mismo ang nakakaramdam nito) [or you are the one experiencing it], always remember that when we hold space for the people.

"No health without mental health: A lesson from Globe, DepEd Tayo Naman! webinar",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/384531/no-health-without-mental-health-a-lesson-from-globe-deped-tayo-naman-webinar/,"12:34 PM June 18, 2021"," “There is no health without mental health.” This was underscored by Philippine Mental Health Association (PMHA) member, Dr. Bernardino A. Vicente, at the fourth TAYO Naman! (Tulong, Alaga, Yakap at Oras para sa mga Tagapagtaguyod ng Edukasyon) session titled “Understanding and Managing Common Mental Disorders and other Psychological Concerns.” This webinar series is organized by Globe and the Department of Education (DepEd). While people are busy taking care of their physical health to avoid contracting the virus, Dr. Vicente said that many Filipinos suffer from mental health problems, resulting in about a 25.7 percent surge in the country’s suicide incidence in 2020. “Mental disorders are not uncommon. It’s like ‘yung physical illness natin. COVID-19 does not only cause physical health concerns but also psychological disorders. The pandemic is really stressful to almost everyone and is actually the reason why there is an increase in depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders, including suicide,” he said. Thus, he reiterated the World Health Organization (WHO)’s statement that mental health and physical health are two inseparable things that one must care about for their own well-being. Dr. Vicente likewise explained that positive mental health promotes a longer life, slows the aging process, and helps provide a better prognosis when illness strikes. Thus, productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other people, the ability to adapt to change, and cope with adversities are vital in keeping a healthy mind. Stress from the current situation is also a challenge for educators, students, and their parents who have to cope with online learning and new ways of doing things. Time management, physical activities, relaxation training, continued social support and communication, and proper diet and nutrition are some recommended methods to help ease stress. Having a list of activities or memories that make one happy, and seven to eight hours of sleep are also handy in managing stress and achieving good mental health. “In stress management, you cannot manage something that you do not know. So 90 percent of stress management relies on becoming aware of what stresses you. Generally, it may come from you, from your family, or from work. It is not the number of stressors you have, it is the way you carry them,” he added Another key to prevent or solve mental disorders, aside from medical intervention and a healthy lifestyle, is to understand its concept. Dr. Vicente said to watch out for abnormal psychological and behavioral manifestations with associations of distress and dysfunction, that are recurrent or carried over a sustained period. Dr. Vicente also underscored that, aside from medical intervention and a healthy lifestyle, an important key to prevent or manage mental disorders is to understand their nature and symptoms.  He emphasized the need to watch out for red flags of psychological and behavioral manifestations associated with distress and dysfunction that are recurrent or carried over a sustained period to be able to diagnose if a person has a mental disorder.

Some seasons feel short, some feel too long. But all seasons pass.” The singer thinks there are more ways of addressing mental health problems and one should not think that being in a depressed phase is forever. She encourages positivity and looking forward to the future.   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Moira (@moiradelatorre)  “Sometimes we stay thinking this is all there is for us. But if you keep walking, you’ll see that there are beautiful plans for you. Plans we may not understand at the moment, but they are meant to prosper you, give you hope [and] a future,” she added. “So don’t be afraid to hope again because our Hope has come. You are stronger [and] braver than you think.” More importantly, Dela Torre urged those suffering from mental health issues to be brave enough to seek counseling. “Don’t be afraid to seek counsel or to get therapy. Opening up helps too,” she appealed. “It’s nothing to be ashamed of. It’s helped me a lot to know it’s okay not to be okay.

May being the “Mental Health Awareness” month, Magalona reminded everyone to “check in with yourself regularly” as seen in her Instagram page today, May 3. “See how you’re doing and make sure to honor your emotions by holding space for them and just allowing them to come,” she said. “As humans, we are designed to use our intelligence to protect ourselves from threats which is why when unpleasant feelings of anxiety and fear start to creep in, our minds tend to take over and deny our emotions,” she noted. Magalona stated that while protecting one’s self is necessary, it is also equally important to freely feel one’s feelings, and to release these feelings so they would not remain repressed in our bodies. “Emotion means ‘energy in motion’ so when they don’t get released, they turn into stagnant energies that cause blockages in the body which can eventually lead to diseases and disorders,” she said. Magalona believes that there will be an “imbalance” if we only welcome emotions that make us feel good and deny those that will upset us.   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Maxene Magalona-Mananquil (@maxenemagalona)  “This is why ‘it’s okay to not be okay,’” she pointed out. “So go ahead and cry if you need to. Get angry if you must.

How student leaders can fight for peers’ mental health,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380750/how-student-leaders-can-fight-for-peers-mental-health/,"06:36 PM March 22, 2021","They are empowered to reach out to fellow students on a more personal level, as students are more reluctant to open up to a counselor Multiple sectors have recognized the importance of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and with the emergence of online distance learning (ODL). Numerous organizations have also promoted mental health awareness through social media and other platforms. Awareness, however, cannot go far without action.  Students need concrete initiatives that can have a significant impact on their lives. That said, fellow students may be in the best position to create that change. Student leaders are empowered to reach out to students on a more personal level and have the ability to positively impact their mental and emotional well-being.  Student leaders would already have a strong rapport with their peers. This enables them to better understand the needs of their fellow students.  The need to support individual students will give class officers a bigger role. Leading a small class of 30 to 40 students may feel unimportant but these officers play an invaluable role in ensuring that the concerns of each one is heard and addressed. Attending to the well-being of all the students can be overwhelming for just administrators and teachers.   Isabela Gigante, a former student council president of Ateneo de Cebu (2019-2020) said that students would be more reluctant to open up to a counselor. This is not to diminish the importance of professional counselors. In fact, their roles are so important especially now, and student leaders should do everything they can to assist them.  Even before the pandemic, Gigante’s council focused on eliminating the mental health stigma present in their school. She acknowledged that the topic was still considered taboo despite the “occasional talks” about it.  Gigante aimed to address this by promoting awareness and empowering student leaders to deal with mental health issues. She and the council implemented a project called “Me for Placards of Positivity,” creating and sharing infographics with the school community. Additionally, the “Me for The Mental Health of Others” initiative brought in professionals to teach student leaders on “how to appropriately respond to mental health problems.”  Pierre Reniva, moderator of the Xavier School San Juan student council, said that the student council must “journey with each student” to ensure that “no one gets left behind.” Effective mental health initiatives can be small but personal and relatable.  The Xavier School student council released regular posters and quotes to remind the students that “they are not alone” in their journey this school year. The student council can also play an important role in keeping the student body informed in a lighter and more positive manner, so the student council put out an engaging video series called “Timeout” that brings relevant social issues closer to the students.   Mental health can also act as a springboard for promoting other aspects of a holistic student formation. When individuals are nurtured, education programs can then focus on the community. Mental health can equip students to be high-minded and engaged citizens. “We really wanted to start with the self,” said Reniva. He and the student council wanted to ensure that students were internally well before they tackled external issues.  Research suggests a positive relationship between the quality of mental health programs and academic performance in students. Effective mental health programs also encourage student involvement in extracurricular activities.  In ensuring that students have the necessary mental and emotional support, schools can expect better reception of other initiatives.  Leadership, on any level, is more than just an empty title. It’s not just a position. Student leadership extends far beyond the student council. Every student has the opportunity to uplift the mental health of their peers.  Personally, I’ve found leadership in extracurricular activities or committees to be invaluable. Leaders in these organizations can look out for the well-being of their own members and empower them to do the same for their peers. In the years to come, the student leaders will continue to play an important role in supporting this integral part of student life.

Joson articulated some pieces of advice she believes could help one’s mental health as per her Instagram post Feb. 6, where she posted affirmations from blogger and author Rontier A. Whitfield.   A post shared by Elisse Joson (@elissejosonn) “If it doesn’t give me peace, I no longer entertain it,” she said in her post. Joson is making her mental health a priority and she advises that “a break is always good for you”. She shared some activities which make her address her need for a sound mind. One is taking a pause. “Whatever I’m doing, I take a minute to pause,” she said. Two is reading books or any material which will help her reflect. “It’s like I’m connecting to Him and He’s reaching out to me,” Joson explained. At some point, Joson needs to disconnect from the real world. “No social media for me. And sometimes, distancing from people too, for a little while… so for my friends or supporters that are offended, know that I am just giving myself some time off for my well-being but I care. And appreciate you,” she said. Taking a shower is another way she resets. “Oh, this helps me so much. Immediate positive response from my whole body, any scientific explanation for this?” she said. If a shower can’t be done, Joson suggests splashing water on one’s face to get refreshed. Lastly, Joson recommends naming one thing that you’re grateful for. “Take care of yourself, you are important,” she emphasized.

MindReform: How my friends and I built a mental health resource for other youths,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/377303/mindreform-how-my-friends-and-i-built-a-mental-health-resource-for-other-youths/,"03:27 PM January 11, 2021","'From solely focusing on the technicalities, I found a genuine passion and drive to reach out to people. I was building a community' In the past months, I have learned of the struggles many of my friends and schoolmates were facing as they coped with the pandemic. But even before the pandemic, I was aware of students with anxiety problems and I was all too familiar with the stress brought about by schoolwork. I also experienced firsthand the toxic culture of apathy toward mental health issues. The elephant in the room—the stigma that leads others to call emotions “hypersensitivity”—casts a looming shadow over our society. I knew I couldn’t change this culture overnight. But I also knew that being indifferent is part of the problem. Hence, I went about creating a platform that would not merely spread awareness about mental health but also provide a service that people could use and integrate in their own lives. Mental health isn’t a one-time movement, it’s changing the paradigm and reforming our attitude toward mental health. Mental health is a pertinent issue given the COVID-19 pandemic and the state of the Philippines. Prof. Anne Rivelda published an article calling for change in the discussion on mental health. She wrote that the “stigma toward people with mental illnesses in the Philippines is rampant.” She attributes this to the “lack of sensitivity in referencing mental health issues.” Not only is the stigma toward mental health problematic but our country generally lacks the resources to allow people to properly cope. Society is calling for change, now more than ever. At a time when we are more vulnerable to feelings of anxiety and fear due to the pandemic, such a call resonates even stronger.  It was the middle of April and quarantine and social distancing were just becoming commonplace. I received a phone call that changed the direction of my quarantined life. A friend a few years my senior pitched an enticing albeit vague idea of a mental health website. I haven’t done web development for quite a while, and I knew next to nothing about mental health. But the prospect of doing something with a purpose seemed a lot more appealing than emptying my Netflix watchlist. The process was anything but glamorous. We stumbled in the dark for the most part, unsure of what we actually wanted to make. Everything from a social media platform to a resource listing was on the table. But gradually, as we reached out to more experts and got more feedback, we had a clearer vision of the path we wanted to take. With that we came to have two spheres of focus: self-care and peer support. Our objective became to provide and connect people with mental health support, be it through people or resources. But not only did MindReform change my direction, it also gave me direction during the quarantine. As the MindReform platform grew in scope and capacity, I believe I grew parallel with it. In line with the theme of self-care, the team (which included cofounder and operations head Anton Labos and research head Lance Dy) and I compiled a list of mental health resources based on the different emotions a user might be feeling. As time passed, the resource would be dynamically curated based on how people interact with them. But we also knew that resources alone would not be enough. We also developed a social media platform catered toward promoting peer support, and discouraging toxic posts. At first, it was just me creating any other website. I was more focused on the technical aspects of programming and designing. But as we got the word out, and some people started using it, what started off as a project became so much more. It wasn’t just about the code or choosing a color scheme. MindReform was about the people. In the same way, from solely focusing on the technicalities, I found a genuine passion and drive to reach out to people. I wasn’t just building a website or app. I was building a community. I was creating an avenue for people to express and care for themselves. In truth, it wasn’t successfully making a product that has and continues to bring me fulfilment. It was the small expressions of gratitude from users and our partners that inspire me and give me hope. One user, David Tan, a high school student, said in an interview that the platform made him feel “comfortable while at the same time safe.” He noted how MindReform provides a closed space to freely share thoughts and experiences while at the same time find support from others. He finds that the website allows him to “pinpoint how he is feeling,” and therefore better acknowledge his emotions. Tan said he imagines students like him would be able to express their stress and anxiety, and find resources to cope on the site. As opposed to other social media platforms, MindReform encourages people to share the good and the bad. In doing so, they may hopefully come to terms with both. Tan and other users also agree that when used properly, MindReform could create a more positive and understanding community overall. Why? Such a simple question can be straining and even painful to answer. It’s not where the train is headed, nor where it came from. It is the fuel that keeps it running. Throughout the quarantine, I asked myself why I was putting so much time and effort into MindReform in the first place. It was the people who have and continue to benefit from MindReform that fuel me. Those people gave me hope. They are what inspired me to reach out to others. They give me hope that there is a better future for mental health, and for the youth, whatever the circumstances now may be. And that, I believe, is precisely what mental health should be about. Mental health is finding a reason and drive to hope and aspire for a better future. It is finding the resilience to keep that fuel alive even in dire times. The time is overdue for society’s mind reform. –CONTRIBUTED The author is the co-founder and lead developer of www.themindreform.com and is a student at Xavier School San Juan.

Living near green space could boost teens’ and seniors’ mental health,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/330170/living-near-green-space-could-boost-teens-and-seniors-mental-health/,"07:19 PM April 01, 2019","New United States research has found that living just a few blocks away from “green space” could be good for a teenager’s mental health. Carried out by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Center for Health Policy Research, the new study looked at data gathered from the California Health Interview Survey carried out between 2011 to 2014, which included a total of 81,102 households, composed of 4,538 teenagers and 81,102 adults. The households’ surrounding greenness was measured using a satellite-generated map showing the density of vegetation. The findings, published in the journal Health & Place, showed that when teenagers lived within 350 meters (a radius of around two city blocks) of a large amount of greenness, a level found in the top 25 percentile, they are 36 percent less likely to have serious psychological distress than a teen living in an area with greenness in the bottom 25 percentile. Higher levels of exposure to greenness were also significantly associated with lower rates of serious psychological distress in adults age 65 and older. However, greenness did not appear to have the same benefits for younger adults. The researchers cite previous research, which suggests that greenness may have a stronger effect on teens and seniors as they are more likely to stay within their neighborhoods and have a stronger response to their local environment. Co-author of the study Ying-Ying Meng also added that as teenagers’ brains are still developing, the finding that teens benefit more from being near green space is a significant one. “The study suggests that older adults and teens seem to respond well mentally to nearby ‘doses’ of plants and trees,” said added Meng. CE/JB RELATED STORIES Sleep deprived teens more likely to engage in self-harm Take a hike: Walking can reduce cancer risks  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
"TV in the bedroom could be bad for children’s physical, mental health",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/327144/p2fb-tv-in-the-bedroom-could-be-bad-for-childrens-physical-mental-health/,"06:29 PM March 10, 2019","New Canadian research has found that growing up with a TV in the bedroom may have a negative effect on children’s physical and mental health in their teenage years. Carried out by researchers at the Université de Montréal’s School of Psychoeducation and the INRS-IAF, a research institute affiliated with the Université du Québec à Montréal, the study looked at data gathered from 1,859 Quebec children born between the spring of 1997 and the spring of 1998. The children were followed from age four, and researchers assessed the children’s health at age 12 and 13. This was done by measuring body mass index and asking the children to report on their intake of unhealthy foods, as well as complete a short version of the Children’s Depression Inventory. Teachers were also asked to rate the children’s exposure to emotional stress, how the children got along with others in the class and whether they were bullied. According to the researchers, these measures of health are also good predictors of physical and mental health in adulthood. The findings, published in the journal Pediatric Research, showed that having a TV in the bedroom at age four was linked to a significantly higher body mass index, unhealthier eating habits, lower levels of sociability, and higher levels of emotional distress, depressive symptoms, victimization and physical aggression later in childhood, regardless of any individual and family factors that might have increased the risk of such problems. “The early years are a critical period in a child’s development,” said study author Linda Pagani, who will be discussing the study on Thursday at the International Convention of Psychological Science in Paris. “Intuitively, parents know that how their children spend their leisure time will impact their well-being over the long term,” she added. “And with TV being their most common pastime, it’s clear that the many hours they spend in front of the screen is having an effect on their growth and development, especially if the TV is in a private place like the bedroom.” “With their attention diverted, children risk not having enough physical and social interactions to promote proper physical and socio-emotional development,” Pagani said. “Today, given the portability of digital devices and the constant switching from one device to another, the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics clearly have reason to encourage screen-free zones and screen-free locations at home, especially given the implications for the growth and development of children. Our research supports a strong stance for parental guidelines on the availability and accessibility of TVs and other devices,” she noted.

"Women must look after mental health before conception, says study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/323270/women-must-look-after-mental-health-before-conception-says-study/,"04:27 PM February 04, 2019","New Australian research has found that women who suffer from depression before falling pregnant are more likely to have children with psychosocial problems, suggesting that looking after mental health before pregnancy could be as important as other health factors such as exercise and a healthy diet. Carried out by researchers at the University of Queensland and the University of Newcastle, the new study looked at 20 years of years of data on 5,532 children under the age of 12 and their mothers. The findings, published in the Archives of Women’s Mental Health, showed that women who experienced depression before conception were also more likely to have poorer mental health after birth. In addition, their children were also more likely to have poor psychosocial outcomes, such as feeling angry or having problems focusing their attention. “Women who are depressed before conception are more likely to have depression after birth, which can have a negative influence on parenting,” said researcher Dr. Katrina Moss. “Their children are more likely to feel angry or worried, not get along with others, not smile or laugh, or have difficulty paying attention and keeping up at school.” “If you’re planning a family, it’s important to add mental health to your pre-conception checklist, along with more well-known factors like stopping smoking and drinking, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising,” adds Dr. Moss. “If symptoms of depression decrease before pregnancy, outcomes are better for women and their children.” “If you think you might have depression, start by talking to your GP; ask for help and keep asking until you find the help that works for you,” she advised. One in five Australian mothers experience depression according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, which makes it a significant public health concern, according to the team.

5 ways to boost your mental health this year,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/321055/5-ways-to-boost-your-mental-health-this-year/,"06:20 PM January 14, 2019"," We all know eating right and keeping fit is important, but here are some simple ways to also look after your mental health in 2019. Make time for cultural events Research published just last month found that seniors could lower their chances of depression in old age by making regular trips out to the cinema, theater or museums. After looking at 2,148 people over the age of 50, the team from University College London found that those who head out to events such as films, plays or exhibitions every few months had a 32 percent lower risk of developing depression, with those attending once a month or more having a 48 percent lower risk. Eat raw veggies If you’re struggling to add more fruits and vegetables into your diet this year then changing the way you eat them could be enough to give you a health boost. A study that looked at 422 participants aged 18 to 25 found that raw fruit and vegetables appeared to be more beneficial for mental health than cooked, canned and processed options and were associated with fewer depressive symptoms, a more positive mood, higher life satisfaction, and higher flourishing, which is a feeling of being engaged in your work and daily life and having a sense of purpose. Top up your vitamin D A recent Irish study found that adults over the age of 50 with a low level of vitamin D, defined as lower than 30 nanograms per milliliter (nmol/L), have a 75 percent increased risk of developing depression compared to those with a sufficient level over 50 nmol/L. The researchers suggest that boosting vitamin D levels with supplements or by including vitamin-D rich foods in the diet, such as fatty fish, eggs, fortified dairy products, calf’s liver, and portobello mushrooms, could be an easy and inexpensive way to help prevent the development of depression. A lack of daylight, which is also a main source of vitamin D, has also been linked to an increased risk of depression. Get your hearing checked A study published at the beginning of the year found that hearing loss as we age could be linked to an increased risk of depression. After looking at a group of adults over 50, the US researchers found that those with mild hearing loss were almost twice as likely to have symptoms of depression than those with normal hearing, and those with severe hearing loss had over four times the odds of having depressive symptoms. The team added that as hearing loss is easy to diagnose and treat, looking after hearing could be a simple way to ease or prevent depression. Try to spend less time on your phone A team of researchers at San Diego State University and the University of Georgia, USA have carried out various studies on how the rise in screen time is affecting our mental health, finding in one study that teens who spent more than seven hours a day on screens were twice as likely as those spending just one hour to have been diagnosed with anxiety or depression, and in another that teens who spent more time in front of screens were less happy than those who spent more time partaking in non-screen activities such as sports and reading. However, to make it easier for us to put down our phones they don’t suggest cutting out screen time altogether, saying that limiting use is the key to better mental health and greater happiness.

Led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) and published in the journal Environment International, the new study looked at 3,599 participants from four European cities: Barcelona, Spain, Doetinchem, the Netherlands, Kaunas, Lithuania, and Stoke-on-Trent, UK. Participants were asked to answer a questionnaire about their commuting habits, including whether they commuted through a natural environment or not and how often, and their mental health. In the study natural environments were defined as all public and private outdoor spaces that contain ‘green’ and/or ‘blue’ natural elements such as trees or forests, and included both city parks and natural parks and all types of water. The findings showed that participants who commuted daily through natural environments had on average a 2.74 point higher mental health score compared to those who commuted through natural environments less frequently. Those who commuted daily through a natural environment were also more likely to be active commuters, who cycled or walked to work. Moreover, the positive association with mental health was even stronger among those who reported active commuting through natural environments. However, active commuting alone was not associated with improved mental health, and the quality of the natural environment also did not appear to influence the results. “From previous experimental studies we knew that physical activity in natural environments can reduce stress, improve mood and mental restoration when compared to the equivalent activity in urban environments,” commented Wilma Zijlema, ISGlobal researcher and first author of the study. “Although this study is the first of its kind to our knowledge and, therefore, more research will be needed, our data show that commuting through these natural spaces alone may also have a positive effect on mental health.” NVG RELATED STORIES: Growing up in polluted neighborhoods could lead to more hospital visits for asthmatic children Exercising 3 to 5 times a week brings biggest benefits for mental health, says study  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
Being in an on-off relationship could be bad for your mental health,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/304107/p2fb-being-in-an-on-off-relationship-could-be-bad-for-your-mental-health/,"03:51 PM August 26, 2018","It may be exciting and dramatic for some, but new United States research has found that on-off relationships could be harming mental health. Carried out by researchers at the University of Missouri, the new study looked at data from 545 participants, including 279 in same‐sex and 266 in different‐sex relationships. The researchers found that the rate of breaking up and getting back together was similar across relationship types, but more common in male-male relationships compared with female-female and different‐sex relationships. However, regardless of the relationship type, the more on-off a couple was, the more psychological distress symptoms the members exhibited such as depression and anxiety. Previous research has estimated that more than 60 percent of adults have been involved in on-off relationships, and more than one-third of couples who lived together have at some point ended the relationship before later reconciling. In addition, compared to relationships without this pattern, on-off relationships have been associated with higher rates of abuse, poorer communication and lower levels of commitment. “Breaking up and getting back together is not always a bad omen for a couple,” said study author Kale Monk. “In fact, for some couples, breaking up can help partners realize the importance of their relationship, contributing to a healthier, more committed unions. On the other hand, partners who are routinely breaking up and getting back together could be negatively impacted by the pattern.” The researchers added that couples break up and later get back together for many different reasons, although a common one is necessity or practicality, such as for financial reasons or because they feel they have invested too much time into the relationship to leave. However, Monk warns against getting back together because of feeling of obligation. “The findings suggest that people who find themselves regularly breaking up and getting back together with their partners need to ‘look under the hood’ of their relationships to determine what’s going on,” he added. “If partners are honest about the pattern, they can take the necessary steps to maintain their relationships or safely end them. This is vital for preserving their well-being.” The findings can be found published online in the journal Family Relations.

"Exercising 3 to 5 times a week brings biggest benefits for mental health, says study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/303152/p2fb-exercising-3-5-times-week-brings-biggest-benefits-mental-health-says-study/,"08:33 PM August 16, 2018","A new large-scale United States study has found that people who exercise report having 1.5 fewer days of poor mental health a month, compared to people who do not exercise. However, working out too much could actually have the opposite effect. Carried out by a team at Yale University, Massachusetts General Hospital and the Laureate Institute for Brain Research, U.S., along with the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, this is the largest observational study of its kind. It looked at more than 1.2 million people in the U.S. to investigate the influence of exercise type, frequency, duration and intensity on mental health. Participants were asked to complete surveys in 2011, 2013 and 2015, answering questions on their physical health, exercise behaviors and their mental health, reporting on how many days they would rate it as “not good” based on stress, depression and emotional problems. The study did not take mental health disorders other than depression into account. The researchers included 75 kinds of exercise in the study, from childcare, housework, lawn-mowing and fishing to cycling, running and skiing. They also took into account factors like age, gender and previous diagnoses of depression. On average, participants experienced 3.4 days of poor mental health a month. However, those who exercised reported two days of poor mental health each month, 1.5 fewer days than those who reported doing no exercise, and a reduction of 43.2 percent. “Exercise is associated with a lower mental health burden across people no matter their age, race, gender, household income and education level,” said study co-author Dr. Adam Chekroud. “Excitingly, the specifics of the regime, like the type, duration and frequency, played an important role in this association.” All the types of exercise included in the study were associated with improved mental health. Even doing household chores was linked to a 10 percent reduction in poor mental health days a month, equal to around half a day. The largest reductions were seen for team sports (22.3 percent reduction), cycling (21.6 percent), and aerobic and gym activities (20.1 percent). “Our finding that team sports are associated with the lowest mental health burden may indicate that social activities promote resilience and reduce depression by reducing social withdrawal and isolation, giving social sports an edge over other kinds,” explained Dr. Chekroud. However, when it came to how often and how long people should exercise for to reap the benefits, it appeared that more was not always better. Those who exercised for 45 minutes, three to five times a week, had better mental health than those who exercised less or more each week. Dr. Chekroud said, “Previously, people have believed that the more exercise you do, the better your mental health, but our study suggests that this is not the case. Doing exercise more than 23 times a month, or exercising for longer than 90 minute sessions is associated with worse mental health.” The results were published in The Lancet Psychiatry.

2 men with mental health issues escape care home to party,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/302399/2-men-mental-health-issues-escape-care-home-party/,"04:03 PM August 08, 2018","Two men went missing at a German care home and were later found after they had partied at a local music festival. The two men, who were initially reported as elderly, were discovered missing from a care home in northern Germany between Aug. 2 and 4, according to Deutsche Welle. Authorities previously reported the two men left a retirement home and were found at the annual Wacken Open Air metal music festival in Wacken, Schleswig-Holstein. A more recent report clarified that Itzehoe police did not find the men within the festival grounds. The men were instead picked up at a bus stop on a Wacken main road around 3 a.m. German time. They did not have tickets for the festival yet they were found intoxicated. The two men, aged 58 and 59, had mental health issues and were taken to a medical tent set up for attendees of the music festival after they were found. They apparently missed the last bus. They were later sent back to their care home through a taxi with a police escort. The initial reports described the two men as elderly who escaped a “retirement home” to party at at Wacken Open Air. This earned them recognition on social media as “heroes,” as reported by Deutsche Welle. The Wacken Open Air is an annual festival for the celebration of heavy metal music. It is considered the biggest event of its kind in the world. The festival first started as a small event in 1990 with only around 800 attendees and six local German bands. This year’s festival had around 75,000 visitors and hosted more than 100 bands.

The WHO has included sex addiction — identified as “compulsive sexual behavior disorder — in its updated list version of the International Classification of Diseases, released last June 18. In the document, “compulsive sexual behavior disorder” is characterized by “a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behavior.” The symptoms for the disorder have been classified as repetitive sexual activities that become the focus of one person, which results to neglecting his/her health or other activities. It also cited unsuccessful attempts to reduce sexual behavior, and continuing such activities despite harmful consequences, while deriving little or no satisfaction from it. Persons can be identified as sex addicts if they deal with the symptoms at least six months or more, and have caused them “distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.” The United Kingdom’s Royal College of Psychiatrists member Dr. Valerie Voon said that someone who suffers from the disorder “tends to [have it] hidden as it’s shameful” as those who are addicts do not seek help. “Adding this to the WHO list is an excellent step for patients, as it allows them to recognize that they are suffering with a problem,” she said in a report by The Sun. “It takes it out of the shadows and means they are able to seek help for it.” Katrina Hallare/JB RELATED STORIES: Video gaming addictive like crack — WHO People’s heightened interest in sex during Christmas brings baby boom 9 months later, says study    CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
"Eating your green raw could have bigger benefits for mental health, says new study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/292174/p2fb-eating-green-raw-bigger-benefits-mental-health-says-new-study/,"08:47 PM April 19, 2018","New research has suggested that if you want to boost your mental health, eating raw fruit and vegetables could be more beneficial than cooked, canned and processed options. Carried out by the University of Otago, New Zealand, the study set out to see if how we ate our fruit and vegetables could be just as important, if not more so, as how many we ate. Although many public health campaigns have pushed the idea of aiming for five portions of fruit and vegetables a day in any form, the new findings suggest it could also be important to consider in what way produce was prepared and consumed, especially for mental health benefits. For the study, the team looked at 422 participants aged 18 to 25 and living in New Zealand and the United States. They chose to focus on this age group as young adults typically have the lowest consumption of fruit and vegetables and are at a high risk for mental health disorders. Participants were surveyed on their consumption of raw, cooked, and processed fruits and vegetables, as well as their negative and positive mental health, and lifestyle and demographic factors which could affect mental health such as exercise, sleep, unhealthy diet, chronic health conditions, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender. The team found that eating raw fruit and vegetables was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, higher positive mood, higher life satisfaction, and higher flourishing, which is a feeling of being engaged in your work and daily life and having a sense of purpose. These mental health benefits were significantly reduced for cooked, canned and processed fruits and vegetables, with eating processed fruit and vegetables associated only with a higher positive mood. Lead author Dr. Tamlin Conner believes raw food could be more beneficial for mental health as cooking and processing fruit and vegetables can diminish nutrient levels. “This likely limits the delivery of nutrients that are essential for optimal emotional functioning,” she explains, adding that, “[t]his research is increasingly vital as lifestyle approaches such as dietary change may provide an accessible, safe, and adjuvant approach to improving mental health.” The top 10 raw foods related to better mental health were carrots, bananas, apples, dark leafy greens such as spinach, grapefruit, lettuce, citrus fruits, fresh berries, cucumber and kiwifruit. The results can be found published online in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.

In the first quarter of 2021, the numbers of calls to crisis hotlines had increased fourfold, with calls averaging at 1,000 per month. Compared to 1,540 calls recorded from January to March 2020, the rise in number has caused alarm in the mental health community. According to the National Center for Mental Health, the reasons for most of the calls received were anxiety and depression, stressful life events, interpersonal and mood concerns, and referral services. This indicates that people are finding ways to address their mental health concerns and gain access to services dedicated to this. The question, though, is that, is there enough access for everyone? In response to this, MentalHealthPH launched Kapwa, a menu-based chatbot on Twitter, to make struggling people feel that their concerns are being heard and that in emergency situations, they can be directed to mental health services available for them, the nongovernmental organization said in a statement. Established in 2016, MentalHealthPH is a Securities and Exchange Commission-registered advocacy organization that aims to promote and protect mental health in the Philippines through digital technology. Using the Kapwa chatbot is simple. Just send a direct message to the Kapwa Twitter account (@kapwamh), and Kapwa, the online persona, will guide you to achieve what mental health service you need. It can be as simple as Kapwa providing links to meditation videos when you’re stressed. To make it more user-friendly, it also uses conversational Filipino as the medium of language, aiming to reach as many Filipinos.

Bonuan Buquig National High School wins global prize for environmental action,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/431190/bonuan-buquig-national-high-school-wins-global-prize-for-environmental-action/,"03:22 PM October 28, 2022","On Oct. 19, Bonuan Buquig National High School (BBNHS) won the World’s Best School Prize for Environmental Action. The Dagupan City school restored lost mangroves to reverse the environmental damage affecting its students. The prize recognizes the importance of youth, students and schools that engage in global warming solutions. BBNHS bested other finalists like Green School Bali in Indonesia and the International School of Zug and Luzern in Switzerland. G. L. David Memorial Integrated School in Balanga City, Bataan, was shortlisted for the World’s Best School Prize for Community Collaboration. Dunoon Grammar School in the United Kingdom won the award. Malitbog National High School in Calinog, Iloilo, was shortlisted for the World’s Best School Prize for Supporting Healthy Lives. The award went to Curie Metropolitan High School in the United States. The World’s Best School Prize for Innovation was awarded to Escuela Emilia Lascar in Chile. Project Shelter Wakadogo in Uganda won the World’s Best School Prize for Overcoming Adversity.  The five World’s Best School Prizes honor schools everywhere for their pivotal part in producing the next generation of students and contributing to society’s progress. Each winning school will receive $50,000 to help sustain and improve its work and fortify its school and community. BBNHS plans to use the prize money to build a nursery that could support about 50,000 mangrove seedlings yearly and fund research to improve their mangrove propagation and preservation. Being only a meter above sea level, Dagupan is vulnerable to floods. In 2009, Typhoon “Pepeng” (international name: Pharma) left most of the city submerged, with fishponds, rice fields and other industries destroyed. The city government dredged rivers to minimize flooding. However, the mangroves died off, too—the rivers were exposed to the sun’s direct heat and killed off aquatic life crucial to the ecosystem. With their primary food source gone, many students had to stop schooling to support their families. To save the waterways, the school launched a mangrove planting program. “The first thing we did was meet the entire team including the head teachers,” said teacher Lin Ventenilla. “Different ideas came in, and they said, ‘As we embark on this mangrove planting, we will also integrate into our specific learning areas how important the activity is.’ It must be connected with the students, their studies and their way of life.” The school contacted the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to learn more about planting mangroves. To help its students and save the local environment, BBNHS mobilizes over a hundred volunteers and plants thousands of mangrove propagules annually, building new homes for marine life.  “It is indeed a much-needed project,” said Winston, a student at BBNHS. “It’s for myself, my family and all the people who depend on the waterways for our livelihood.” “For 12 years, we’ve been doing this because of our love for nature,” said principal Renato Santillan. “Even if it is a small and simple endeavor, it has a far-reaching effect.” Today, the mangroves along the Longos riverbanks are almost restored and stable. The fish stocks have since returned, and the waterways are clean. “The Bakawan Mangrove Planting Project is not all about planting mangroves,” said a student named Ken. “It also covers coastal cleanup.” In 2014, BBNHS began an international coastal cleanup. Volunteers collected garbage along Bonuan Beach. They segregated biodegradable and nonbiodegradable trash and upcycled plastics into plant pots and decor. The school also planted trees to rehabilitate a local dump site.Added Ventenilla, “We cannot prepare the future for our learners, but we can prepare them for the future. We want them to realize that their actions will also benefit the next generation after them.” About 50,000 people worldwide voted for their favorite schools. Winners were chosen based on rigorous criteria by a judging academy involving distinguished leaders worldwide: academics, educators, NGOs, social entrepreneurs, government, civil society, and the private sector. All 50 shortlisted schools across the five prizes will share their best practices through School Transformation tool kits, demonstrating their innovative approaches. The step-by-step methods will enable others to replicate their success and help upgrade education everywhere. Available on the new T4 Communities app launched at World Education Week.  The World’s Best School Prizes was launched this year by T4 Education, together with Accenture, American Express, Yayasan Hasanah, Templeton World Charity Foundation, and Lemann Foundation. It shares the best practices of schools that impact their learners’ lives, making a real difference in their neighborhoods. Vikas Pota, founder of T4 Education and the World’s Best School Prizes, said: “It’s time for world leaders to sit up and listen to schools like Bonuan Buquig National High School in the Philippines. Far too many children will continue to be left behind in the wake of COVID unless governments take urgent action to tackle the education crisis. “As a first step, they must turn to the knowledge and experience contained within our schools because those at the frontlines of education know better than anyone else the change we need to see. We founded the World’s Best School Prizes to surface the expertise of trailblazing schools from every corner of the globe so that leaders can learn from their incredible stories.” Peter Lacy, Accenture global management committee member, said: “Congratulations to Bonuan Buquig National High School for winning the first-ever World’s Best School Prize for Environmental Action. Teachers everywhere will be inspired by the example of this outstanding Philippine school, whose inspirational work is lighting the way towards a better future.” Madge Thomas, head of corporate sustainability at American Express, said, “I want to congratulate Bonuan Buquig National High School for this fantastic achievement. We are pleased to recognize students and educators taking action in schools to protect the environment and their futures.

Beat inflation: How healthy eating can save you money,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/427510/beat-inflation-how-healthy-eating-can-save-you-money/,"05:10 PM September 12, 2022","Food prices are still rising due to uncontrollable factors. But this should not stop you from achieving your lifestyle goals of eating healthier foods and staying more active. You can still eat healthy even if you are on a tight budget. Being more aware of your food consumption behavior can motivate you to spend money wisely, choosing only the foods that can greatly contribute to your health and well-being. Analyze your current food expenses How much money do you usually spend on sweet snacks and drinks from coffee shops in a day? How often do you eat out or order restaurant foods online? How many high-calorie ultra-processed foods do you buy from the supermarket on a weekly basis? Just imagine how much money you can save if you can just lessen or eliminate the foods that your body doesn’t need. Extra expenses that you usually spend on junk foods, alcohol, and sweet drinks can be allotted instead to healthier foods, fitness needs (online fitness subscriptions, personal trainer, fitness equipment, and gym membership), vitamins and supplements, and health check-ups. Stick to a monthly food budget (from grocery shopping to eating out),  making sure that you mainly focus on buying healthy and satisfying foods that can help achieve your goals of having a strong and disease-free body. Your total budget will depend on your income, food preference, lifestyle, weight and fitness goals (weight loss, maintenance to gain). Healthy eating doesn’t have to be expensive. You just need to be wise and systematic when it comes to food planning. Make efforts to prepare home-cooked meals Prepare your simple meals at home to save money. Give time for food planning, grocery shopping (which can now be easily done online with a minimal delivery fee), and cooking. Set your health goals and create your budget so you can manage your healthy eating well. I eat home cooked-meals six days a week and eat out once a week. For the past 2.5 years, on average, I spend Php 300 a day on three meals and two light snacks, consisting of vegetables, quinoa, brown rice, oats, Shirataki rice, fruits, seafood, some red meat, nut, seed, eggs, yogurt, cheese, nut milk, herbs, spices, and other important cooking ingredients. Restaurant foods are expensive and usually contain more ingredients that can cause bloating and weight gain.

These lifestyle practices can improve gut health and reduce bloating,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/426751/these-lifestyle-practices-can-improve-gut-health-and-reduce-bloating/,"06:29 PM September 02, 2022","Gut problems, hormonal imbalance (Premenstrual syndrome, peri-menopause, menopause, and postmenopause), sedentary lifestyle, stress, poor diet, and other health issues can cause bloating or abdominal distension (accumulation of gas and fluid in the abdominal area).  Mild to serious cases can be managed by practicing healthy these effective lifestyle habits. Ensure proper hydration Proper hydration should always be a part of your lifestyle checklist. Having the right amount and quality of fluid in your body can improve your energy level and overall health. Dehydration can interfere with your daily functioning – you can get headaches, feel weak, find it hard to mentally focus on tasks, and can also lead to bloating due to constipation and hormonal imbalance. If your urine is light and clear, that means you are well-hydrated. You need to drink more water if your urine is dark. Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day to make sure that the cells and organs in your body are working correctly. You need more water if you move more (and sweat more), if the weather is hot if you are adding more fiber to your diet, and if you drink coffee and alcohol. You can use a water bottle during the day and aim to finish at least 2 liters (8 glasses) of water by the end of the day. To optimize your workout performance, drink a glass of water (8 ounces or 250 ml) 20 to 30 minutes before, 7 to 10 ounces every 10 to 20 minutes during (would depend on the weather and intensity of your workout), and another glass within 30 minutes after your workout. You can regulate your heart rate, and avoid palpitations during an intense workout such as running or cycling by practicing proper hydration. Manage your sodium intake The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people consume less than 2000 mg or 5 grams (less than a tsp) of salt per day to avoid these diseases. High intake of sodium can cause hypertension (high blood pressure) that contributes to stroke and heart failure. If you have high blood pressure, limit sodium intake to less than 1500 mg per day. You can instantly bloat and gain a pound or two from eating Chinese foods and instant noodles with seasonings as a result of water retention. Weight gain from salt is temporary and can be managed by sweating out the excess fluid the next day and resuming healthy eating,  However, too high-sodium and high-fat or high-calorie foods such as sausage, chips, and deep-fried salty foods can increase your body fat weight. Here’s how you can control your daily sodium intake: Observe how your body reacts to certain foods, then manage your eating according to your condition Your body needs the right amount of water and fiber to ensure proper digestion. Consume healthy carbohydrates on a daily basis so you can get the right amount of fiber (20-25 grams for women and up to 38 grams for men) that your body needs to ensure proper digestion. Lack of fiber can lead to gut problems such as constipation, bloating, heart problems, and a low immune system. But having too much fiber without proper hydration can also lead to constipation (that leads to bloating) and diarrhea. That’s why you really need to recognize how your body reacts to excessive consumption of high-fiber foods such as beans, fruits, and vegetables so you can balance your eating. Bloating can easily occur even if you regularly consume healthy foods. This happens if you have allergies or food intolerances.  If you are lactose intolerant, you can experience abdominal bloating due to the increase of water and gas in your digestive system after consuming dairy products such as yogurt, cheese, and milk.  Avoid foods containing gluten (the protein found in grains such as wheat and rye) such as bread, pasta, and cereals if you have celiac disease (gluten sensitivity). You can get gluten-free grains in healthy food stores and supermarkets. Other digestive health issues such as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) that cause abdominal bloating should be addressed by digestive health specialists for complete health management. Aside from practicing proper hydration, active living, and eating healthy foods such as fruits, wholesome grains, and vegetables at the right time, you also need to increase the good bacteria in your body to manage to bloat and improve your gut health on a long-term basis by taking probiotic foods (yogurt, pickles, kimchi) and drinks (kombucha and kefir). Manage your stress Stress can disrupt your balance, and affect your hormones and energy level, which can result in weight gain and abdominal bloating because cortisol, the stress hormone can attract more fat cells in the abdominal area. Manage or prevent stress and daily hassles. Discover what can effectively work well for you -try to get a good quality sleep (7 to 8 hours) meditate, have fun, move more and be with the most positive people that you know.

The dangers of romanticizing mental illness,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/409480/the-dangers-of-romanticizing-mental-illness/,"03:09 PM July 01, 2022","In the past, mental health issues were often stigmatized, but in this day and age, society is transitioning to becoming more and more open-minded. The problem lies on how far people are willing to go to express their acceptance of such. Gen Z has brought about significant awareness of mental health issues, but although these intentions are seemingly ethical, this has created a society that normalizes the romanticization of mental disorders. In a 2020 article for The Statesman, Anya Marquardt wrote that the romanticization of mental health takes place when an individual views a mental disorder to be “glamorous” or even “beautifully painful.” This significantly downplays the severity of mental disorders and instead portrays these to be somewhat desirable. Social media is perhaps the main outlet wherein people can learn about mental health. While this has benefits, such as creating a safe space for those who suffer from mental issues, this also has its disadvantages. Posts on social media can carelessly cover mental illness and sometimes even glorify it. This invalidates the experiences of people who are actually suffering from any such mental conditions and can make them feel isolated or alone. The influence of social media on teenagers can lead to them unknowingly desiring mental illness, which all too often results in false claims of having one. This pertains to associating mental health issues with everyday moods. “People label their sadness as depression and their nervousness as anxiety when the problems that they’re facing often don’t reflect those psychological problems. If healthy people are convinced that they’re depressed, they ultimately identify with the glamorized social media posts, aggravating the phenomenon even more,” says Jinan Jennifer Jadayel, a coauthor of a 2017 study that tracked social media posts about mental health. Simply tweeting phrases like, “I’m depressed” or “I have anxiety” may look harmless but, in fact, this undermines the power that these words hold. People unknowingly self-diagnose themselves with various disorders because they either think it’s the “norm” or because they want to be “edgy” and “cool.” Instead of saying “I’m depressed,” one could say “I’m feeling unhappy.” The difference between these two phrases is that feeling unhappy expresses one’s current state of emotion, which makes it seem like a temporary feeling, while saying “I’m depressed” with no formal psychological diagnosis feels more like a restriction we are putting on ourselves. One does not realize that choosing to follow through with this restriction inevitably leads us into believing that we are something we’re not. Eating disorders are another thing that can be glamorized by media, promoting toxic diet culture that creates an inaccurate portrayal of these dangerous behaviors. In many television shows that are catered toward teenagers, conventionally attractive actresses render eating disorders and weight loss as the path to becoming more beautiful, avoiding the potentially life-threatening reality of the undesirable physical and psychological results of these, such as anemia, hair loss, malnutrition and many more. Perhaps, one of the most accurate representations of this phenomenon was in the British teen series “Skins,” where a glorified portrayal of anorexia was seen in the character Cassie. The show depicted Cassie as someone who used her eating disorder to stay thin, promoting the fallacy that eating disorders make one look more beautiful. Her struggles with anorexia were romanticized, which led to images of Cassie being used for “thinspo” online. In the media that teenagers consume, these dangerous disorders are indirectly promoted through the exclusion of the detrimental health risks that come with them. Another flawed representation of having a mental health condition is in the series “13 Reasons Why,” which fails to accurately depict suicide and depression. In the show, the main character dies by suicide after leaving 13 tapes that targeted each person whom she believes caused her death. This fabricates a narrative that she was able to get revenge on her bullies and gain control over her life only after her death. This could be harmful to a young and impressionable audience as they may view suicide as a gateway to solving their problems. There is nothing wrong with finding beauty in your sadness, depression, or pain. These can serve as inspiration for art and even literature. The issue at hand is that the aesthetic takes away the importance of the underlying issues that surround these. It omits the raw struggles that people face and downplays them to a romanticizing theme that manipulates people into thinking that this is reality. While it is important to break the stigma surrounding mental health issues, as a society it is also important to put a stop to its romanticization. —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Maxene Magalona discovers a book about healthy boundaries,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/409164/maxene-magalona-discovers-a-book-about-healthy-boundaries/,"03:38 PM June 26, 2022","Actress and yoga teacher Maxene Magalona is done reading a book which in essence spoke about having healthy boundaries. Magalona talked about the benefits of reading the book “Set Boundaries Find Peace” as can be seen in her Instagram page today, June 26, where she also showed the book, and herself having a beverage. She quoted the book: “Boundaries are expectations and needs that help you feel safe and comfortable in your relationships. Expectations in relationships help you stay mentally and emotionally well. Learning when to say no and when to say yes is also an essential part of feeling comfortable when interacting with others.” Magalona believes the book will help her “strengthen my relationship with myself as it is all about learning how to set healthy boundaries—a term which I had never heard of until just a couple of years ago.” “Since I used to be a chronic people pleaser, I never knew that I could actually say no to the things that were not in alignment with my truth. I used to just say yes to everyone and everything around me due to fear of being rejected or disliked,” she explained. Aware that this is not being taught in schools, Magalona feels it is “definitely worth learning because it will help us maintain our mental and emotional well-being.” “Having healthy boundaries will allow us the space and freedom to be who we really are in our relationships. There will be no need to pretend and please others,” she said. “The desire to be liked and validated by everyone around us comes from the ego.”   A post shared by Maxene Magalona (@maxenemagalona)  Magalona feels that “knowing ourselves authentically and feeling inwardly secure in God’s love are the effects of connecting to our soul.” She learned that not all will align “with the truth of who we are” and that “we can gently release it and move towards the things that add value to our lives.” With this, she just let go of everything that brings her down and drains her energy and decided to “invest my time in what truly serves and uplifts me.” “Souls who have healthy boundaries are those who have a strong sense of self-love and self-respect because we know our worth and will not allow anyone or anything to make us feel less than who we truly are,” she stressed.

Keep on going no matter what – Don’t let anything ruin your health goals,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/402939/keep-on-going-no-matter-what-dont-let-anything-ruin-your-health-goals/,"12:28 PM May 12, 2022","You might be feeling emotionally or physically down like there’s no motivation to do anything like sleeping late, spending more time now with social media or watching movies at night, losing that drive to exercise and using food to temporarily make you feel good. However, reverting to unhealthy habits will just worsen the situation. No matter what the causes are and how overwhelming your feelings may be, you should tell yourself that you can always surpass this challenge and move on with your life. Soon enough, everything will be okay again.  Focus on the things that you have control over. Do your best to stay physically, mentally, spiritually, and emotionally healthy so you can positively influence and give more to others while being a good role model.  It’s hard to give if you are emotionally and physically drained. It all starts from within.  But how can you really motivate yourself to keep going?  Manage your time and be productive Spending too much time internalizing negativity around you won’t do any good for your mental and physical health because it can seriously affect your sleep, drive to move and exercise. If you can devote two hours of your time to combined social media and watching a TV series, you can definitely spare two hours of your time for more productive activities that can make you feel better. Fill your unproductive hours with activities that can motivate you to make your goals and dreams happen.   Recognize and resolve emotional eating Be aware of how you are reacting to unfavorable issues – how your problems are affecting you physically and emotionally. Feeling stressed and discouraged about unexpected circumstances that just happened to you can trigger emotional eating, which can lead to health issues. This is when you resort to calorie-rich foods (cookies, cakes, pizza, chips, pastries) for comfort so you can temporarily suppress negative emotions such as anger, sadness, fear, boredom, and stress. Do not let your negative feelings pull you down. There are effective ways how to deal with this.   Battle laziness Laziness can increase your sluggishness. Exercise can give you that positive energy you’ve always wanted to have because of the desired positive feelings from the endorphins and knowing that you are doing something good for yourself. But how do you start moving if you are feeling really down right now? Just to move and you will feel definitely better after. Here are some ways on how to make it happen.  -No time and busy? If you can make time to lie down and watch, you can also spend 30 minutes moving. – Tired today? You will always get tired if you don’t start moving now. You can spend 30 minutes walking, make it fun by being with someone, or calling a friend while you walk. -Feeling bad? You’ll feel worse if you don’t start doing something good for your health today  Experience your blessings You have the greatest opportunity to do something great right now because you are in control of your life. Recognize your strengths and contemplate them. A failure or a negative feeling is just a small part of the bigger positive picture. It is time to count and fully experience your blessings.

6 Guilt-free activities that will let you experience all the fun—without compromising your health,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/398329/6-guilt-free-activities-that-will-let-you-experience-all-the-fun-without-compromising-your-health/,"03:00 PM March 25, 2022","It’s easy to get bored these days, especially since a lot of us still exercise precaution about being up and about outside. For a lot of adults, fun activities may mean doing some of the most extreme things, but that’s not always the case. There are a wide range of boredom busters that can proactively fill your time with activities that meaningful, fun, and can even strengthen your bonds with people who matter. Biking  This activity is popular among all ages–It’s a low-impact workout, which allows you to unwind and reflect on your day while protecting you from obesity, and other chronic illnesses. You can do it alone, with a friend, or even with the whole family. If you care for your mental health, biking helps release chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine (the so-called happy hormones) which will leave you feeling good each time. Collecting as a hobby  If you think collecting things is kind of boring, think again. A lot of collectors find thrill in seeking, locating, organizing, cataloging, and displaying anything that sparks their interest.  There are people who collect watches, dolls, vinyl records, antiques, and even artworks. For fun, other people collect mugs, postcards, magnets, and other vacation memorabilia. The possibilities are endless, and all you must do is to find out what you really like to start with then ask family and friends to help you out. Note that these could cost you (some) money, but if it makes you happy then why not, right? Experimenting in the kitchen  Cooking is a must-have skill for everyone, and there’s nothing wrong with wanting to try out different food and recipes even in the comfort of your own home. Just whip out your utensils, some ingredients, a laptop/tablet where you can follow recipe videos, and you’re good to go! You can even crack a cold beer after cooking your meal, or even while you’re at it! Just remember to drink in moderation since you’re still cooking. Playing online games or having game night with friends  Gaming is not just for the young ones! Studies have shown that playing (in general, not just video games) is said to improve the mental health of adults, so why not start that, right? You can go for a chill simulation or role-playing video game or a simple word quiz or crossword puzzle app that can be installed on your mobile phone. Maybe even hold a game night with your friends, or gather your family and have board games ready and get everyone to relive the days when things were easier and the world felt like an oyster. Don’t forget the food and beverages for your game night, and sometimes, beer just feels like the best choice for these kinds of things. Binge-watching your comfort TV series or anything you want  Staying up late may not be for you these days but let yourself chill out for just a day or two and binge watch anything you want. These could be a sitcom you’ve always loved, or a movie franchise you’ve always enjoyed watching, or even an anime or K-Drama you’ve been missing out on. Pair your binge-watching mood with your comfort snack and maybe even a nice, cold bottle of beer. It will be a good way to unwind from a crazy week. Hold a party or go dance the night away outside while keeping distance  Partying never gets old and it’s a certainly ageless way to have fun! Dress up in your party clothes, meet up with friends, and go dance the night away (safely, okay?) Do it in your garden, roof deck, lanai, or any open-air area in the house where there is a lot of space to breathe. You don’t need to have anything to celebrate to have a party, you just need to have fun while you’re at it! While your friends bring their own potluck entry, prep the grill to start a fun BBQ party.  Of course, no party is complete without fizzy drinks or alcohol! Grab a bottle, or maybe two, then just let loose. Just remember to drink responsibly. All these things can be done with or without any alcohol, but you know things are twice as fun when you’re merry-drinking! Good thing that San Miguel Brewery has introduced the San Mig Zero, a refreshing beer that has the lowest carbs and calories vs all local beers, with zero sugar, allowing you to live life guilt-free. It’s the perfect excuse to have drinking sessions with friends and family. With low carb, calorie, and zero sugar content, it’s all fun and no worries in every bottle! Don’t let boredom bring you down. Have a little fun and let yourself live in the moment because life is good! Drink Responsibly ASC Ref No. S157P032322SS INQUIRER.net BrandRoom/GP/JC ADVT.

I’ve witnessed how most people struggled with their health, weight issues, and difficulties facing sudden and drastic changes. It was seen in their schedule, home environment, school, work, and relationships. It takes a lot of acceptance, patience, hard work, commitment, openness, and discipline to survive. I asked some of my clients to inspire and share their lifestyle and fitness achievements, how they conquered all the challenges, and how they still maintain their strong determination and motivation to stay fit and healthy. Juana Yupangco, 38, Founder, Mesa ni Misis  I started training Juana 14 years ago, just a couple of months after giving birth to her first-born child, Jaime. We immediately started our online Zoom workout sessions during the first week of the pandemic in March 2020. She has never stopped her active and healthy lifestyle since then. That’s why she continued her workouts even during the pandemic. Her passion and commitment to healthy living led her to achieve her best body and health ever while influencing her whole family and everyone, especially since she started her Mesa ni Misis project a few years ago. Share something about your lifestyle transformation and fitness achievements for the past two years. How did you do it?
I lost the stubborn weight I had after having my kids. I walk every day for at least 30 minutes and focus on my eating habits. What difficulties did you encounter? How were you able to conquer the challenges brought about by this pandemic?
I decided that I would take advantage of not having to go out during the pandemic. I focused on very healthy eating and developing healthy workout habits. Please share the most powerful lifestyle lessons and realizations you had from this pandemic.
A diet high in veggies is the way to go. Cutting down on meat is the key to keeping my weight down and feeling good mentally and emotionally. I also follow the personalized health and epigenetics program (PH360) of Mitch and Armand Mendoza. Mitch taught me to optimize my fruit and veggie intake, and it works to help me feel my best. I see Armand for personalized workouts for strengthening, lengthening, and toning my whole body, which works best for my body type. Luisa Viray, 48, Homemaker and Business Owner  Luisa started joining my morning Zoom class last July 2020. Her strong determination to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle despite her treatments and surgeries is truly inspiring. She’s consistent and committed when it comes to exercising. Share something about your lifestyle transformation and fitness achievements for the past two years. How did you do it?
I was diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2019 and finished treatment in March 2021. As soon as I regained my strength, I started doing light workouts on YouTube. I then joined Mitch’s classes. I’ve recently incorporated weight training and physical therapy to round out my fitness routine. What difficulties did you encounter? How were you able to conquer the challenges brought about by this pandemic?
Cancer treatment and multiple surgeries took a huge toll on my body. I learned to be patient with it. I took a holistic approach to wellness and sought help to heal physically, mentally, and spiritually. The pandemic also taught me that I don’t need to go to the gym to stay healthy and fit. Please share the most powerful lifestyle lessons and realizations you had from this pandemic.
Health is wealth! Listen to your body and avoid all things toxic–certain people, food, and situations. Don’t wait to get sick before you start taking better care of yourself. Giselle Eduque, 45, Homemaker  Giselle experienced the biggest challenges in her life during the pandemic. I’ve seen how she significantly transformed her way of thinking to achieve her health and fitness goals. We started our lifestyle coaching sessions two years ago. Share something about your lifestyle transformation and fitness achievements for the past two years. How did you do it?
I was able to control my self-sabotaging attitude by being kinder to myself and leaning towards self-love. I achieved it by being more mindful about how I live my life, prioritizing my health, feeding my body and soul with quality over quantity, and having a positive outlook, good mindset, and a completely different perspective of most situations. It’s all about meditation, keeping a journal, maintaining an attitude of gratitude, eating mindfully, without feeling guilty, knowing when to have cheat days and when to push it. Exercising to keep stress levels down kept me motivated and moved towards looking for that consistency. Keeping a good sleep routine and never forgetting to laugh and have fun even during scary and unprecedented times. What difficulties did you encounter? How were you able to conquer the challenges brought about by this pandemic?
My biggest challenge was maneuvering around my father’s illness until his passing in the time of COVID-19. I conquered the challenges by having the undying support from my husband and girls, knowing I had my family’s trust and that we all had each other’s backs. The outpouring of love and support from my friends, constant prayers, and small acts of kindness and gestures from everyone surrounding me. Mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical fitness. All of that came into play! Please share the most powerful lifestyle lessons and realizations you had from this pandemic.
Don’t be so hard on yourself. Learn to ask for help when you need it, give back when you can, continue to be a better version of yourself by taking the first step. Every day towards a goal is one step closer to where you need to be. Macel Fernandez-Estavillo, 50, General Counsel and SVP, JG Summit Holdings, Inc.  I started seeing Macel and her kids for online workouts last October 2020. I admire Macel for being a dedicated mother who encouraged her daughters to workout with her. At the same time, she practices healthy eating. Share something about your lifestyle transformation and fitness achievements for the past two years. How did you do it?
I’ve always had an active and balanced lifestyle. I exercise five to six times a week by running 6km each day on my treadmill, and I do online boxing and Pilates twice a week with Mitch. I do my best to watch what I eat, and I am mindful of my portions. I also aim to become stronger. During the pandemic, my best fitness achievement is getting my daughters to exercise regularly with me. I saw how they got stronger and ran faster throughout the pandemic. Online fitness classes were much easier to schedule: We didn’t have to contend with traffic. My husband also wakes up early to run each day. We set up one room in our house as a gym so that the whole family could get active. What difficulties did you encounter? How were you able to conquer the challenges brought about by this pandemic?
The pandemic blurred the lines between work and home, so it was hard to manage my fitness schedule since  I could have work meetings in the evenings. Other challenges included maintaining a regular fitness schedule while traveling, when getting sick or vaccinated, or when I just felt lazy. There will be days when exercise is not possible. I learned that you have to be flexible and not make too many excuses. I also wear a Fitbit, so I am constantly reminded to get more steps in. Please share the most powerful lifestyle lessons and realizations you had from this pandemic.
Healthy living is a lifestyle choice, not just for myself but also for my family. For years, I have told my husband that he and I needed to eat healthily and exercise regularly to have many more healthy years together. Now that our daughters are growing up, I am happy to see them embracing a healthy lifestyle too. A healthy lifestyle does not only make you physically strong but also improves your mental and spiritual well-being. Sonny Angara, 49, Senator and Tootsy Angara, 46, Cluster Head for Sales, ABS-CBN  I started training Tootsy at home 13 years ago. We didn’t stop our workouts ever since, except when she got pregnant with her youngest, Javier. Eventually, Sonny joined her with some of our face-to-face sessions, and even today, they are still very consistent with our workouts. Through the years, I’ve seen how they transformed their lifestyle and how they make healthy living a family affair. Share something about your lifestyle transformation and fitness achievements for the past two years. How did you do it as a couple?
We’ve been regularly exercising together with Mitch, combined with a personalized health and nutrition program (PH360) with Armand Mendoza. We go to bed earlier now and make sure that we get enough sleep. We also keep a positive outlook in life and focus on feeling blessed every day. What difficulties did you encounter? How were you able to conquer the challenges brought about by this pandemic?
Not being able to workout that much, like playing basketball (Sonny) regularly and the temptation to eat more by being at home more often now than before. We conquered it with our willpower and discipline by exercising consistently (at least three times a week) and finding healthier food replacements (shirataki rice, almond bread, avocado oil) for the “bad stuff” (chips, sweets, processed foods) Please share the most powerful lifestyle lessons and realizations you had from this pandemic.
When you’re younger, you can get away with a bad diet [if you] exercise, but as you get older, it’s equally important. 
Working out together is so much more fun! It’s much easier to achieve your fitness goals when you’re doing it together. Gianina Dayrit, 49, Businesswoman Gianina started joining my Zoom classes last September 2020. She’s one of my most consistent and motivated students. I always see her positive drive and eagerness to workout, even if we are just online. She’s always concerned about eating healthy, staying consistent with workouts, and avoiding injuries to get her desired fitness results. Share something about your lifestyle transformation and fitness achievements for the past two years. How did you do it?
I am happy to have found Mitch in 2020. My biggest lifestyle transformation was getting up almost every day to workout and sticking to the program. I found something I enjoy doing and haven’t missed a week since I started. What difficulties did you encounter? How were you able to conquer the challenges brought about by this pandemic?
It is challenging to stay active when you are stuck at home. You don’t move as much, and you are more sedentary. I have been used to doing my 10,000 steps daily, but I wasn’t moving as much in the pandemic. Thank God for Zoom classes. They kept me going. I also discovered all these yummy desserts in lockdown. That was a major challenge to say no to, so I focused on potion control. Please share the most powerful lifestyle lessons and realizations you had from this pandemic.
Find something you love doing, so you stick to it. Also, rest when your body tells you to. Tinky Locsin, 46, Travel Designer  Before the pandemic started, Tinky used to join my small group Pilates, strength, cardio, and core classes in B+B Studio. When the pandemic started, she asked me to see her twice a week at 6:15 am, and until now, she remains consistent with our schedule. I always get inspired by her discipline and motivation to wake up early in the morning, either to see me online or to workout on her own. Share something about your lifestyle transformation and fitness achievements for the past two years. How did you do it?
Healthy lifestyle habits like working out every day, reading food labels more often, voiding too much snacking, and eating a lot of vegetables and healthy grains, but still indulging in fun food! What difficulties did you encounter? How were you able to conquer the challenges brought about by this pandemic?
Not being able to go outside during strict lockdown. So I did online workout sessions with Mitch twice a week, used various workout apps for HIIT training and mind-body exercises, and used the stairs in our condo. Right now, I incorporate brisk walking, swimming, and yoga in my weekly exercise routine. Please share the most powerful lifestyle lessons and realizations you had from this pandemic.
Read food labels! Workout and stay active every day, even if it’s just 30 minutes. Every day is a new day. Cristina R. Caguioa, 49, Medical Doctor  I do a combined lifestyle coaching and personal training session with Tina once a week since the start of the pandemic. I also see her three times a week during my morning online Zoom classes. She’s very consistent with exercise, and she makes time and effort to prepare her healthy foods even if she’s back to seeing her patients face to face now. Until now, she’s still maintaining her healthy lifestyle habits and weight management result. Share something about your lifestyle transformation and fitness achievements for the past two years. How did you do it?
I lost 20 pounds and six inches off my waistline and sustain the results so far. Now, I can easily climb up and down the stairs without feeling fatigued. I reached my goal through healthy eating ( green smoothies, more seafood, and vegetables), avoiding stress from work (work from home), and sleeping at least eight hours a day. I still manage to do cardio and strength training at least three times a week and twice a week of Pilates and swimming. What difficulties did you encounter? How were you able to conquer the challenges brought about by this pandemic?
I find it difficult to lose/maintain weight and gain muscles at this age. I have to focus more on improving my eating habits and cutting down on alcohol and sweets. I have to be consistent with my workouts. It should always be a cardio, core, and strength training variation. Please share the most powerful lifestyle lessons and realizations you had from this pandemic.
There are no shortcuts to reaching your goals. It should always be a good balance of healthy diet and exercise plus a positive mindset. Ana Gloria, 48, Writer  I’ve known Ana for almost two decades now, and she’s always there to join my classes wherever I go. Her contagious energy and passion for fun and challenging workouts always drive me to push myself more during my group classes (face-to-face and online). The pandemic didn’t stop her from exercising. She can work out on her own when I don’t see her, and she will always find ways to move even she’s on vacation. Share something about your lifestyle transformation and fitness achievements for the past two years. How did you do it?
I was able to exercise continuously for the past two years by keeping a regular fitness schedule and showing up religiously when it was time to exercise. What difficulties did you encounter? How were you able to conquer the challenges brought about by this pandemic?
It was challenging to get up, be active, and work out when it was so much easier to take it easy. I overcame the lazy urges by not giving it too much thought and just showing up! Please share the most powerful lifestyle lessons and realizations you had from this pandemic.
Healthy living is a mindset and a conscious choice. Claudia Tambunting, 54, President, BISMAC  I’ve been training Claudia three times a week for almost 12 years. She’s one of my most obedient, fun, and consistent students. I always look forward to our sessions because we discuss everything under the sun, even while exercising (face-to-face or online). She will always make time to see me via Zoom to adjust her schedule even when she’s out of the country with a different time zone. Share something about your lifestyle transformation and fitness achievements for the past two years. How did you do it?
I managed my weight and workout consistently three times a week for the past two years. I realized that Zoom could be a very efficient way of exercising because there’s no need to drive to a gym. I do miss face to face with Mitch, but we still manage to chat when I am doing less vigorous exercise. I also have seen a stricter Mitch who pushes me to achieve more, and I appreciate that! I enjoy our sessions and make it a point not to be absent. I feel stronger as a result and appreciate her dedication. I sometimes hear her in my head when I’m eating but manage to put her on mute sometimes. What difficulties did you encounter? How were you able to conquer the challenges brought about by this pandemic?
I found the pandemic in The Philippines was very stifling. We were even banned from walking our dogs in the street. Runners, bikers, and walkers had to exercise outdoor with masks on whether or not there were people nearby. But exercise sessions with Mitch became my hour of the day to look forward to despite the pandemic restrictions. Please share the most powerful lifestyle lessons and realizations you had from this pandemic.
Life goes on even in a pandemic, and we adapt by finding “other” ways to make a new normal. Lizzie Eder Zobel, 56, Chairman, Teach for the Philippines  Lizzie does cardio, strength, and core workouts with me two to three times a week (alone or with her friend) since July 2020. The pandemic didn’t stop her from moving. I am always inspired by her strong and lean body, positive vibe, and strong determination always to stay healthy. Share something about your lifestyle transformation and fitness achievements for the past two years. How did you do it?
Exercising every day, which I did not do before! Now, I join my friend, Cara, with her morning workouts with Mitch twice a week, Pilates twice a week, functional movement sessions twice a week, and walking for my cardio on most days of the week and when I am away. What difficulties did you encounter? How were you able to conquer the challenges brought about by this pandemic?
Isolation became a very big challenge for a lot of people— especially the young and elderly. I relied on my husband, kids, and friends to navigate the confusion we all felt initially as we were all trying to figure out how to keep safe and healthy. My biggest challenge was getting reliable and relevant information that would help me follow the health safety protocols.

"‘To free yourself from mental afflictions, you have to study your mind’",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/398527/to-free-yourself-from-mental-afflictions-you-have-to-study-your-mind/,"05:25 PM March 13, 2022","  KATHMANDU — Born in the remote village of Samagaun in Gorkha, Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche is one of the most globally renowned meditation teachers of his generation. His first book, ‘The Joy of Living’, was listed on The New York Times’ best-seller list and has been translated into over 20 languages. He has since gone on to author six more books. Recently, Mingyur Rinpoche launched ‘Jiunuko Majja’, a Nepali translation of his widely acclaimed book ‘The Joy of Living’. Rinpoche first started practising meditation when he was nine, and at the age of 13, he went to India to study Tibetan Buddhism. He now heads the Kathmandu-based Tergar Osel Ling Monastery and has spent the last 30 years teaching Buddhism and meditation in not just Nepal but all over the world. In this interview with the Post’s Tsering Ngodup Lama, Mingyur Rinpoche talked about the growing interest in meditation among Nepalis and how this made him launch ‘Jiunuko Majja’, the importance of practising meditation in today’s world, and why he has been so vocal about the impact of climate change and food insecurity in his home village. Excerpts. I was seven or eight years old when I started experiencing panic attacks. I was too young to understand what panic attacks were. When I started practising meditation at the age of nine, I found myself better equipped to understand and deal with my panic attacks. ‘The Joy of Living’ is about how meditation has benefitted me throughout my life and the many discussions I have had over the years on the interconnectedness between Buddhism and modern science. A few years ago, someone translated ‘The Joy of Living’ into Nepali, but many told me that the jargon in the book made it very difficult for them to read it. In the last few years, I have seen a growing interest among both Buddhists and non-Buddhists to learn Buddhism and meditation, and this is why we decided to translate the book into Nepali once again and came up with ‘Jiunuko Maja’. This is a positive development and something the current world desperately needs. So many people have lost their loved ones to the pandemic, which has also caused so much economic uncertainty. In these uncertain times, being more aware of one’s emotions and thoughts helps a lot. For over 2,000 years, many people have relied on the meditation techniques taught by Buddha to train themselves to become more aware of their thoughts and emotions. Even though the techniques might have been developed centuries ago, they are still relevant today, and in the 30 years that I have taught meditation, I have seen people who practise meditation diligently transform themselves. What is essential for people to understand is that qualities like awareness, love, and compassion are innate in us. But our minds are so used to being cluttered with self-centric and egoistic thoughts that these noble qualities get obscured. Meditation allows us to become more in touch with these qualities. When I was a boy, we could reach glaciers by walking just two hours from our village. But we now have to walk eight hours from our village to reach the nearest glacier. Places that once used to be covered with snow year-round are just barren rocks. Another concern is the unpredictable weather, which has become a norm in our village. We now get snowfall in the spring, something underheard of when I was growing up. We are seeing long dry spells during months when we should be getting rainfall. This year we received unprecedented heavy rain, and this destroyed many crops. Due to the heavy downpour, people couldn’t also harvest yarsagumba [ophiocordyceps sinensis], which is one of the primary sources of cash income for our people, in the quantity they once did. The erratic weather pattern has also made it difficult for farmers in our village. Natural disasters are also becoming more common. This year we saw the first flooding in our village in 30 years. Another issue that we have witnessed in our village is deforestation. Since 2008, 35 percent of native forests around Samagaun have been deforested. To re-green the barren land, we have been helping a local project that has already planted 30,000 pine trees. Our organisation, Tergar Charity Nepal, has planted 1,000 goji berry plants on deforested lands. Goji berries are highly nutritious fruit and are also native to the region. This plantation project will help re-green barren land and provide villagers with an additional source of income. If things go well, we will be planting 50,000 to 100,000 goji berry plants. Our village’s topography and climatic conditions are not ideal for farming. This is why most of what our villagers eat daily are sourced from the nearest town, which is almost six to seven days’ walk away. A vegetable costing Rs 100 kg in the town costs Rs 700 to Rs 800 by the time they get to our village. In 2020, when Nepal went into lockdown, it disrupted our village’s food supply chain and people suddenly no longer had access to many food items. This made us realise the importance of food security and lessening our dependence on external food supply. That very year, Tergar Charity Nepal selected the 15 most economically vulnerable families in our village and built greenhouses for them to grow vegetables and herbs. This project has been an enormous success. These families are now growing cabbage, cauliflower, spinach, carrot, tomato, cucumber, watermelon for ten months of the year. Without greenhouses, people could only grow radish and potato, and that too for only five months a year. Villagers are now also selling vegetables, fruits, and herbs to restaurants and guesthouses in the area and making extra income. We plan to set up 30 more greenhouses for families in the village. Families from neighbouring villages have also approached us to help them build greenhouses, and we will be doing that as well. Compared to the past, more Nepalis have become interested in meditation, and it is this very growing interest that made me launch ‘Jiunuko Majja’. But we have to understand that as human beings, most of us tend to focus on self-exploration only when our other needs are met. The majority of Nepalis within the country are focused on fulfilling their basic needs, which is necessary and understandable. But unlike other countries, Nepal is the birthplace of Buddha and home to this ancient knowledge of meditation, and I think that if our people can adopt it in their daily lives, it will be immensely beneficial for all. See, if you want to become a doctor, you have to go to a medical school and learn anatomy, physiology, and a host of other things. But if you want to free yourself from your mental afflictions, you have to study your mind and its workings.

Here’s why the gift of health is the best gift for the holiday season,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391530/heres-why-the-gift-of-health-is-the-best-gift-for-the-holiday-season/,"04:08 PM November 18, 2021","Check on your friends or family. This has been a reminder that takes special meaning in our not-so-normal circumstances. With a pandemic that causes enormous uncertainty and plays with people’s minds, making them feel isolated or fearful, a check-up call from someone can make a major difference to anyone’s day. Whether it’s a virtual call, a text, or a comment on one’s timeline, there’s something definitely uplifting when someone checks in on you. Taking this check-in one step further, you can send gifts or essentials to show you care. Given the restrictions on mobility these days, receiving something from a friend is especially appreciated. Living in isolation for close to 2 years might have robbed us of our motivation to move forward, and a little nudge from someone could be all it takes to get us going. As we approach the second festive season in quarantine, Puritan’s Pride encourages us to inspire those in our circles or communities to do the same.  More importantly, it aims to inspire people and refresh people’s mindsets so they can think healthy. With the Christmas season fast approaching, Puritan’s Pride encourages everyone to give the gift of health by sending loved ones their well-thought out bundles, which are all available at Lazada and Shopee. These bundles demonstrate its efforts to promote a healthier Philippines, paying attention to people’s physical, mental, and emotional health.  In these stressful times, Puritan’s Pride’s Immunity Pack is the perfect way to check in on loved ones and encourage them to stay in good shape. This bundle includes Vitamin C-500 mg with Bioflavonoids & Rose Hips, Vitamin D3 400 IU, and Zinc Gluconate Chelated 25mg. Vitamin C strengthens the immune function, while bioflavonoids and rose hips have skin anti-aging properties. Vitamin D3, a commonly missed vitamin, supports bone health and is essential for optimal health.  Zinc, meanwhile, fights bacteria and viruses and assists in the proper functioning of insulin, while promoting healthy skin, vision, and smell.  Available at Lazada on 11.11 for 23% off, the Immunity Pack comes with a free tote bag for the first 270 customers who will purchase. Equally compelling are the Immunity Pack A and Melatonin, available through Shopee on 11.11 for 17% off and 30% off respectively. The Immunity Pack A offers all the health benefits of Vitamin C-500 mg with Bioflavonoids & Rose Hips and Zinc Gluconate Chelated 25mg, while Melatonin helps regulate sleep and protects the body by strengthening immunity through T-cells, a special kind of white blood cells.

With Puritan’s Pride, checking in on loved ones has become much easier, more affordable, and more convenient to do. ADVT  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"McDonald’s leads in environmentally sustainable restaurants, opens its second in Mandaluyong",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391336/going-green-and-good-mcdonalds-opens-newest-sustainable-store/,"02:59 PM November 16, 2021"," MANDALUYONG CITY, PHILIPPINES — In time for Environmental Awareness Month, McDonald’s Philippines reinforces its commitment towards using environment-conscious and climate-friendly restaurant solutions as it opens its newest Green & Good store in Shaw Boulevard Wack Wack, Mandaluyong City. McDonald’s Green & Good stores allow the QSR giant to test and learn sustainable practices with its green building construction and utility efficient solutions. The first Green & Good store was launched in UN Del Pilar Avenue in Manila City in April 2021.  The Green & Good store in Shaw Boulevard Wack Wack is the first McDonald’s store in the country to adapt a modular system with its prefabricated prefinished building construction. Compared to a traditional brick-and-block approach, each module is produced off-site and installed together with other modules on-site. This enables faster work in a controlled environment and promotes sustainability through reduced waste and impact of on-site construction activities. The store was also built with repurposed and recycled material such as reclaimed wood, eco- pavers, and eco-bricks. Concrete fiber was used as an alternative material to steel rebars on slabs, pavements, and driveways. Even smaller details such as paint used made with low volatile organic compounds were prioritized with less environmental impact. The Green & Good store also includes solar lampposts and photo and motion sensors as part of its utility efficiency solutions, as well as eco-friendly air conditioning for less energy consumption. Rainwater is also collected in a harvesting tank to be used for cleaning the store’s exterior. “We are committed to provide a better and more environmentally sustainable McDonald’s for our customers and the communities we are a part of. We recognize that there is a lot more to be done but through our Green and Good platform, we are a step closer towards finding innovative ways to keep waste out of nature and drive climate action.” said McDonald’s Philippines President & CEO Kenneth S. Yang. With the growing community of cyclists, the new store includes a Bike & Dine area where cyclists can comfortably enjoy their McDonald’s favorites without having to worry about the safety of their bicycles. The store also has a Bike Repair Station that has the tools cyclists would need to carry out basic bike repair or maintenance.  McDonald’s also partnered with Meralco to provide access to e-charging stations. The Green & Good store in Shaw Wack-Wack is the second store to provide their customers with Meralco E-Sakay’s e-Charging stations for e-bikes and e-scooters. Customers can simply plug-in their e-bike and e-scooter for a minimal fee of PhP1 for one-minute worth of charging.  Customers can also enjoy their food with the use of reusable packaging for dine-in such as reusable rice bowls, utensils, cups, and wooden stirrers. Stricter implementation of solid waste segregation in the dine-in, kitchen and prep areas will be in place. McDonald’s Philippines aims to significantly reduce waste at sanitary landfill by conversion of paper waste to fuel, food waste to fertilizers and plastic waste to repurposed goods, as well as conversion of Vegetable Oil to biodiesel.  McDonald’s Shaw Boulevard Wack Wack is now open for 24 hours to serve customers via dine-in, take-out, ride-thru and McDelivery. Under its M Safe program, McDonald’s ensures the safety of its employees with close to 100% of its crew and managers in NCR now fully vaccinated. Along with the constant acquisition of Safety Seal Certifications, now in more than 60% of all restaurants nationwide, the QSR giant assured that they will continue to offer safe, feel-good experiences for customers whether through Dine-in, Ride-Thru, or Delivery, through crew and managers who are protected/healthy and working in a safe environment.

Your 24-hour healthy lifestyle survival guide,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/390568/your-24-hour-healthy-lifestyle-survival-guide/,"04:50 PM November 01, 2021","Two more months before we enter a brand new year. The biggest motivation you can think of right now is your well-being, with what’s happening in the world. Prepare your mind and body by trying healthy habits that will lead you to a healthy life. Don’t wait for January to restart your healthy lifestyle goals. You need to effectively distribute your energy throughout the day so you can still enjoy your simple rewards in the evening after a hard day’s work. Your overall daily productivity is the result of your mindset, passion, and physical energy. Staying fit and healthy (mentally, emotionally, and physically) is very important to help you conquer the day while pursuing your purpose in life. This 24-hour healthy lifestyle guide can help you survive and face each day with enthusiasm and vibrance. You can constantly adjust the time based on your daily tasks, errands, and work schedule. Try your best to wake up early.  Avoid hitting the snooze button. Instead of checking your phone, sit down, open your eyes, and allow five to 10 minutes of morning prayers and meditation. Give some gratitude for embracing a brand new day that will give you another opportunity to perform better in your life as you learn from your yesterday’s mistakes. Set aside 30 to 60 minutes for morning rituals that can empower you to stay loving, productive, and healthy throughout the day. It can include your self-care morning routine, tidying your bedroom, organizing your home office while checking your schedule, preparing your kitchen while brewing your coffee, and setting up your exercise room. Giving enough time for your morning routine can save you from possible unnecessary daily hassles. Devote 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity in the morning. Exercising in the morning can positively affect your mood and motivate you to eat well and stay healthy throughout the day. If you are an early bird, you can already engage in moderate to high-intensity exercises like running, circuit training, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and other sports like cycling, swimming, and tennis.  If you are a night owl, it is better to do light to moderate exercises in the morning like brisk walking, mind and body exercises like yoga pilates, tai-chi, easy dancing, and lightweight training. Eat your breakfast 15 to 45 minutes after your workout. The amount of food would depend on your exercise duration and intensity.  A quick breakfast after a light workout can be a piece of toast with one tablespoon tbsp of nut butter or egg (boiled, poached, or scrambled) or rolled oats with a handful of nuts (walnuts, almonds, or cashew nuts) and a piece of fruit. You can have a hearty meal like half a cup of brown rice with vegetable omelet and sardines or an egg and cheese sandwich with a piece of fruit or a fruit and vegetable shake after moderate to intense exercises. You need to have a post-workout meal to achieve muscle recovery and avoid intense hunger pangs at lunchtime. Go to your office or work at home while feeling alert and energetic. Try your best to stand up and move every 15 to 20 minutes by stretching, walking around, or doing 20 repetitions of chair squats or chair knee tucks. If you get hungry Two to three hours after breakfast, grab a healthy light snack like a piece of apple or a serving (30 grams) of trail mix (mixed nuts, seeds, and dried fruits) or a yogurt. The morning snack is also substantial if your workout time is at noon. If you stay at home, you can devote 20 to 30 minutes to food preparation: Cook simple, delicious and healthy dishes. Eat a packed lunch consisting of healthy grains like brown rice or whole-wheat pasta, or quinoa with cooked vegetables and your choice of healthy protein like seafood, chicken, or lean meat. You can also have a chicken or fish sandwich with salad on the side. Always avoid deep-fried foods. Limit the food sauces and salad dressing to 1tbsp, especially if you are trying to manage your weight. Always drink enough water and avoid extra calories and sugar from drinks like sodas, milk teas, or sweet juices. You can go back to work and continue to insert movements to keep you awake and alert with your tasks. Avoid caffeinated drinks in the afternoon, at least six hours before bedtime, to get a night of quality sleep. If your situation allows, you can still work out between 3 pm to 6 pm. It can be your first half of the second workout for the day. Energy is usually high around this time.  You can also avoid cravings and unhealthy snacking during your workout time. Have a post-workout meal, which serves as your afternoon snack like the food I mentioned for the morning snack, or a fruit and veggie smoothie with yogurt, nut milk, and fruits.  You can also have overnight oats and chia pudding if you want something sweet, such as milk, oats, chia seeds, nuts, fruits, and nut butter. You can eat similar foods you had for lunch but aim for a lighter meal at night.  Make sure to achieve the proper fullness and satisfaction so you can avoid cravings after dinner. You can have fewer grains and protein but still have more cooked vegetables (stir-fried, poached, or blanched mixed veggies and soup). Try to eat slowly, and instead of watching the television or checking your phone, make time to communicate with your family while enjoying your dinner. Complete your household chores, do your self-care night routine, and reward yourself with your favorite non-food nighttime activities during these hours. Allot 15 to 20 minutes of reviewing your day (challenges and accomplishments with food, physical activities, moods, work, and relationships), so you can effectively plan for the next day. Recognize your blessings for the day, say your prayers, hug your loved ones and get your well-deserved seven to eight hours of complete and quality sleep.

Keeping your eyes clear and healthy during the pandemic,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388684/keeping-your-eyes-clear-and-healthy-during-the-pandemic/,"12:08 PM September 23, 2021","Since the coronavirus broke out last year, people have been limited to the confines of their own dwellings and community, limiting everyone to certain activities, a compliance to a worldwide protocol that is seen to abate if not totally control the health devastation of this pandemic. Even appointments with healthcare professionals have been controlled, with priorities given to urgent medical matters.  Other health concerns such as eye care are sometimes considered as non-urgent. At the same time, people continue to be exposed to blue light coming from electronic gadgets like mobile phones, computers, and tablets.  Blue light exposure or the long exposure to gadgets and computers may lead to increased risk of eye problems like tired eyes, eye strain, macular degeneration and other eye-related problems for both young and adult persons. Hence, the need for proper eye care. The importance of eye care should also be given emphasis for the frontliners and health workers who are emotionally, mentally and physically stressed out, not to mention the tired eyes they also suffer from due to long hours of work. Tired eyes can also affect the quality of their work since it may cause blurry vision, burning or itching eyes, headache, watery or dry eyes, increased sensitivity to light, difficulty to focus, and related conditions. Blue light exposure and tired eyes should be addressed immediately to help avoid more serious eye conditions. Fortunately, one pharmaceutical company is committed to help prevent possible eye problems most people face today. vitaCLEAR, an eye supplement of Vendiz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was formulated to help slow down age-related macular degeneration or AMD and  help boost our eye health. vitaCLEAR is rich with 10 vitamins and minerals such as Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Zinc, Selenium, Omega-3 Fatty Acid, Vitamin A, B3, B12, C, and E which have antioxidant properties for eye healthcare. According to medical studies, progression of the disease may be slowed, stopped, and sometimes may even be improved by taking high doses of certain antioxidants including vitamins A, C, E and minerals copper, zinc and selenium. There is also some evidence that a diet containing enough lutein and zeaxanthin may help reduce the risk of AMD. vitaCLEAR contains these two important nutrients needed to protect our eyes and improve our eye health – – lutein and zeaxanthin, which are present in high levels in dark green leafy and yellow vegetables and provide a potent antioxidant effect. One tablet of vitaCLEAR each day gives a person an ample dose of the 10 essential nutrients including Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Vitamin B3, Vitamin B12, Selenium, Zinc, and Omega 3 fatty acid for your optimum eye care. vitaCLEAR is available in all leading drugstores nationwide, Lazada and other online stores.

How to overcome negative weight loss mindsets that can harm your health,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388177/how-to-overcome-negative-weight-loss-mindsets-that-can-harm-your-health/,"12:56 PM September 13, 2021","Every day, I deal with clients who have weight goals and issues. There are so many people who are deeply concerned about their weight, physical appearance, and dieting and who often resort to extreme strategies like overexercising or depriving oneself of the much-needed nutrients that can harm one’s health. Similarly, my body image issues when I was younger brought me to this career, so I could have a deeper understanding of weight, food, and movement. I believe that you can always change your way of thinking about your body, health, and fitness to achieve balance and successful long-term weight control. Being preoccupied with your weight by stepping on the scale every day or several times a day is not healthy behavior. It is important to consider that sustainable healthy lifestyle change is about prioritizing the process of creating new habits in your day by planning your eating, integrating movement into your day, and getting the appropriate amount of rest and sleep. You need to see the bigger picture of positively embracing a whole new lifestyle, instead of considering a lower number on the scale as the ultimate solution to your problems. Weight loss is just one of the results of all your lifestyle efforts. If you have health goals, you can weigh yourself once a week at most to see your progress, but don’t let the scale affect your moods. You can track other health and fitness parameters to monitor your weight management progress without obsessing too much on the scale-like blood pressure, body fat percentage, heart rate and how your body feels every day when you walk or climb the stairs. Avoid spending too much time on social media, looking at unrealistic, perfect bodies. Give more time to focus on your strengths and unique qualities.  Be inspired by what you have and what you can do right now. You have more time at home during this pandemic to sit down, set realistic goals for yourself, and think of ways on how you can improve more as a person so you can be a better inspiration to all. Share your thoughts and current issues with your loved ones, trusted friends, or a life coach. Express your feelings and don’t be afraid to be judged. Twenty years ago, I was able to discuss my deepest thoughts about my body issues with my boyfriend, who is now my husband. His emphatic acceptance and listening to how I felt that time really helped me and transformed my way of thinking. All-or-nothing thinking or seeing things black and white can sabotage your weight loss efforts: “I already stopped eating chips for several weeks already, but I was really craving. So I had a few pieces, but it was so good. Well, I already ruined my perfect plan, I might as well eat the whole bag.” Or: “I didn’t start my week with a workout. I feel so bad. so I will just try to work out again next week.” Always do your best in your healthy lifestyle endeavors to achieve your goals, but always be prepared to handle challenges and shortcomings along the way. You might have planned a complete exercise schedule and a healthy food menu for the whole week. However, unplanned situations might just happen during the week as a surprise visit from your best friend during your workout time. Don’t let a slip or failure like eating a slice of cake ruin your day. Create a daily lifestyle game plan, but always have alternative plans.  Practice thinking in moderation. Over-eating after a social gathering might be a trigger for you to punish yourself with a three-hour workout and once-a-day meal the next day. However, extreme weight-loss behaviors can disrupt the balance in your system. Mental functions, energy level, appetite, hormones, health, and metabolism will be negatively affected. Learn and understand what’s happening to your body. There is always science behind safe and effective weight management. Read, research, study, or take a course if needed. When I was just starting my career in fitness, I studied and learned everything I could in fitness, nutrition, and psychology to achieve a balanced lifestyle and healthy relationship with my body. Now, I am happily sharing everything I learned and experienced in health and fitness. Spend more time to learn more about yourself by starting a journal. You can write down everything like your lifestyle (sleep, food intake, exercise), thoughts, and feelings. So you can find balance in everything that you do. It always starts with good intentions and self-awareness, If you want to jumpstart the process, approach a coach who can help and guide you with your journey. It’s good to be being accountable to someone who can hear your thoughts and give you the most personalized program approach.

How to be at your healthiest and fittest during the pandemic,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387242/how-to-be-at-your-healthiest-and-fittest-during-the-pandemic/,"01:45 PM August 23, 2021","You can achieve a fitter body and improve your overall health by resetting your mindset, being open to changes and new challenges, despite of what is happening in the world. One of the best things that you can do right now is to invest more focus and effort to be at your healthiest, so you can live longer for your loved ones. When the lockdown started, one of my clients immediately approached me regarding online coaching.  I wasn’t really sure that time if all my existing clients would also embrace the idea of virtual workout sessions.  However, there was no other option at that time but to let them try online Zoom coaching sessions. They loved the new exercise training concept- a formal exercise session at the comfort of their homes! So that’s how a brand new phase in my life all started. It was such a blessing for me and my husband Armand, who is also a health and fitness coach to continue our mission in helping people improve their health and lifestyle.  I was able to use my skills, experience, and knowledge through online fitness coaching while being at my best health, despite this pandemic. Now I have more energy and motivation to share what I have so I can effectively help others achieve their fitness goals. Here are some of my learnings and personal experience that I share with my clients. I am always excited to get out of bed as early as 4 or 5 am to enjoy my “me” time. My early morning ritual prepares me mentally and emotionally for a long day that starts as early as 6:30 am. This morning habit includes self-assessment, planning, work preparation (fitness programs), morning chores, self-care, and online shopping. You can avoid distractions and start your day right by creating your own early “me time” in the comfort of your own house. However, you need to consider your sleeping time which is very important for productivity and health. Discipline is key to success. Avoid late-night television watching and keep your phone away from you right before sleeping. I believe that environment plays a major role in one’s well-being. I used to exercise in the gym for weight training and cardio and run outdoors occasionally. Now, I have my own exercise/workspace in our bedroom and my husband has his own in the living room. It is really important to have an exercise space at home where you can place at least an exercise mat so you can consistently do your fitness routine. The food environment plays a huge impact on weight management. I always stock up on healthy foods and snacks like nuts and seeds, oats, quinoa, brown rice, multi-grain bread, fruits, vegetables, coconut water, nut milk, nut butter, seafood, egg, chicken, and lean meat. You can always order healthy foods which are readily available online. Keep unhealthy foods out of sight.  Avoid buying junk foods and sweets.  If someone gives you high-calorie foods like pastries, cookies, and cakes, you can have a bite to taste, but share and give the rest away. Devote more time for food planning and preparation to avoid impulse buying of high-calorie foods online.  I’ve been eating the same breakfast (egg and toast) and snacks (chia pudding, fruits, or green smoothie) during the whole pandemic. Teamwork is always important. My husband is the one assigned for lunch (mixed quinoa and brown rice, veggies, and protein) and I always prepare dinner (more veggies and protein) right after work. To combat sweet cravings, I prepare my healthy nutty, and fruity desserts weekly like sugar-free banana bread and energy balls. Assess your weekly food intake and have a weekly healthy menu for the whole family.  You can always check for quick and healthy recipes for your favorite foods online. Steam, boil, broil, saute your main meals. Avoid deep-fried, saucy, and salty viands.  Fill your stomach with simple and quick green dishes like vegetable wraps, salad, baked mixed veggies, and blanched leafy vegetables.  Drink enough water and avoid liquid calories from alcohol, flavored drinks, and sodas. Aside from my formal workouts, I used to complete at least 10,000 steps pre-pandemic.  Surprisingly, I can complete 10,000- 15,000 steps for the whole day just by my moving around and working out with my clients inside a 45 sqm unit where we live. Yes, it is possible to complete your desired steps even at home. In fact, I have several clients who can complete more than 8,000 steps every day inside their house using their cardio machines, joining zoom classes, and walking around the house. Keep or increase your exercise motivation by investing in a good fitness wearable that can track your calories burned, heart rate, number of steps, and even sleep quality. Keep an exercise journal so you can start or keep a well-balanced weekly exercise routine consisting of 20 to 60 minutes daily of cardiovascular exercises (dancing, circuit training with light weights, indoor cycling, treadmill or outdoor walking/running, swimming, HIIIT workouts), two to four times a week of resistance training (bodyweight or equipment-based strength exercises) and flexibility and core training.

King mushrooms are a staple in barbecue joints in Seoul for good reason. They are cheaper and their sweet meat can give beef a run for its money. Shiitake can make a decent filling for wheat buns. It has a nice, chewy texture reminiscent of the shredded pork filling in siopao. Enoki, meanwhile, is great for grilling on its own or wrapped with bacon. If you’re already salivating from the dish options for mushrooms, then perhaps it is time to grow your own. Mushrooms make for a great addition to any garden. Oyster mushroom fruiting bags are your best option if you want to try growing them. Prices range from P50-P100/bag. “We grow our own food because our town is far from supermarkets in the city,” said Monie Suganob, a modern farmer in Lambunao, Iloilo. “Growing them is also fast. The mycelium can start to show in a week after opening the mouth of the bag. ” You have to be patient at this point and let it grow out. Wait for the mushrooms to bloom for a couple of days before you harvest, to allow it to bloom in full. Suganob added that the most important thing about growing mushrooms is finding the right spot for it. “It has to be placed in a shaded area, away from direct sunlight. Make sure that it’s not exposed to insects like ants,” she advised. This writer’s aunt agrees. Marilou Navarra grew 50 bags in one cycle because she thought she could use the harvest for her catering business. “I found out that they don’t grow at the same time. You have to have hundreds to be able to do that,” she said. Navarra grew her bags in a clean and sterile environment. Bacteria can easily fester in the fruiting bags, preventing growth of the mycelium. Paranoia also made her mist her fungi with distilled water, but any clean water will do. Eden Panesales, in charge of mushroom production at the Department of Agriculture in Western Visayas, says a sterile area is really important. Fungi are very sensitive and any odorous area is detrimental to their health. Keeping them away from the garbage area will ensure their growth. Keeping the right temperature for mushrooms is also important. During summer, mushrooms need to be misted at least three times a day. Misting means one to two spritzes on the mouth of the bags. “I don’t check for temperature. You can base it on your comfort level. If it’s hot, they need misting. When it’s cool, you can let them be,” Navarra said. Panesales added that humidity is very important to mushrooms. Growers can put them next to a humidifier. As an alternative, covering the bags with wet towels will also do. To prevent ants from getting to her bags, she placed them horizontally on top of wires. But any place where the mushrooms can grow from the mouth of the bags should suffice. Just keep checking for insects. It’s also normal to get bags where there are holes on the side. If mushrooms grow out of these holes, just let them be and enjoy the yield. Penasales said that a ready-to-fruit bag can give you 300-500 grams of mushrooms in a span of three to five months.

Is your stress level unhealthy? A symptoms checklist,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/377371/is-your-stress-level-unhealthy-a-symptoms-checklist/,"10:24 PM January 12, 2021","(First of two parts) Even during pre-COVID times, about a third of patients we saw in the clinic had stress-related symptoms. During the pandemic, this has easily doubled in incidence. Most of them really have some medical or health issues; but constant, inadequately managed stress has blown their symptoms out of scale. We call it the mole hill-mountain syndrome because of the patient’s propensity to magnify small problems into major health issues because of their stress, fear or anxiety. And an excessive paranoia toward COVID-19 has made many victims of this syndrome. One patient we saw regularly in the clinic had adequately controlled blood pressure, with just one antihypertensive pill. After her spouse and son got infected with the virus in the early stage of the pandemic, she had this constant fear that she would soon have it, too. Fortunately, she has been spared so far, but her hypertension has taken an entirely different pattern, and now requires a three-drug combination to keep it from rising to perilous levels. Another patient had stable coronary artery disease before the onset of the pandemic. He had a single blocked artery, which we deemed could be adequately controlled with conservative medical treatment, and not requiring aggressive intervention. But a few months into the lockdown, he started having more frequent and more severe angina or chest pains. He was rushed to a nearby medical center one night and the doctors there decided to do a coronary angioplasty to ease the heart artery blockage. For some, the COVID-related fear and anxiety may make them imagine all sorts of symptoms from shortness of breath or easy fatiguability to bum stomach or colicky abdominal pains; yet all tests would turn out to be unremarkable. Excessive fear and anxiety increases the stress hormone cortisol, which shifts the body’s mode of action from growth and regeneration to a fight-or-flight mode. This weakens the body’s immune system and can make us more vulnerable to diseases. In a way, it’s also true what they say that stress can make us dumber because the brain gets relatively less blood supply, which is shunted to the muscles due to the fight-or-flight response. Hence, we may have a relatively impaired brain functioning, judgment and decision-making. Decision makers, like our government officials, must really be good at stress-management. The public welfare hangs in the balance with some decisions they make. We don’t want them making crucial decisions when their cortisol levels are shooting through the roof. It’s understandable to be really under stress during this time. Public health measures, such as quarantine and social distancing, can make people feel lonely and isolated. That can increase stress and anxiety more via a snowballing effect. Stress is not inherently bad though. Some degree of stress is healthy, as it is a coping or compensatory mechanism. The fight-or-flight response is also needed for survival, such as when we’re confronted with a life-threatening situation like being attacked by the proverbial saber-toothed tiger. But this should not be persistent. When it remains for prolonged periods of time, so there’s practically no more stress-free interval, then physical, emotional and mental turmoil can occur in our body and mind. If you have any of the following symptoms, your stress level may already be on the unhealthy side: Do you constantly worry about COVID-19 for yourself and your loved ones? Do you have this lingering fear or belief that it’s just a matter of time before you or your loved ones will get the infection? Is there any change in your eating pattern or bowel movement? Are you having appetite problems, either overeating or anorexia? Do you have difficulty in concentrating in your work or study? Do you have sleeping problems? Do you wake up in the middle of the night feeling agitated or restless? Do you lose your temper more easily? Do you feel unusual symptoms of being unwell you didn’t feel before? Do you have a feeling of hopelessness about the current pandemic and can’t seem to see the light at the end of the tunnel? If you answered yes to any three of the questions, then it may be necessary to take a pause and seriously address your stress problem. Our stress may have occupied a good part of our conscious and subconscious minds, so we have to start addressing it there. A healthy positive mind-set is the starting point of any stress-management regimen. INQ (To be continued)   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Reproductive health: 5 tips to always practice,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/376177/reproductive-health-5-tips-to-always-practice/,"05:59 PM December 14, 2020","Reproductive and sexual health should be given just as much importance as other aspects of physical and mental health. Most women tend to start their sexual health journey only when problems arise, but prevention is always better than a cure. Whatever your goal is as a woman, whether it’s to bear a child someday or to maintain a safe sexual life, it’s important to keep these reproductive and sexual health tips in mind. It’s recommended to see an obstetrician-gynecologist as early as your first period. Discuss and establish a health management plan with your OB-GYN that includes regular medical tests, with the goal of preventing sexual and reproductive diseases. Make your OB-GYN visits a part of your regular routine, even when you do not feel any particular symptoms or are not even sexually active. Ask about contraception and vaccines, especially at the start of your sexual exploration. Whether you’re planning to have a child or not, it’s important to track your period so you can detect any discrepancies right away. Keep in mind, however, that the standard 28-day cycle doesn’t necessarily apply to all women. The University College London and Natural Cycles USA Corp’s joint study on menstrual cycles found that the average cycle lasts 29.3 days, with only thirteen percent of women having cycles lasting 28 days. Ovulation doesn’t necessarily occur on Day 14 always, so it’s crucial to determine your own cycle length. You can do this by consulting with your OB-GYN or using apps such as Clue. This is especially useful if you’re planning for pregnancy or are trying to avoid it. Practicing safe sex is not only for birth control, but also to maintain good sexual health—helping you prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STD). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s STD information page is a good resource to learn about various STDs and how to manage them, if diagnosed. While there is no sure-fire way to eliminate the risks of STDs aside from abstinence, it is nonetheless important to practice safe sex by using contraceptives such as condoms. It is also recommended to get tested regularly and avoid engaging in sex with partners you don’t know very well. While it may still be taboo in conservative cultures, female masturbation has a wealth of benefits. In fact, cognitive neuroscientist and licensed sex therapist Nan Wise reveals that it can be a source of empowerment and a self-esteem and mood booster. PrettyMe’s guide to bullet vibrators shares that there are many beginner-friendly devices available, which are designed to stimulate the clitoris. Vibrators, similar to other sex toys, can help users achieve orgasm—which is known to improve sleep, decrease muscle tension, and reduce stress too. To establish good reproductive health, women should maintain a diet rich in calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, iron, and folate. HelpGuide’s list of diet tips for women enumerates ideal sources of iron such as breakfast cereals. Braised beef liver, on the other hand, tops the list of good sources of folate. In any case, it’s always best to get the proper nutrition from natural food sources, but if you ever find it difficult to maintain this diet, food supplements are a reliable alternative.  Despite the recommendation to start a healthy sexual journey while you’re young, know that it’s never too late to begin either. Celebrate your womanhood today by prioritizing your sexual health. As feminist philosopher Harriet Beecher Stowe puts it, “a woman’s health is her capital.”     CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Here’s How Gardening Benefits Your Health,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/373547/heres-how-gardening-benefits-your-health/,"04:48 PM October 28, 2020","If you’re still on the fence about buying an herb in your local supermarket because on one hand, you’ll have something to keep you sane while staying at home; and on the other hand, you’re too lazy to grow one; learning about the benefits of keeping plants around might just be enough reasons for you to finally put it in your cart and check it out. Here are six proven health benefits of gardening:  Since it requires the use of your cognitive functions, research shows that gardening is effective in keeping your mind sharp. Not only does it help improve your memory, but tending to your plants for even a few hours a day will lower your risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s. 2. Makes You Active and Stay in Shape The author of the book, Fitness the Dynamic Gardening Way, Jeff Restuccio, explained to WebMD that you can turn your gardening into a structured exercise routine. So, if you miss hitting the gym due to the pandemic, growing vegetables in your backyard is a perfect alternative to your workouts since three hours of gardening equates to an hour of a gym session. Plus, you don’t need to pay for a membership fee. It’s a win-win for your body and your wallet! 3. Healthier Diet By growing your own food, you will find yourself more in control of what you put in your body. Freshly picked fruits, vegetables, and herbs have more nutrients than what you normally buy from the store. On top of that, sustainably cultivating your plants will make for richer and delicious produce, thus making it easy to incorporate more greens into your diet. 4. Relieves Stress  The relaxing nature of doing gardening activities is in itself a stress reliever. Studies further proved that taking care of plants daily can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Not only that, exposure to sunlight makes your body produce Vitamin D, and in turn, Vitamin D produces serotonin, which is a brain chemical that makes you happy! 5. Better Sleep Doing physical activities such as gardening will not only tire you out at the end of the day. Owing to the light therapy given off by the sun, you will also have adequate melatonin to help you sleep well at night, and realign your sleep patterns for an energy-filled morning the next day. Your indoor plants are also a huge factor for a good night’s sleep. Plants with air-cleaning properties can clear out air particles and remove harmful chemicals, leaving you with excellent air quality while asleep. 6. Improve Immunity  Being exposed to a sufficient amount of “the sunshine vitamin” also keeps your bones, teeth, and muscles healthy, not to mention it boosts your immune system; while the dirt in your garden is home to a good bacteria called, Mycobacterium vaccae, a “friendly” soil bacteria that also helps in strengthening your immunity. Although it’s something we don’t always consider doing, taking part in gardening activities does benefit our overall health – from physical to mental. That is why purchasing that basil plant you’ve been eyeing for long, is already a great start. And, what better way to begin your journey in horticulture is with the use of recyclable materials to help with the efforts on environmental sustainability. Thankfully, with initiatives like ARC Refreshments Corp’s “Grow as One” campaign that promotes sustainable urban gardening, we have support in creating our own garden however small it may be. The “Grow as One” campaign shows the company’s resiliency amidst the new normal. Through this campaign, the employee-led project called “My Gulay Garden” was launched. It aims to encourage the community to recycle RC Cola PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles as containers in growing their plants. Given both the short and long-term positive impact of gardening on our health, it’s just fitting that the environment receives the same as well. Because what do we need good health for, if the earth, the very home we live in, dies. So be mindful of growing your fruits, vegetables, or herbs. Reduce. Reuse. And recycle those PET bottles.

Keeping teens healthy in this challenging time,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/366692/keeping-teens-healthy-in-this-challenging-time/,"04:26 PM July 20, 2020","The quarantine may have eased but parents should remain vigilant especially when it comes to their teen’s health. This age group’s active and outgoing nature can make them vulnerable to sickness. Yet, a strong immune system is still people’s best defense against an invisible enemy.

Help them keep a routine and make sure gadgets are off by bedtime. Eat a balanced diet  No single food can prevent people from getting COVID-19. But eating a healthy balanced diet can help the immune system function better against viruses and diseases. A balanced diet for teens does not mean a meal of junk treats like donuts, bag of chips or soda but a plate that contains a variety of food like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, and dairy as it will help them to get the nutrients their growing bodies need.

Why people living with mental illness don’t talk about it,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/363918/why-people-living-with-mental-illness-dont-talk-about-it/,"01:06 PM June 07, 2020","“How are you today?” he asked me. I was not supposed to say, “I feel fine, thank you. Never been better. I’m okay.” It was not the usual greeting. My doctor, my second psychiatrist in three years, meant: how’s my mood; do the medications work well; or do you feel any different. I knew the drill. It was June 4, 2013. After undergoing a series of tests and evaluation, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and dysthymia. I was taking medication and psychotherapy for three years until I was able to manage my symptoms. It was a long and arduous journey toward healing. In 2016, my doctor advised me to stop taking medications. He wished me luck. As I was leaving the room, he told me to come back anytime — that means, anytime I have symptoms again. At the hospital, I saw several patients from all walks of life, ages, and genders. We were people living with mental health problems or illness. At the reception area, there were dozens of patients waiting for their turns. Some were living with heart diseases, others were living with hypertension, or leukemia, or cancers, or other illnesses that have been plaguing humanity. According to MentalHelp.net, triggers are external events or circumstances that may produce very uncomfortable emotional or psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, panic, discouragement, despair, or negative self-talk. These could be anything — from dates, news, smells, trauma, neglect, physical illnesses, frightening news events, etc. The COVID-19 pandemic is just one of the causes of depression; it even brought about a rise in suicides during recent months. In Thailand, where I am based, 38 suicide attempts were recorded, resulting in 28 deaths as of April 25. These statistics do not even include foreigners. Usually, financial problems were seen as the cause that led them to suicide. In the early morning of June 4, I received a news link in my private messages about a Filipino teacher in Thailand who died due to suicide. There was no trigger warning. I know the friends who shared it with me meant well, but it was way too early in the morning when I received the news. My day and the days that followed were filled with a series of dreadful thoughts. I had heart palpitations the whole day. I was crying silently while the people around me were minding their own business. I even cried more when I read the comments that subtly blamed him for giving up, criticizing him because he did not open up with friends or he did not read the Word of God and that he gave up and that it was a sin to kill yourself. I was triggered. Most people living with mental illness would rather not talk to friends and family members. It is not easy for us to just open up. Why? We do not want to burden our loved ones with our emotional or mental problems. We are also afraid that our friends and family members would ostracize us. We are afraid that we will be dismissed as “too emotional.” I read a lot of comforting words, words of caution, Bible verses, and advice from well-meaning people whenever I hear of someone who died due to suicide. But these people put the onus on the person living with mental illness: you “should have sought advice,” or “should have talked to a friend,” or “should have read the Word of God,” and so on. It’s difficult to talk about problems, especially during the global pandemic when everyone is struggling. A person living with mental illness also finds it hard to speak about his problems and may talk like this: “Point A” segues to “Point C, F, P” then back to “Point A” then “Point B.” It is irritating, I tell you. Even my loved ones dismissed me for talking like that. And if they can do that, how much more a friend? They would just find it amusing at first, but they can get annoyed later on. When I was having therapy, I just sat there, silent, for a long time. My doctor just sat and waited for me to talk. I had different emotions. Sometimes, I would be excited to tell him about my discoveries — food, insects, anything. There are times when I would just sit there and ask him questions. During the sessions when I could not talk, the doctor would talk to a family member. People living with mental illness are not like how they are portrayed in movies — violent people, killers, maniacs, or the incarnation of evil. The most caring people I know are people living with mental illness. They are so empathetic that they would give away their last peso to those in need. But what makes us different from other people? We all experience loneliness, fear, and other emotions. However, most people who live with mental illness cannot handle those feelings as others would. For example, a person who doesn’t deal with mental illness can have depression or feelings of loneliness for a few days. However, for a person with mental illness, depression may take years before they can overcome it, if they can even overcome it. It can result in several physical problems, like heart diseases, stomach ulcers, or allergies. I get allergies: eczema, or pruritis, a form of psoriasis. Despite this, people living with mental illness can even function far better than others. We work. We beat the deadline. You can assign us even the most complicated tasks and we can accomplish them. We may not talk about our problems, but we send signals. Thus, it is important to include a trusted family member or a friend during therapy. I may not talk for days. I just write and write, or eat and eat. Sometimes, I lose my appetite. Most people living with mental illness also feel an indescribable pain. We want to numb our senses just to get away from it. I have a particular medication that whenever I take it, I don’t feel anything. I only do routine activities, like bathing, eating, or working. People living with mental illness do not always experience abuse, or suffer from trauma, or are deprived of love. Scientific evidence points out the chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters between nerve cells in the brain, which can cause mental illness. Still, there are more studies needed to fully establish that. Some claim that serotonin is needed to balance this. Therefore, eating and avoiding some foods are said to help. Some experts also say that exercising and doing things that make you feel good produces serotonin. June 21 marks the second anniversary of the first mental health act in the Philippines or the Mental Health Law (Republic Act 11036), authored and sponsored by Senator Risa Hontiveros. It recognizes the importance of providing medical care to persons living with mental illness as well as protecting their rights. According to Senator Hontiveros, seven Filipinos turn to suicide every day. One in five Filipino adults also suffers from a form of mental disorder. The Mental Health Law cements the government’s commitment to a more holistic approach to healthcare: without sound mental health, there can be no genuine physical health. But the passage of the law does not mean the social stigma regarding mental health has ended. We still need to educate our families, our friends, and society at large on mental health. I’m not asking you to be kind. I only ask you not to judge people like me or like them. We have to overcome the social stigma.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
"Eat This, Not That: What you need to trade off for a healthier diet",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/343456/eat-this-not-that-what-you-need-need-to-trade-off-for-a-healthier-diet/,"03:37 PM August 22, 2019","Eating well can be so difficult at times. Dieting is often associated with being very restrictive–don’t eat that, don’t drink that! This is why diets are difficult. We often feel deprived of our favorite foods, and it can be stressful when we are not able to fulfill our cravings. With this in mind, I’ve devised a swapping technique that helps me handle cravings for not-so-healthy foods while staying satisfied and on track with a diet proper for me. Here’s a list of some of the healthier alternatives that I swap for my favorite foods, aka my most common sinful cravings. Eating a high-sugar diet can have serious consequences for your mental and physical health. From weight gain to heart disease to even mental illnesses, the problems that sugar poses to one’s body is endless. Sugar is also known to contribute to the growth of cancer! This sweet substance is considered as the universal inflammatory, and it doesn’t help that sugar is found in virtually everything we consume, which is why a little effort to avoid sugar can go a long way for your health, such as using stevia when you can. Stevia is a plant-based, calorie-free sweetener, it doesn’t raise blood sugar levels like sugar, and other artificial sweeteners do. I always keep stevia packets on me just in case my coffee needs a sweet kick. I find almond milk to be the best non-dairy substitute for milk. Although dairy milk has its benefits like being rich in calcium, cow’s milk is high in saturated fat and can also lead to coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and digestive issues. Not to mention, dairy, in general, causes inflammation to one’s body. Almond milk is naturally free of cholesterol, saturated fat, and lactose. It’s rich in calcium, vitamins D, E and A, and has far fewer calories than other types of milk. I typically take my coffee black, but when I do crave a creamy cappuccino, I opt for the almond milk version. This happens quite often so the few grams of fat and sugar avoided do add up! Speaking of coffee, this delicious drink (can you tell it’s my absolute fave?) is the best for you when taken black, without the added dairy and sugar. As the third most-consumed drink in the world behind water and tea, coffee can be prepared a million different ways and is oftentimes prepared with so much added calories that it can rack up more calories than your average dessert or meal. That’s not good. I happen to love vanilla lattes, but with some time and adjustment, I’ve grown to love simple, black coffee. And since I drink it numerous times a day, keeping it black saves me from all those unwanted calories. Whether or not you have celiac’s disease or a wheat allergy, I am a huge advocate of eating wheat-free as much as possible. People may think that wheat-free means gluten-free. That’s not entirely accurate. Gluten is one of the few proteins associated with wheat that causes a lot of health issues. The truth is the modern-day diet has way too much gluten that the body is meant to consume. Avoiding gluten usually involves cutting back on processed foods, as it’s found in a wide array of highly processed foods, such as fast food, baked goods, and sugary cereals. Like sugar and dairy, gluten is a known culprit for causing inflammation, so having some or too much of it can lead to a slew of issues such as a leaky gut, type 1 diabetes in children of mothers who consume gluten, autoimmune diseases like Crohn’s disease, skin disorders like eczema and psoriasis, and brain fog. Those do not sound like fun, right? So, I highly recommend avoiding wheat- or gluten-laded carbohydrates. Instead, you can get your daily recommended carb intake from vegetables (that would be the most ideal), or there are wheat-free options for popular carbs such gluten-free bread and pasta. I’d go for vegetables, but if you can’t resist, there’s low-glycemic and low-calorie shirataki noodles, or good ole rice! Just be careful of your portions–just because it’s gluten-free, doesn’t mean there’s no sugar, fat or high grams of carbs. Sugar is sugar. It’s terrible for you, but I know life would be pretty depressing if we didn’t get to enjoy an occasional sweet treat or a bit of chocolate here or there. Which is why chocolate is my go-to to satisfy my sweet cravings, but not just any chocolate, I go dark. When it comes to which type of chocolate is the healthiest, the answer is simple: it’s dark chocolate by a landslide. Dark chocolate varieties contain super-high cocoa contents (usually 70 to 80 percent, but many up to 100!), which means they contain more flavanols–a heart-healthy antioxidant–than milk chocolate. But the more cocoa you have, the more bitter your chocolate will be—and that’s exactly why milk chocolate adds in a lot of milk and sugar to sweeten things up. Unfortunately, eating something that’s primarily sugar and saturated fat is a no-go for your health. But don’t worry: You can still get your choco-fix and do something good for your body at the same time. Experts recommend sticking with varieties that are 70 percent cocoa or higher to reap the benefits—like helping you fight off disease and even make you smarter. Plus, dark chocolate is packed with important minerals—like magnesium, zinc, and iron—which can also help keep your brain healthy as you age. When I think of Heaven, I imagine endless pastries, chocolates, mocha lattes, and cookies. Sweets galore! These are undoubtedly my biggest temptation while living here in Manila. With that said, they are also some of the worst possible foods out there. They are laden with bad fats, gluten, refined sugar, and insulin-spiking carbohydrates. When I’m hit with a craving for any of these sweet treats, I turn to the much healthier alternatives I listed above. In a picture-perfect world, we wouldn’t encounter or crave for foods like these that are so incredibly detrimental to one’s health, but the reality is that we do. Every single day, in every café, restaurant, and grocery store. Avoiding these all together for long periods would be so stressful, and somewhat sad, in my honest opinion. I truly believe in having a balanced lifestyle. With that said, balanced doesn’t mean I encourage eating terribly. Balanced to me means that you are able to properly nourish and care for your body, while also enjoying the food you eat. These healthy swaps allow me to do that, and I hope me sharing this with you will help you to do so as well.  Tips to make your workout work!

Theravada meditation tradition for holistic human health,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/342704/theravada-meditation-tradition-for-holistic-human-health/,"06:27 PM August 11, 2019","COLOMBO — The research world over has today proven that meditation techniques cause detectable changes in the body and mind which are conducive to physical, psychological and spiritual wellbeing of a person. Meditation as a stress buster and a tool of fighting anxiety and addictions is well established. However, as Dr. Dilshani Dissanayake tells the Sunday Island, a large scale scientific study to demonstrate the effect of Buddhist Theravada meditation on the whole body and also to test meditation and mindfulness as a positive therapeutic and community intervention has not been carried out in the world so far. The research undertaking by the University of Colombo thus becomes a watershed in this context, she adds. “Although mindfulness has become a much sought after subject today, it is only one component of the Buddhist Theravada meditation tradition. What we seek to study is the effect of this deep meditation tradition on the body and brain from genes, molecules, chemicals, organs, body systems such as cardio-respiratory and neurology, education, psychology and behavior which reflects on the environment and social harmony. Hence, it is a broad spectrum of studies.” The study undertaken by the Research Promotion and Facilitation Center (RPFC) of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo will assess the possibility of incorporating meditation protocols to complement management of diseases such as asthma, metabolic syndrome, neurological diseases and cancer. The study, as Dr. Dissanayake says, is financially supported by the World Bank and will result in nine MPhil/PhDs. The team consisting of 30 members is equipped with advanced techniques, made possible by the grant. The research entails five clusters:a) genetics, b) biochemical, immunological, cardio-respiratory and neurophysiological parameters, c) patient groups, d) psychology and e) behavior related to social harmony and climate change. These will be conducted in two phases. “We will begin the first phase of data collection from mid-August, initially from the meditation centers in the country. This will be followed by the enrolling of healthy volunteers from the community who have not regularly meditated before but are willing to embark on a regular meditation program,” explains the RPFC’s Director. The interventions through meditation are economically, socially and culturally applicable to any society, observes the Neuroscientist. As the custodian of the Theravada Buddhism, Sri Lanka can offer a feasible set-up to embark on a study of this nature. “Our pilot studies have already proven the feasibility of the research,” she says. The findings by the RPFC’s research will add new knowledge to the existing literature on the effects of meditation, says Dr. Dissanayake. “These mind-based interventions could supplement or replace costly pharmacological interventions in diseases and minimize unpleasant suppressive interventions for negative behaviors of individuals in the society. If successful interventions could be developed and implemented, the effects of these interventions would have a significant positive impact on individual wellbeing along with social, cultural, environmental and economic development of the world.” As the Senior Lecturer further notes, there is a large group of academics and scientists who are practicing different techniques of meditation presently and the University of Colombo is a repository of their knowledge and findings. With mounting interest in alternative roots all over the world to alleviate symptoms and signs of diseases, prevent diseases, minimize suffering due to stress and suppress negative behaviors affecting social harmony and the environment, embarking on a project which examines widely used scientifically based ‘mind controlling’ techniques on the human body from molecular level to the systems, disease processes and behavior is a timely venture, believes Dr. Dissanayake who is giving leadership to the research team. “The idea that meditation could be combined with therapeutic interventions for diseases based on scientific evidence and development of evidence based protocols and to test them on different diseases have not being done or reported in the world so far. A recently published article by the American Heart Association- Meditation and cardiovascular risk reduction, emphasizes the need for further studies on meditation and effects on the body and has summarized the limitations of published studies on neurocognition, cardiovascular and metabolic syndrome and diabetes,” she observes. Moreover, assessment of the effect of interventions on behavior of the community especially on social harmony and climate change is a novel phenomenon, says the neuroscientist. Another study for which the Colombo Medical Faculty’s neuroscience research laboratory, of the Department of Physiology is credited is the study on reading practices in post-stroke adult patients in Sri Lanka. The research was carried out by Nimeera Weerarathne a graduate in speech and language pathology and a PhD student of Dr. Dissanayake. “Reading is very much an integral part of a person’s life- it is closely associated professionally and personally. Reading is important even as a leisure time indulgence especially for older people. Thus, impairments in reading affect the quality of life of stroke-survivors. However, reading comprehension is not formally assessed by the clinicians or the speech therapists in patients who have had strokes with aphasia (loss of ability to speak) here at home or even in the region largely due to the absence of a tool to detect the deficit,” explains Dr. Dissanayake who goes on to note that the relevant tool should be in the primary language of the patient. The research team from the neuroscience laboratory had developed a valid tool in Sinhala language to assess reading comprehension difficulties in adults with aphasia following stroke. This tool, as Dr. Dissanayake explains, will help in identifying the deficits in patients and implementing management strategies early such as language training on reading comprehension based on the severity of the after effects of stroke. The research in this area will be ongoing she says, in order to develop assessments and interventions for rehabilitation of reading skills in post-stroke. Other projects conducted by the neuroscience research laboratory include in-depth research on the brain mechanisms involved in processing information received from the environment, falls in older adults, diabetic neuropathy, and neuronal damages due to drugs. Developing human resources to sustain and improve a positive research culture in the country is important, remarks Dr. Dissanayake who also elaborates on the importance of improving and implementing the outcomes of the research programs steered by the RPFC.

"Communal dipping, ‘a wartime eating habit with health consequences’",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/340758/communal-dipping-a-wartime-eating-habit-with-health-consequences/,"07:02 PM July 18, 2019","SEOUL — Chopsticks and spoons digging into the same dish are not an uncommon sight at Korean dining tables. Bowls of rice are served individually, but “banchan,” or side dishes, and “jjigae,” or stew, are often served communally, meant to be shared. Sharing stew from the same pot is not considered good table manners here, but many forego the ladle and small bowls that come with the stew, dipping their spoons directly into the pot. But this seemingly customary practice is not actually how Koreans used to eat. The communal dipping into the pot of stew is a wartime eating habit that could be detrimental to health, experts told The Korea Herald. According to Joo Young-ha, an anthropologist at the Academy of Korean Studies, this eating custom does not date too far back. Dining, even group dining, occurred at solo tables until the early 20th century. “Members of the royalty and aristocracy dined at individual tables. Even at large parties and banquets, the royals and aristocrats each sat at a table for one,” Joo said, adding, however, there is no record of how commoners dined. Multiple diners eating together on a large table is a fairly recent concept that emerged in the last century, according to Joo. In the 1920s and ’30s, during the Japanese colonial era, a movement for abolishing solitary dining tables emerged as food became scarcer. “Soupy dishes, which can feed more people with less ingredients, became popular during the Korean War. That’s when sharing food from the same bowl became common,” he said. Joo described the custom as “a habit formed during war for which there seems to be little reason to continue into present day.” And this is a trend increasingly less popular among younger Koreans. Kim Jong-yong, 28, is one of them. Kim said while he still sees it happen at dinners where drinks are involved, sharing food from the same bowl or plate without using serving utensils was “not for him.” However, more often than not, people won’t raise issue with the practice, especially in social situations. Yeo Hyun-goo, 26, said although he is uncomfortable with shared dishes, he pretends not to mind during a dinner with a workplace superior. There are also health reasons for discouraging communal stew-eating — including the spread of Helicobacter pylori bacteria found in the stomach. Lee Sang-gil, a gastroenterologist at Severance Hospital, said about one in two Koreans are infected with H. pylori. “In most developed countries, the figure is reported at about below 30 percent,” he said. While transmission routes of the stomach bacteria haven’t been determined yet, H. pylori infections are commonly seen among family members and among people who come into frequent contact with one another, according to Lee. “It’s difficult to trace how H. pylori is transmitted because there aren’t overt symptoms, and oftentimes (the infection) goes unnoticed. However, person-to-person transmission may involve the gastro-oral pathway,” Lee said, which is why caution is warranted when dining in groups. Lee said the higher the economic status and education level, the lower the rate of H. pylori infection observed, from which it can be inferred that living in a more hygienic environment leads to a lower infection rate. Infections of H. pylori, a World Health Organization-classified carcinogen, are associated with higher risks of developing gastric cancer. According to 2018 data from the National Cancer Center, gastric cancer was the most common cancer among Koreans in 2015 and 2016. Starting from January last year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has expanded state health insurance benefits to cover H. pylori eradication treatments in an effort to contain the spread of the bacterial infection and reduce the rate of gastric cancer. Aside from stomach cancer, gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma are other diseases related to H. pylori infection, Lee said. “The H. pylori infection rate has been gradually declining in Korea, and while there is no direct evidence linking H. pylori transmission with eating food from the same bowl per se, that still is in no way advisable,” he said.

Eating mushrooms may slow mental decline—study,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/327483/eating-mushrooms-may-slow-mental-decline-study/,"02:47 PM March 13, 2019","SINGAPORE — Eating more mushrooms could help keep mental decline at bay, a new study of more than 600 Singaporeans aged 60 and above has showed. Researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) found that participants who ate more than two servings of mushrooms a week – equivalent to 300g or about half a plate – were 57 percent less likely to have mild cognitive impairment compared with those who ate less than one portion a week. The study was conducted between 2011 and 2017. Announcing the findings on Tuesday (March 12), Dr Irwin Cheah, a senior research fellow at NUS’ Department of Biochemistry, said this could be because mushrooms contain high levels of a compound known as ergothioneine. The compound acts as an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory agent, and can protect brain cells from damage, Dr Cheah said. In a separate 2016 study also involving Dr Cheah , the researcher found that having a deficiency of the compound could be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. “Humans cannot synthesize this compound, but it can be obtained from dietary sources,” he explained. Dr Cheah said the researchers measured a range of foods and found that many, including beans and liver, contain low levels of the compound. Mushrooms, which are able to synthesize ergothioneine, were found to have very high levels of it. The study was part of the wider Diet and Healthy Ageing research done in Singapore. Those who were diagnosed with dementia or other serious mental conditions were excluded from the mushroom study. The participants were asked to report their regular diets, including the intake of six types of mushrooms commonly eaten in Singapore: golden mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, white button mushrooms, dried mushrooms and canned mushrooms. The researchers also controlled the intake of other foods known to be correlated with cognitive function, such as vegetables, fruit and nuts. The participants then took tests designed to measure cognitive abilities like memory and how quickly they can process information. The scores were controlled for age and education levels. Those who scored less than 1.5 standard deviations below the mean score of participants with similar ages and education levels were determined to have mild cognitive impairment. About 90 out of the 663 participants fell into this category. Mild cognitive impairment is the intermediate stage between normal cognitive decline, associated with ageing, and dementia, which is more serious and has no cure. The study’s principal investigator, Assistant Professor Feng Lei, said: “With the increasing number of seniors, we can expect to see a potential dementia tsunami in the future. The good news is that cognitive decline can be managed.” Prof Feng, who is from NUS’ Department of Psychological Medicine, said people with mild cognitive impairment can still perform most normal functions, and that the rate of decline can be slowed through dietary and other lifestyle interventions. Tests showed that this group had lower levels of ergothioneine in their bloodstreams, which also correlated with their lower intake of mushrooms. Prof Feng added that the researchers plan to conduct a clinical trial on the potential benefits of pure ergothioneine alone or in combination with other nutrients derived from plants in delaying cognitive decline. If it is successful, the research could lead to the development of a supplement in future.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
"New poll finds many US adults feel lonely, especially those in poor health",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/326640/new-poll-finds-many-us-adults-feel-lonely-especially-those-in-poor-health/,"05:39 PM March 06, 2019","A new U.S. poll has revealed that as many as a quarter of U.S. adults feel isolated at least some of the time, with those who have health issues feeling even lonelier than those who rate their wellbeing more highly. The National Poll on Healthy Aging, carried out by researchers at the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, and sponsored by AARP and Michigan Medicine, U-M’s academic medical center, was administered to 2,051 American adults aged 50 to 80 years. Participants were asked about their overall physical and mental health, their feelings of loneliness, isolation, and contact with friends and family, as well more specific questions about health such as diet, exercise, and whether they wear a hearing aid. The findings showed that one in four felt isolated from others at some point, with a third reporting that they lack regular companionship. Moreover, those who reported poor or fair physical or mental health, had an unhealthier lifestyle, and who wore a hearing aid were more likely to report being lonely or lacking companions than those who said they ate healthy diets, exercised, got enough sleep or didn’t smoke. Specifically, 26 percent of respondents who said they lacked companionship also reported being in fair or poor physical health, compared to 13 percent of those who said they hardly ever lacked companionship. 17 percent of those who felt isolated had fair or poor mental health, compared to just 2 percent of those who hardly ever felt isolated. In addition, one in five of those who reported feeling isolated said they had fair or poor hearing, compared to around one in 10 of those who said they hardly ever feel isolated. Those who were unemployed, lived in lower-income households, lived alone and/or had one or more children living with them were also more likely to say they lacked companionship, while 60 percent of those living alone reported feeling a lack of companionship, and 41 percent felt isolated. “More than a quarter of poll respondents said they only had social contact once a week, or less, with family members they don’t live with, or with friends and neighbors,” said Erica Solway, PhD, co-director of the poll. “These results indicate the importance of proactively reaching out to those in your community who may be at risk of feeling isolated and disconnected, especially those with or at risk of health issues.” Poll director Preeti Malani, MD, noted that there is growing evidence to suggest that health and loneliness are connected, and that reducing loneliness through volunteering, taking part in religious or community groups, and other activities can positively impact health. “As we grow older, and mobility or hearing becomes more of a barrier, the poll data show the importance of maintaining and strengthening our ties to other people,” said Malani. “It also suggests that caregivers, spouses and partners, adult children and others involved in older adults’ lives have a role to play in encouraging and facilitating these connections.” NVG RELATED STORIES: Cutting down social media use may help reduce depression, loneliness Loneliness peaks in the 20s, 50s and 80s—study  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
"Poor diet low in fruit and veggies, high in junk food linked with increased risk of mental illness",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/325591/p2fb-poor-diet-low-in-fruit-and-veggies-and-high-in-junk-food-linked-with-increased-risk-of-mental-illness/,"04:38 PM February 25, 2019","New United States research has found that eating a poor diet low in nutrients may be associated with an increased risk of developing mental health problems. Carried out by researchers at the Loma Linda University School of Public Health in California, the new looked at data gathered from 245,891 telephone surveys conducted between 2005 and 2015 which included in-depth information on participants’ socio-demographics, health status and health behaviors. The findings, published in the International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition, showed that adults who ate more unhealthy food, such as a lower consumption of fruits and vegetables and an increased consumption of French fries, fast food and soda, were more likely to report symptoms of either moderate or severe psychological distress than those who ate a healthier diet. The results also held true even after taking into account factors such as gender age, education, age, marital status and income level. Lead author Jim E. Banta, Ph.D., MPH, commented on the findings, saying that they are in-line with those from other studies carried out in other countries, which have also found a link between a poor diet and mental illness. For example, a high sugar intake has been linked with bipolar disorder, and fried foods linked with depression. Banta added that the new findings cannot establish cause and effect between poor diet and mental illness and further research is still needed, although the team added that the findings provide “additional evidence that public policy and clinical practice should more explicitly aim to improve diet quality among those struggling with mental health.” “This and other studies like it could have big implications for treatments in behavioral medicine,” said Banta, “Perhaps the time has come for us to take a closer look at the role of diet in mental health, because it could be that healthy diet choices contribute to mental health. More research is needed before we can answer definitively, but the evidence seems to be pointing in that direction.” JB RELATED STORIES: Diet drinks could increase risk of stroke for post-menopausal women  Eating nuts linked to improved heart health for those with diabetes   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
Healthy diet linked to reduced symptoms of depression,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/323978/p2fb-healthy-diet-linked-to-reduced-symptoms-of-depression/,"05:23 PM February 10, 2019","New United Kingdom research has found that improving your diet could also improve symptoms of depression. Carried out by researchers at the University of Manchester, the new study looked at 16 randomized controlled trials with a total of 45,826 participants to investigate the association between making dietary improvements and symptoms of depression and anxiety. The findings, published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, showed that all types of dietary improvement, including those designed for weight loss, fat reduction or to increase nutrients, appeared to have an equally beneficial effect on reducing the symptoms of depression, even in those without diagnosed depressive disorders. Moreover, when dietary improvements were combined with exercise, the positive effect was even stronger. However, the researchers could not determine a clear relationship between diet and anxiety, although they did find that female participants who improved their diet appeared to benefit from even greater improvements for symptoms of both depression and anxiety. “The overall evidence for the effects of diet on mood and mental well-being had up to now yet to be assessed,” said study author Dr. Joseph Firth. “But our recent meta-analysis has done just that; showing that adopting a healthier diet can boost people’s mood. However, it has no clear effects on anxiety.” “The similar effects from any type of dietary improvement suggests that highly-specific or specialized diets are unnecessary for the average individual,” continued Dr. Firth, “Instead, just making simple changes is equally beneficial for mental health. In particular, eating more nutrient-dense meals which are high in fiber and vegetables, while cutting back on fast-foods and refined sugars appears to be sufficient for avoiding the potentially negative psychological effects of a ‘junk food’ diet.” “We’re not yet sure why not know why some of our data showed significantly greater benefits from diets for women. So more research is needed on this. And we also need to establish how the benefits of a healthy diet are related to improvements in physical health. It could be through reducing obesity, inflammation or fatigue, all of which are linked to diet and impact upon mental health,” added Dr. Firth. Another recent U.K. study, this time from the University of Leeds, also found that increasing fruit and vegetable intake could help boost mental well-being. After looking at data from more than 40,000 participants, the team found that eating just one extra portion of fruits and vegetables a day appeared to have an effect on mental well-being equivalent to completing around eight extra days of walking a month, defined as walking for at least 10 minutes at a time.

5 simple but healthy habits to start this January,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320368/p2fb-5-simple-but-healthy-habits-to-start-this-january/,"11:14 PM January 07, 2019","If you want to boost your health in 2019 but resolutions seem too daunting, then read on for five easy ways to improve well-being each day and throughout the coming year. Cut out soda Even making small diet changes can boost health, and cutting out soda and other sweetened beverages is one of the biggest small changes you can make, reducing both calorie intake and sugar consumption. A high intake of sugary drinks has been linked with a variety of health problems including increased risk of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lower chance of getting pregnant, an increase in visceral fat (the type of fat that wraps around internal organs such as the liver, pancreas and intestines) and even an increased risk of death. Walk more If the thought of a gym membership or marathon training is too big a fitness goal, simply walking more will still bring benefits for health. One study found that walking at least four hours a week, or just 35 minutes a day, may reduce the severity of a stroke, and walking to work has been linked with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, with an even lower risk for those who also walk in their leisure time. Picking up the pace can also bring extra benefits, with walking at an average pace linked to a 20 percent lower risk for all-cause mortality compared with walking at a slow pace, and walking at a brisk or fast pace reducing the risk even further, by 24 percent. Get some daylight Getting enough natural daylight has previously been linked with a lower risk of depression, a lower risk of post-natal depression in women, and more recently with improved eye health. Previous research has suggested that getting outdoors in the morning is most beneficial; those who struggle to get outside are advised to open the curtains at home and sit by windows in offices to try to maximize the amount of light, or use light therapy lamps to help fight depression in winter months. Enjoy a massage A massage is a great way to help you de-stress, which is important for health, but recent research is suggesting the benefits may go further than simply helping us to relax. A recent study also linked regular massages with improved arthritis symptoms, while a study published back in 2014 also suggested that shiatsu massage could aid sleep. So if you choose just one way to improve health this year, booking yourself in for a massage might be the most enjoyable one. Visit blue and green spaces If you live in the countryside this one is easier, but even in a city most of us have access to blue spaces, such as lakes and rivers, and green spaces, including parks and nearby forests. Taking in these locations can not only help you also get more active through walking, but many recent studies are uncovering a variety of benefits of being near nature and natural space, including fewer respiratory problems, reduced risk of breast cancer in women, improved mental health and a lower risk of depression, and improved overall well-being.

Millennial men value good health more than physical strength,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/316106/millennial-men-value-good-health-more-than-physical-strength/,"03:22 PM December 04, 2018","The definition of masculinity has been shifting over the years. A recent study showed just how much “macho” has been shaved off the modern view of what it is to be a man. The study, published in the journal Psychology of Men & Masculinity, found that millennial men favored staying in good health and being open as their top priorities. This is a big contrast to previous generations whose key values are being stoic, independent and physically capable, as reported by DailyMail. Participants in the study–conducted by Nick Black, managing partner at Intentions Consulting; and lead author John Oliffe, a nursing professor–included 630 men aged 15 to 29 from Canada. The researchers noted that the men felt unsure and uncomfortable being asked for their definition of “masculinity.” Black said the participants “squirmed” at the idea of splitting things into male and female. Once the participants got over the initial questions, the interviews showed that 88 percent of the men prized openness as the most desirable trait. This was followed by intellect (87 percent) then fitness and health (86.5 percent). The trait of openness surprised the researchers. To their defense, the men said that the traditional idea of being stoic and “macho” put them at a disadvantage both socially and professionally. On the other hand, openness and a good well-being gave them opportunities to build networks and thrive. Even more so, financial success was no longer a defining factor. The men believed women would rather look at their intellect and emotional strength than their bank account. On the other hand, the same men also expressed doubt they would achieve financial success. Then again they were also unconvinced that money alone would define them as a person. While the participants of the study were all Canadian, other studies showed similar results, which helped to reinforce the idea that the millennial man’s idea of masculinity is a far cry from their fathers and grandfathers, according to the report. “As gender roles have become more equal, men [were more concerned] about taking care of themselves and being physically attractive,” said Black. Thanks to this trend, the traditional definition of “masculinity” is increasingly being seen as a narrow concept. Psychologist Jennifer K Bosson noted in her study that some men feel the pressure of the narrow version of masculinity very acutely. Black also noted that Western cultures tend to have a binary, black-and-white view on many things. The shift to a less rigid concept of masculinity could greatly affect the mental and physical health of men moving forward. Black said, “I think it’s important that we give young men permission to step into those roles.”  Alfred Bayle /ra  RELATED STORIES: Low-carb diet helps maintain weight loss – study Plant-based diets are most effective for controlling type 2 diabetes Higher levels of vitamin D linked to improved cardiorespiratory fitness  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
More or less than 6 to 8 hours sleep a night could be bad for health — new research,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/304320/p2fb-more-or-less-than-6-to-8-hours-sleep-a-night-could-be-bad-for-health-new-research/,"07:38 PM August 28, 2018","New research presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2018 has suggested that around six to eight hours sleep a night could be ideal for maintaining good health, with more or less shut-eye appearing to have a negative effect on well-being. In the first of three studies presented at the event, researchers at the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Centre, Greece, carried out a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between sleep duration and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), looking at 11 studies with a total of 1,000,541 adults without CVD. They found that compared to those who slept six to eight hours a night, short sleepers who slept less than six hours per night had an 11 percent increased risk of developing or dying from coronary artery disease or stroke during an average follow-up of 9.3 years. For long sleepers, defined as those who slept more than eight hours per night, this number rose to a 33 percent increased risk. “Our findings suggest that too much or too little sleep may be bad for the heart,” said study author Dr. Epameinondas Fountas. “More research is needed to clarify exactly why, but we do know that sleep influences biological processes like glucose metabolism, blood pressure and inflammation, all of which have an impact on cardiovascular disease.” “Having the odd short night or lie-in is unlikely to be detrimental to health, but evidence is accumulating that prolonged nightly sleep deprivation or excessive sleeping should be avoided,” added Dr. Fountas. “Getting the right amount of sleep is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.” Research from the Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC) in Madrid, which was also presented at the congress, adds to the evidence that too little sleep may have a negative effect on health. After recording the sleep of 3,974 healthy middle-aged adults over a seven-day period, the researchers found that those who sleep less than six hours a night or wake up several times in the night have an increased risk of asymptomatic atherosclerosis, which hardens and narrows the arteries, than those who sleep seven to eight hours a night or wake up less often. Those who had short or disrupted sleep were also more likely to have metabolic syndrome, a collection of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure and obesity, which can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Findings presented by the University of Gothenburg, Sweden also found that middle-aged men who slept less than five hours a night had twice the risk of a major cardiovascular event during the study’s 21-year follow-up than men who sleep seven to eight hours. In addition, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, low physical activity and poor sleep quality were also more common in men who slept five or less per night compared to those who got seven to eight hours. The ESC Congress 2018 takes place Saturday, Aug. 25 through Wednesday, Aug. 29 in Munich, Germany.

More than eight hours of shut-eye is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death, compared to sleeping less than seven hours. Led by researchers from Keele University, along with colleagues at the University of Manchester, the University of Leeds and the University of East Anglia, the new analysis looked at 74 studies which investigated the link between sleep duration and sleep quality and the risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease. Together, the studies included 3, 340, 684 participants who self-reported their sleep duration. The researchers found that participants who reported sleeping for more than eight hours a night had a greater mortality and cardiovascular risk than those who slept for less than seven hours. A sleep duration of ten hours a night was linked with a 30 percent increased risk of dying compared to sleeping for seven hours, a 56 percent increased risk of dying from a stroke and a 49 percent increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. In addition, poor-quality sleep was associated with a 44 percent increase in coronary heart disease. Lead researcher Dr. Chun Shing Kwok said, “Sleep affects everyone. The amount and quality of our sleep is complex. There are cultural, social, psychological, behavioral, pathophysiological and environmental influences on our sleep such as the need to care for children or family members, irregular working shift patterns, physical or mental illness, and the 24-hour availability of commodities in modern society.” “This research began because we were interested to know if it was more harmful to sleep below or beyond the recommended sleep duration of seven to eight hours. We further wanted to know how incremental deviation from recommended sleep duration altered risk of mortality and cardiovascular risk.” “Our study has an important public health impact in that it shows that excessive sleep is a marker of elevated cardiovascular risk.” “Our findings have important implications as clinicians should have greater consideration for exploring sleep duration and quality during consultations. If excessive sleep patterns are found, particularly prolonged durations of eight hours or more, then clinicians should consider screening for adverse cardiovascular risk factors and obstructive sleep apnea, which is a serious sleep disorder that occurs when a person’s breathing is interrupted during sleep.” The results were published in the Journal of the American Heart Association. MKH RELATED STORIES: How to set a healthy sleep schedule for the whole family Natural early birds may have lower risk of depression  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
Does the time you eat dinner have an effect on your health?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/300648/p2fb-does-the-time-you-eat-dinner-have-an-effect-on-your-health/,"11:08 PM July 19, 2018","New Spanish research has found that eating your evening meal earlier, or leaving an interval of at least two hours before going to bed, is linked with a lower risk of breast and prostate cancer. Carried out by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), a center supported by the la Caixa Banking Foundation, the new study looked at 621 patients with prostate cancer and 1,205 with breast cancer as well as 872 male and 1,321 female control participants to see if the timing of meals was associated with risk of the two cancers. The researchers interviewed the participants on timing of meals, sleep and chronotype, which is whether an individual shows a natural preference for morning or evening activity. Participants were also asked to complete a Food Frequency Questionnaire to look at their dietary habits and adherence to cancer prevention recommendations. The results showed that participants who waited two or more hours after dinner before sleeping had around a 20 percent lower risk of breast or prostate cancer compared with subjects who slept immediately after. Eating dinner before 9 p.m. also had a similar protective effect when compared with eating the evening meal after 10 p.m. The positive effect of leaving a longer interval between dinner and sleep was also more pronounced among participants who adhered to cancer prevention recommendations and in those who were morning types. The study is the first to analyze the association between cancer risk and the timing of meals and sleep, with previous research focusing instead on dietary patterns, for example, the effects of eating red meat, fruit and vegetables and the associations between food intake and obesity, rather than the timing of food. “Our study concludes that adherence to diurnal eating patterns is associated with a lower risk of cancer,” commented lead author Manolis Kogevinas, adding that the findings “highlight the importance of assessing circadian rhythms in studies on diet and cancer.” Dora Romaguera, the last author of the study, also noted, “Further research in humans is needed in order to understand the reasons behind these findings, but everything seems to indicate that the timing of sleep affects our capacity to metabolize food. Animal experimental evidence has shown that the timing of food intake has “profound implications for food metabolism and health.” If the findings are confirmed, Kogevinas added, “They will have implications for cancer prevention recommendations, which currently do not take meal timing into account. The impact could be especially important in cultures such as those of southern Europe, where people have supper late.” The results can be found published online in the International Journal of Cancer.

Psychology grad recounts 3-year struggle with mental illness acceptance,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/299629/p2fb-psychology-graduate-tells-her-three-year-struggle-with-mental-illness-acceptance/,"04:05 PM July 08, 2018","In a country where there is prevailing stigma and discrimination against mental illnesses, admitting one is suffering from a mental illness is most probably a hard pill to swallow. But after President Rodrigo Duterte signed the Mental Health Law, Psychology graduate, Zildjian Athelstane Velasco Yaneza, finally mustered the courage to share her three-year journey of accepting her mental health condition. “Finally. It took 3 years – to muster up the courage to stand for my needs, and for myself. It took 3 years – to accept, to learn. It took 3 years – to honor my weakness as my strength,” said Yaneza in a Facebook post she made Friday, July 6, which has gone viral. The post has garnered about 9,900 likes, 4,100 shares and over 800 comments, as of this writing. Yaneza recalled the first time she was diagnosed with a mental illness in December 2014: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). She shared her experience of bringing herself at the Out Patient Department (OPD) of the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Medicine in University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH), after months of sleeplessness and restlessness, coupled with anxiety attacks. After her diagnosis, she was given the prescription medicine she needed. However, she thought she can get by without her medication, so she refused to take them. That was when things got a little more problematic for her. “I started self-harming: I cut my wrists, I let it bleed. Paranoia, delusion. I wanted to die. I prayed hard for Him to claim my life. My thoughts were becoming [obsessed] on the thoughts of dying; I got tired of pleasing everyone, of being not good enough, of not meeting the ‘standards.’ The crippling thoughts and anxiety overwhelmed me.” She was once again rushed to UP-PGH in May 2015, where she stayed for ten days in the psychiatry ward. She said that she did not tell anyone about her confinement because she was afraid of the stigma associated with it. It was during that time that she was diagnosed with “Bipolar Type 1 Disorder Most Recent Episode (MRE) Manic with psychotic episode, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) traits and PTSD.” “I can remember how I cried a lot because I literally had no sleep for straight 9 days while still attending class, and dealing with a lot of shit talk from some of my classmates, abusive ex-partner etc,” said Yaneza. “It took its toll on me. It’s bad when you expect from people whom you thought would understand you play the ‘ignorant’ card and say they didn’t know such a thing when all along, they are the reason for it. I understand the resistance of my loved ones from accepting what I’m currently facing, because [to be honest], I myself had a hard time dealing with it.” Yaneza admitted that she made an attempt to end her life last month. She later realized that suicide is never the answer. The Psychology graduate doubted herself and stated she lost her self-esteem along the way: “Sobrang taba ko na daw eh, ‘di na maganda?? Ha ha. Pakiramdam ko wala akong karapatang mahalin ng tao kasi wala akong kwenta. Na wala akong silbi. Na wala akong mapatunayan. Na wala lang ako.” (They say I’m too fat [because of the medications] and that I’m no longer beautiful? I felt as if I am no longer deserving of being loved because I am worthless. That I am useless. That I have nothing to prove. That I am a nobody.) Yaneza also laments over the use of the word “bipolar” as an adjective and even as a joke, as it undermines the real meaning of the word. “Mahirap piliin mabuhay kung ang nakikita mong lahat ng rason sa paligid mo eh gusto mo na lang mawala,” she said. (It’s hard making the choice to live when all you can see are reasons for you not to.) “I always complain whenever I wake up from a trance sleep ‘cause I wish I didn’t. It’s a constant battle of living and leaving,” added. The Psychiatry student also shares the comments associated with mental illness that she had to face: “Eh paano yan bipolar ka? Paano mo magagawang mag-doctor?/ ‘Di ka makakakuha ng trabaho kasi may saltik ka/ Nakikinabang ka lang naman sa iba eh/ Choice mo naman yan eh/ Hindi ka ba naaawa sa mga taong nasa paligid mo?” (How can you become a doctor when you are bipolar?/You won’t get a job because you’re crazy/ You’re only benefitting from other people/ It’s your choice, anyway/ Don’t you feel pity for the people around you?) Yaneza then shared her biggest learnings throughout her three-year struggle with mental illness acceptance: she stresses that mental health is equally as important as physical health, that having a mental illness is not a choice, and that suicide is not the answer as help is available for those who need it.  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211708901027092&set=a.2812453919547.2115883.1504749911&type=3&ifg=1dfghjk Yaneza’s awareness and acceptance of her condition reflects the growing concern of various actions of organizations in reaching out to mental health patients like her. The Youth for Mental Health Coalition Inc., for one, is inviting interested applicants to join the youth team who will draft the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 11036 or the Philippine Mental Health Law. Filipino youth who are interested may join the coalition’s consultation group. JB RELATED STORIES: ‘13 Reasons Why’—Does it promote mental health awareness or glorify suicide and depression?

World Bicycle Day 2018: Why we should all get on our bikes to boost health,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/296294/p2fb-world-bicycle-day-2018-get-bikes-boost-health/,"06:44 PM June 03, 2018"," Sunday, June 3 is World Bicycle Day 2018, organized by the United Nations to celebrate the bicycle as a “simple, affordable, reliable, clean and environmentally fit” method of transport, which of course also brings many health benefits. Here we round up some recent research which shows how swapping the car for the humble bike could give our health a big boost. Improved mood and reduced stress A small Canadian study published last year found that cycling to work can help get your day off to a better start, with those who commuted to work on their bike arriving in a better mood and with a lower level of stress than those who took the car. This positive effect also helped cyclists have a better day in general, reducing stress and even boosting work performance. A lower risk of heart disease United Kingdom research published earlier this year found that cycling or walking to work could help cut the risk of developing or dying from cardiovascular disease (CVD) or stroke. The large-scale study looked at over 350,000 participants to find that regular commuters who used a more active means of travel for commuting, such as cycling, had an 11 percent lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 30 percent lower risk of fatal CVD. Regular commuters who cycled in their spare time had a 43 percent lower risk of fatal CVD. Even those who were not regular commuters but took the bike occasionally saw benefits, showing an 8 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality. Reduced risk of type 2 diabetes A large-scale study carried out by the University of Southern Denmark found that cycling can help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. After looking at 24,623 men and 27,890 women, researchers found that those who cycled regularly were less likely to develop type 2 diabetes, and the more they cycled each week, the lower the risk was. The results also indicated that even those who took up regular cycling at a later age still benefited from a 20 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than non-cyclists. It can help keep off extra weight U.K. researchers who compared the daily modes of transport of nearly 150,000 participants found that cycling was one of the most effective forms of exercise for keeping trim and losing weight and was even more effective than walking. Those who cycled to work had lower BMIs than those who walked, drove, or took public transport and lower levels of body fat than those who took public transport or the car. It’s safe for sexual health Two separate studies published earlier this year found that cycling does not affect a man’s sexual or urinary health or a woman’s gynecological health. The first, carried out by the University of California, found that male cyclists’ sexual and urinary health was no worse than swimmers’ or runners’, although adjusting the handlebar height to be higher or even with the saddle reduced the chance of genital numbness and saddle sores. Researchers from UC San Francisco also found that although female cyclists had a higher risk of genital numbness and saddle sores than non-cyclists, as well as a higher risk of urinary tract infections, they showed no worse sexual or urinary function, and in fact high-intensity cyclists may benefit from improved sexual function.

"Vending machine dispenses ‘snacks’ based on your emotional, mental needs",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/290292/vending-machine-dispenses-snacks-based-on-your-emotional-mental-needs-p2fb/,"03:23 PM March 29, 2018","Next time you gorge on a packet of chocolate cookies or potato chips from the vending machine, perhaps it wouldn’t hurt to consider if what you really need is processed empty calories or a sense of purpose, as well as a new perspective. Artists Elizabeth Commandeur and Mark Starmach’s brainchild, “Intangible Goods”, may just help you there. Intangible Goods is a vending machine filled with “conveniently-packaged consumables for the mind”, and is currently a part of a lineup of installation artworks for Art & About Sydney, held in Sydney, Australia’s central business district. Instead of protein bars and energy drinks, however, bars and packets of “reassurance,” “friendship,” “belonging” and “purpose” are available for consumption. Perhaps you need a dose of reassurance before heading to your next meeting? A sense of belongingness when going to a family reunion for the first time in years, or even a taste of friendship? The packets themselves don’t contain food, but instead consists of sundries like pencils, written notes and prompts, maps, even origami works — all for the purpose of leveling up one’s emotional and mental health. “Intangible Goods” was “developed in collaboration with mental health professionals and presented by Art & About Sydney; each good is designed to momentarily satisfy a need higher up on Maslow’s hierarchy than, say, chocolate and crinkle-cut chips.” It’s an art project that seems ostensibly quirky, but actually goes deeper into the surface to bring mental health advocacy to the fore. As the “Intangible Goods” installation runs from March 26 to April 8 in Sydney, all of its profits will be donated to beyondblue, the Mental Health Association NSW (WayAhead), as well as the Schizophrenia Research Institute at NeuRA.

How man’s best friend could improve your health in the Year of the Dog,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/286843/p2fb-chinese-new-year-2018-mans-best-friend-improve-health-year-dog/,"03:07 PM February 18, 2018","In celebration of man’s best friend, here we round up how your furry friend could give your health a boost this Year of the Dog. Reduced risk of allergies Various studies have now found a link between owning a dog and a lower risk of allergies, especially in children. Research presented last year at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting detailed how children of mothers who had been in daily contact with a dog while pregnant had a lower risk of eczema by age two, and that pet dogs could also have a protective effect against asthma symptoms. Swedish researchers also found after looking at more than one million Swedish children that those who grew up with dogs had a 15 percent lower risk of asthma. Better sleep A small United States study found that despite a dog’s snoring, sleeping with your pooch could actually help you get a better night’s sleep. After recruiting 40 adults and their pets for the study, researchers at the Mayo Clinic found that regardless of the size of the dog, sleeping with a furry friend in the room helped some people sleep better. However, having a dog on the bed didn’t have the same effect, with the team finding that those who let their canines get too cozy did it at the expense of a good night’s sleep. “Most people assume having pets in the bedroom is a disruption. We found that many people actually find comfort and a sense of security from sleeping with their pets,” commented the study’s author Lois Krahn, M.D. Improved mental health After looking at 17 research papers, a United Kingdom review published just this week found that having a pet could have a positive effect on managing long-term mental health conditions. Owning a dog, or other animal such as a cat, goldfish or hamster, was found to be beneficial by helping to distract owners from the stress of having a mental health problem and helping to alleviate feelings of loneliness. Dogs also had the added benefit of helping owners increase their level of physical activity through walking, which in turn can also help improve mental health and encourage social interaction with other dog owners. Pet dogs have also been found to help support children when they are stressed, while a 2015 U.S. study found that children who have a dog at home also have a lower level of anxiety than those who do not. More exercise It can be hard to find the motivation to get moving sometimes, but most dog owners will tell you you don’t have much choice if your dog is asking for walks. Many recent studies have also found that those with a dog do indeed get more exercise, with a dog being especially beneficial for helping seniors to get out of the house and get moving. A U.K. study published last year found that seniors who walk their dogs clock up around 30 minutes more physical activity a day than non-dog owners, even during the colder, wetter months. An Australian study also found that dog walkers achieved at least 30 minutes of physical activity on more days per week than non-dog walkers, helping them to meet the 150 minutes of physical activity per week currently recommended for good health.

Family meals could give children healthy eating habits for life,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/284893/family-meals-could-give-children-healthy-eating-habits-for-life/,"06:55 PM January 23, 2018","New European research has found that regularly eating together as a family helps pass healthy eating habits onto children that last well into adulthood, potentially preventing obesity later in life. Carried out by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and the University of Mannheim, Germany, the new meta-analysis looked at 57 studies which together included a total of 203,706 of participants from across the world. The team analyzed the relationship between family meals and children’s nutritional health using the measurements of body mass index (BMI), the number of portions of fruit and vegetables eaten per day (as an indicator of healthy diet), and the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, fast food, and salty snacks (as indicators of an unhealthy diet). The researchers found that frequent family meals are associated with lower body mass index (BMI) and a healthy diet in children, with the relationship found across all countries and all ages. The positive finding also held true whether meals were taken with just one parent or the whole family. “Childhood is a unique window of opportunity for countering detrimental eating and lifestyle habits,” commented lead author Mattea Dallacker. “Parents act as ‘nutritional gatekeepers’ in that they have a substantial influence on when, what, and how much children eat. So family meals offer a rich learning environment for setting up healthy eating habits in children.” Co-author Jutta Mata also added that, “The current research indicates that it’s not just the quality of food that’s important, but that psychological and behavioral factors also play a role. For example, mealtime routines such as positive parental role modeling or a pleasant atmosphere could improve children’s eating habits.” However, for parents struggling to get the whole family together for meal times, or consistently provide home-cooked dinners, co-author Ralph Hertwig noted that children could still learn this healthy habits from others. “Given the increasing trend for both parents to work, putting regular family meals on the table is a daily challenge for many families. In this context, it’s important to note that initial findings indicate that other communal meals, such as school lunches, can also have positive effects on children’s eating habits. For instance, one study showed that teachers can also serve as positive role models when eating together with their students.” The results can be found published online in the journal Obesity Reviews.

"Cycling doesn’t affect men’s sexual or urinary health, says new study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/284224/p2fb-cycling-doesnt-affect-mens-sexual-urinary-health-says-new-study/,"06:22 PM January 13, 2018","A new study has found that contrary to popular belief, cycling does not negatively affect sexual or urinary health in men, with researchers concluding that the cardiovascular benefits gained from the sport outweigh any potential risks. Carried out by the Department of Urology, University of California-San Francisco, the multinational study looked at a cross-section of three athletic groups (cyclists, swimmers and runners) to look at the effect of the sports on urinary and sexual function in men. Previous studies have suggested that cycling can negatively affect erectile function by putting prolonged pressure on the perineum and causing micro-trauma. However, the team behind the new research noted that these studies were limited by small sample sizes and a failure to use validated measures or comparison groups, with lead investigator Benjamin Breyer adding that the new research, “is the largest comparative study to date, exploring the associations of cycling, bike and road characteristics with sexual and urinary function using validated questionnaires.” For the study the team recruited 2,774 cyclists, 539 swimmers, and 789 runners and asked participants to complete validated questionnaires about sexual health and urinary tract infections (UTIs) and answer questions on genital numbness, saddle sores, and urethral strictures, which is when a scar from swelling, injury or infection blocks or slows the flow of urine in the urethra. Cyclists were also asked about cycling intensity, bicycle configuration, bike type, saddle type, saddle angle, frequency of wearing padded shorts while cycling, percent of time standing out of the saddle, handlebar height, and the type of surface on which they usually ride. Non-cyclists were defined as those who swim and/or run but do not cycle on a regular basis. The team found that in general, cyclists’ sexual and urinary health was no worse than swimmers’ or runners’, although cyclists were more prone to urethral strictures. In addition, they also found that standing more than 20 percent of the time while cycling significantly reduced the odds of genital numbness, and adjusting the handlebar height to be higher or even with the saddle also reduced the chance of genital numbness and saddle sores. However, no other bicycle nor road characteristics were found to have a negative impact on cyclists. As cycling grows in popularity for both commuting and leisure reasons, Breyer commented that, “We believe the results will be encouraging for cyclists. Cycling provides tremendous cardiovascular benefits and is low impact on joints. We believe the health benefits enjoyed by cyclists who ride safely will far outweigh health risks.” The findings can be found published online in The Journal of Urology.

Broadcaster ITV pulled its most popular daytime show “The Jeremy Kyle Show” off air indefinitely following the death of 63-year-old Steve Dymond, a week after he appeared on an episode. Dymond failed a lie-detector test taken on the show to convince his fiancee he had not cheated on her, leading to the couple splitting up, The Sun newspaper reported. The show has been the focus of criticism over its confrontational style, which often pits romantic rivals against each other and has previously descended into violence. Conservative MP Charles Walker told the Daily Mail that ITV “would be best advised just to stop” the show permanently. “It’s a very, very unattractive TV show and I’m surprised it’s gone on so long,” he added. Manchester judge Alan Berg described the show in 2007 as a “morbid and depressing display of dysfunctional people whose lives are in turmoil,” calling it “human bear-baiting.” ITV wiped all episodes from its on-demand service the ITV Hub, and episodes will not air on ITV2. The show, which attracts around one million viewers per episode, is hosted by former insurance salesman Kyle and has run since 2005. The mental health consequences of reality TV shows has been in the spotlight in Britain following the deaths of two contestants on hit show “Love Island”.

‘Blind makeup’ method brightens women’s lives,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/294272/blind-makeup-method-brightens-womens-lives/,"07:46 PM May 14, 2018","  A makeup method dubbed “blind makeup” for visually impaired women is attracting attention as a way to care for their mental health, with women who receive the training finding it boosts their sense of confidence.  The method was devised by Kaho Oishi, a 52-year-old research fellow of Nihon Fukushi University in Aichi Prefecture, who lives in Osaka. Oishi established a private organization called Caremake Association and a certification system for trainers who teach the makeup method. In January this year, 10 people — mainly volunteers who support visually impaired people — were certified as trainers. The organization also aims to popularize the method overseas.  To this end, an event is planned in China this autumn. According to research by the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry, there were about 340,000 visually handicapped people across Japan as of the end of fiscal 2016. In many cases, women with visual impairments are hesitant about going out because they cannot do their makeup well.  Oishi, whose area of expertise is the welfare of the handicapped, therefore devised the makeup method in 2010. A visually impaired woman applying powder-based foundation with a brush will use her right hand to apply the foundation on the right side of her face, and her left hand for the left side of her face. The makeup is applied symmetrically, moving the brush down the face — from the forehead, to the corner of each eye, to the cheek, and so on — in outward strokes.  When the woman uses lipstick, she first puts the color on the tips of the little fingers of both hands, and then applies it to her lips. Starting in the center of the upper lip, the color is applied outward to the right and left, then from the corners of the lips around to the center of the lower lip. To acquire these skills, 10 to 20 hours of training is necessary.  Caremake Association was established in 2016 and is based in Osaka. Through the association, Oishi has instructed about 200 visually handicapped women in the method across the nation, including in Tokyo and Aichi Prefecture. The association also created a certification for trainers and has given practical training sessions.  Sakura Ophthalmologic Clinic in Shizuoka introduced the makeup method in 2016 for women who were not born blind. Four staff members of the clinic obtained the certification. Clinic head Atsuko Matsuhisa, 62, said, “After receiving instructions on the makeup method, people’s facial expressions became so bright that they looked like different people.”  One blind woman in Osaka went to Tokyo alone for the first time in her life after being instructed on the makeup method by Oishi. She went to declare her love to a man, and the couple decided to marry. In February, nine blind women, including the Osaka woman, formed a volunteer team to popularize the makeup method overseas, because there are few such initiatives abroad. The team will hold an event in China on Oct. 10, where they will demonstrate how to apply makeup using the blind method and talk about their experiences.   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018

The first 15 minutes, shot in a way that unsuspecting viewers would think they’re about to watch another concert documentary, ends up chronicling the turbulent end of her 2016 Revival Tour, which was canceled after 55 performances because of her deteriorating mental health. And we’re given a clear view of how dark that period was for her. “At one point, she was like ‘I don’t want to be alive right now. I don’t want to live,’” says her former assistant. After that, the documentary shows Gomez ambling her way to recovery while managing an extremely public life as a pop star. From discussing with her team on whether or not to publicize her bipolar disorder and struggling with her nerves as she made her American Music Awards comeback with “Lose You to Love Me” and “Look at Her Now” (and watched as critics mercilessly tore her performance) to her getting increasingly more upset as she did promo after promo where interviewers either didn’t understand her, weren’t listening, or wasted her time.  But there’s also a bright lifeline in the form of her philanthropic work with WE Charity in Kenya, but even that rug was pulled from under her when the charity went under investigation. And of course, she’s balancing all that along with her struggles with lupus, the autoimmune disease she’s been battling all her life. In 2015, she spoke about having the paparazzi and tabloids accuse her of being a drug addict and that she was going on a hiatus to go to rehab—as if there was anything wrong about it in the first place—when in reality she was taking a break to undergo chemotherapy. Throughout the documentary, we see how much the paparazzi continues to abuse her. She says it best: “It’s hard being a fucking girl and being crazy already.” This is the rawest we’ve ever seen Gomez. Throughout multiple points of the documentary, we see her break down and cry, be afraid of her own psychosis, and apologize for the person she becomes when she’s not in control. “I want nothing more than to not be my past,” she says near the beginning and echoes through the film, which is heartbreaking. “Everything I ever wished for, I’ve had and done all of it,” she says. “But it has killed me. Because there is always Selena.” The documentary was made by Alek Keshishian, the same mind behind the seminal 1991 Madonna concert documentary “Madonna: Truth or Dare.” In Rolling Stone’s recent profile on Gomez, he talks about the singer giving him full control and access to her life, and how the film became a concert docu to what it is now. He saw “a deeper documentary here about a young woman struggling to incorporate her diagnosis—she was fresh out of the mental facility—and trying to reconcile the fact that she’s still a patient, she’s still in the earliest stages of her recovery, but she desperately wants to use her platform for good and to talk about it. There’s some tension there because obviously she’s trying to be an example for others, but she’s still not on the other side of it, so to speak.” It also has some potent, powerful imagery. Some shots, when Gomez is narrating lines from her diary that show exactly how dark a place her brain was, have the pop star made up like a calaveras de azúcar, a symbol for the Mexican Dia de los Muertos. There’s something so evocative about seeing her claim her culture while showing how much she’s fought.  The singer also released a single called “My Mind and Me” to go alongside the documentary’s release. With lyrics like “I’m constantly fighting something that my eyes can’t see,” and “but if I pull back the curtain, maybe someone who’s hurting will be a little more certain they’re not the only one lost” and a chorus that goes “my mind and me, we don’t get along sometimes,” it’s a good companion piece that continues to elucidate the docu’s thesis. One thing “My Mind and Me” also makes clear is how much Gomez wants to be a safe place for people who are struggling like her. When she’s done with music and acting and the celebrity lifestyle, she tells an interviewer, what she really wants to do is philanthropy. While she’s well on her to way that, we hope she gets there without losing herself first.

Robinsons Land ARTablado presents: Art Show Philippines’ ‘Limitless Expressions’ show,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/432164/robinsons-land-artablado-presents-art-show-philippines-limitless-expressions-show/,"12:07 PM November 08, 2022","Robinsons Land’s ARTablado initiative was birthed by the desire to empower Filipino artists of all levels and from all regions, and to connect them to a wider audience. The visions and voices of these artists from Mindoro, Antipolo, Batangas, Davao and other areas deserve the spotlight as much as those by artists from Manila and Cebu. Art, after all, is a democratic affair. An art group with the same vision as that of Robinsons Land ARTablado is Art Show Philippines (ASP), an artist-run community that aims to provide a global platform for Filipino artists. What began as an online gathering of artists during the pandemic has become a formidable multimedia organization of over 2,000 members from all over the archipelago with over 100 exhibits to its name. ASP has conducted fundraising exhibits for children with cancer and with special needs; art mentoring sessions for self-taught artists; art-material grants for artists in need; and mental health programs for creative people. The group also launched its Gallery Walk, marking the beginning of simultaneous virtual and physical art events for ASP. And on view until Nov. 15 is Art Show Philippines’ “Limitless Expressions” exhibit at Robinsons Land ARTablado in Level 3 of Robinsons Galleria, featuring over 70 artworks by 22 artists. The participating artists are: Anne Labesores, Aubrey Alminana, Bie Aya, Charlene Payawal, Cherry Agoyaoy, Dhennis Sigua, Frederick Epistola, Hannah Castalone, Irene Abalona, Jay Vincent Gatdula, Jaymee Liz, Joyce Palting, Mai Pimentel De Dios, MORI, Patrick Miranda, Peter Paul Cubar, Raneil Ibay, Raymart Mata, RH Baula, Sarah Manila, Tope Villaneuva, and Zol Domingo. “Limitless Expressions” is a feast of styles and palettes — with genres ranging from realism to impressionism, surrealism, fauvism and abstract expressionism. The people behind the canvases are interesting as well. Tope Villanueva is a Franciscan friar from Ozamis City who “evangelizes through art.” He travels to the country’s southern regions with his ukulele and paintbrush to conduct art therapy workshops for underprivileged Lumad, Muslim and Christian children. Mai Pimentel De Dios from Silang, Cavite started her full-time career as a visual artist after suffering the painful loss of her child. She is known for using recycled wood and limits her palette to just five colors. Annie Labesores is not just a contemporary visual artist but she is also an interior designer and an airline pilot. Irene Abalona is a quality control inspector at the Golden ABC company, but she is undaunted in her resolve to pursue painting. Zol Domingo is a nurse by profession and an artist at heart. Jaymee Liz believes that if our cultural heritage dies, so will our identity as Filipino. She produces art with striking and recognizable imagery — from images from FPJ movies and Starzan to portraits of Babalu and Elizabeth Ramsey. “Pop art is blatant, but meaningful.” For the artists of Art Show Philippines, “(In art,) every meaning is valid and every interpretation is authentic.” ARTablado, a portmanteau of “art” and “entablado” is Robinsons Land’s very own stage in showcasing Filipino ingenuity and creativity. This platform allows emerging artists to freely express themselves through art and paves the way to greater recognition of their talent and hard work. ADVT.    CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
"Aaron Carter, teen idol and brother of Nick Carter, dies at 34",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/432022/aaron-carter-teen-idol-and-brother-of-nick-carter-dies-at-34/,"01:03 PM November 06, 2022","Aaron Carter, the former teen idol, singer, and brother of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter, has passed away at the age of 34. In an exclusive obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department stated that a suspicious death took place at the address of Carter’s residence, but could not confirm the identity of the deceased. Carter was found lifeless in his bathtub. Rising to fame during the early 2000’s as with hit songs such as ‘I Want Candy’ and ‘Crush on You’, the singer releaseed his self-titled debut album in 1997 and performed as an opening act to his brother’s band The Backstreet Boys earlier that year. Carter was also known for his appearances in television, notably the hit Disney TV Show ‘Lizzie McGuire’, and ‘7th Heaven’ on The WB Television Network. He also appeared in his family’s reality show “House of Carters” on E! Entertainment Television.    A post shared by Hilary Duff (@hilaryduff)   Hilary Duff, whom Carter starred alongside in ‘Lizzie McGuire’, penned a touching message to the late singer after learning of his death. “For Aaron– I’m deeply sorry that life was so hard for you and that you had to struggle in-front of the whole world.

In 2017, he came out as bisexual which was received with an outpour of love from his fans. “There’s something I’d like to say that I feel is important for myself and my identity that has been weighing on my chest for nearly half of my life,” Carter wrote on Twitter. “This doesn’t bring me shame, just a weight and burden I have held onto for a long time that I would like lifted off me.” In 2019, the singer opened up on an episode of ‘The Doctors’ about his struggles with his mental health. It was revealed that he suffered from multiple personality disorder, schizophrenia, manic depression, and acute anxiety.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Wake-up call for employers: Reclaiming humanity in the workplace,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/431024/wake-up-call-for-employers-reclaiming-humanity-in-the-workplace/,"01:53 PM October 25, 2022","INQLusive HW 1920×1080 post. The pandemic has caused major shifts in the world beyond global physical health and safety, forcing employers and employees alike to reevaluate how we work and what we value as productive members of society. The third installment of the INQlusive webinar series “New World of Work” examines how the world has changed and still has to change in terms of work culture, leadership and the role of technology in our lives. The INQlusive webinar series is an advocacy campaign launched in 2020 by the Inquirer and Inquirer.net to discuss the impact of the health crisis on various societal issues. As we wade deeper into a more and more technologically advanced future, there is a realization that we need to resurface and reclaim our humanity in the workplace. While technology will never replace human work, it does have its place in improving processing and business operations in many industries, according to Stephen Thomas Misa, Amazon Web Services Philippines country head, president and chair. Channeling that advantage afforded by robots and artificial intelligence, people can take on and learn new skills that would differentiate them from those that can be relegated to machines, said Vanson So, Canva Philippines people lead. According to the webinar panelists, among the skills needed in the future are digitization, using body language and facial expressions in online settings, written communication, critical thinking, resilience, mental agility, ability to recognize feelings, coping with changes in positive ways and empathy. They agreed that there is a need to recognize that organizations are made up of human beings who have responsibilities and go through challenges in life, at work or at home, and therefore should be treated with compassion. With global phenomena like The Great Resignation and “quiet quitting” coming to the fore, employers must understand how to elevate employee experience, especially in work-from-home setups where the lines between work and life increasingly blur. “I want to call it The Great Realization,” said Vina Paglicawan, TaskUs director for wellness and resiliency in Asia, about the worldwide trend of employees leaving jobs they’re not happy in. “In the last two years, the COVID pandemic gave us an opportunity to reevaluate our lives. This is a great time for people to really realize what’s important for them.” Meanwhile, quiet quitting is about taking control, said Cat Triviño, cofounder and head of content of MindNation. Workers doing the bare minimum—the exact job required of them and nothing more—is an exercise in setting boundaries. “But at the end of the day, is it going to contribute to growth?” There should be openness between leaders and members, according to her. When employers are open about their own challenges, it inspires employees to be more open and more supportive as well. “Then we can create that healthy organization that not only gets the job done, but also thrives.” For Miguel Guina, Philippine Management Association of the Philippines academe industry committee chair, work and life cannot be separated. According to him, whatever happens to someone’s personal life seeps into their work life, which is where valuing humanity comes in—treating people as people. “Your employees are your brand. So we want to make sure that people really gain a sense of belongingness, inclusivity, empowerment, so that they really enjoy and thrive doing the best work of their lives,” said So. At the core of it all is trust, according to the panelists. So said that, especially in remote setups, there should be a shift in the way employees are treated. Employers should be able to trust their employees and instill in them a sense of accountability to achieve their goals without intervention from management. “You don’t bound people and put them in a box. You hire brilliant people and you let them be. Let them show you how to do the work. That’s how you not just elevate the employee experience, but you can also elevate the effectiveness of your organization,” So added. Ronaldo Turla, managing director at Talent Reach Consulting, emphasized the principle of giving people a chance—providing safety and support when employees make mistakes. The connection that it provides, he said, is priceless. “With regards to managing performance, nothing beats the consistency of communication from the managers,” he added. According to Misa, a recent survey named the Top 3 criteria highly sought after by employees as attractive salaries and benefits; flexible work environment; and a strong leadership. “Everything rises and falls on leadership,” he said, quoting bestselling author and leadership guru John C. Maxwell. “If we have more leaders leading with vulnerability, compassion, authenticity, I’d say we’d be in a far better place years from now,” Paglicawan said. Triviño said that something that often gets overlooked when discussing cultivating better leaders in the workplace is self-care for the leaders themselves. “You can’t fill from an empty cup.” Paglicawan added that stigma surrounding mental health is dangerous: “Stigma would stop someone from asking for help. Stigma would stop someone from extending help.” That’s why there is a need to talk more about not just mental health, not just mental illness, “because we may not be sick, but we’re probably not also well,” she added. Triviño asserted that one’s mental health is more than just one’s productivity, adding that some of the greatest outputs in prioritizing safety and well-being are beyond measurable. “Well-being is always a gatekeeper,” Guina said. “If you don’t have a mentally well employee, it’s hard to really have great-performing employee.” His message to employers: “’Esse quam videri’—to be rather than to seem. Do not just seem like valuing well-being, do and be a champion of well-being.” Turla said: “In the new world of work, we have the chance to create, recreate. For people to peak again, there has to be hope. Hope is something that everyone can have and that will propel us to better things to come.” INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
6th SEABCS: ‘Stories of Hope’ resound,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/429400/6th-seabcs-stories-of-hope-resound/,"05:41 PM October 03, 2022"," Stories of hope and courage resounded through the region at the closing ceremony of the 6th Southeast Asia Breast Cancer Symposium (SEABCS), held Sept. 23 to Sept. 25 in Taguig City and online. Hosted by Icanserve Foundation and Global Focus on Cancer and supported by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Union for International Cancer Control, SEABCS 2022 had close to 2,200 registrants from 24 countries, gathering doctors, caregivers, patient advocates and cancer survivors from Southeast Asia and beyond. Emceed by actress, writer and Icanserve spokesperson Bibeth Orteza, the last session featured five breast cancer survivors: journalist and mental health advocate Alya Honasan, triathlete Sheilla Gagui, patient advocate Marivic Bugasto, pediatrician Dr. Anna Lisa Ong-Lim and entrepreneur and Icanserve president Nikoy de Guzman.  The survivors recounted their experiences and shared how they were living with cancer. Honasan shared how experiencing clinical depression helped her focus on what she needed to do to beat breast cancer. She encouraged participants to look after their mental health and make use of counseling and other resources to resolve issues that stem from anxiety, fear and restlessness. Gagui, a mother of two, said her “world stopped” after hearing her diagnosis. She believed she was at her fittest, having done gymnastics and participated in triathlons, marathons, Ironman and Spartan races. She is most grateful for the full support of her husband, “who never missed a race or a chemo session with me.” She is now back in competitive races and advises fellow survivors to “never lose hope and faith, because that is all we have left.” Bugasto, a Stage 4 breast cancer survivor, narrated how she learned how to be a patient advocate from Icanserve when she attended the foundation’s very first Patient Power Summit, a training course for patient groups in the Philippines, in 2006. She shared her learnings with her support group, Minda’s Buddies and was then elected as its president. She is an award-winning civic leader in her home city of Baguio and continues to live in “love and service.”  Ong-Lim, a doctor and professor of pediatrics, recalled a series of “divine” appointments that somehow led to her early stage breast cancer diagnosis. As chief of the Infectious and Tropical Disease Division of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital, Ong-Lim was a leading public health expert during the COVID-19 pandemic, called upon to answer queries and educate Filipinos through media interviews and other fora. De Guzman, who twice battled breast cancer as she was diagnosed on each breast 12 years apart, plunged headlong into learning, getting certifications to teach Bikram Yoga, Yoga for Breast Cancer Survivors, Kids Yoga, Chair Yoga, Zumba Kids, Zumba Gold, Pound Pro (a cardio workout using drum sticks and Pilates-inspired movements), Generation Pound Pro (for kids), Nirvana Fitness Restorative Yoga and Make Up Artistry—all these while managing the family business. De Guzman has led Icanserve as president since 2018. Icanserve also launched a free online patient manual, “You Can Do This.” Edited by Honasan, it is meant to be a breast cancer patient’s companion throughout their journey. It also contains information for women who want to be vigilant about breast health, supporting Icanserve’s advocacy of early detection and timely and correct treatment. Download it for free from the Icanserve website (icanservefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ICS-Patients-Manual-FINAL.pdf). The next SEABCS will be held in Vietnam in 2023.

"Integrating the best walking strategies into your daily life – why, when, where, and how?",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/428097/integrating-the-best-walking-strategies-into-your-daily-life-why-when-where-and-how/,"12:43 PM September 19, 2022","Do not underestimate the power of walking. It should be a part of your lifestyle. WHY: Walking can help you achieve your weight loss, fitness, and health goals Walking can help improve your fitness level, sleep, moods, and mental health enabling you to perform well in your day-to-day activities (from workouts to household chores).  You can also avoid injuries because walking as an exercise can strengthen your core and walking muscles. You can also experience significant changes in your weight, body composition, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and blood sugar level -all important for your cardiovascular health.  Walking is one of the most effective exercises for weight management.  When you walk, you move your whole body so you can burn calories while maintaining the most important muscles used for walking (lower body, core, and upper body). It is very important for one’s metabolism.  Walk at least 30 minutes a day to burn sufficient calories, enough to create an energy deficit that results in weight loss. Combine walking with strength training and a healthy diet to achieve progress faster. Completing 10,000 steps a day can help you burn 250 to 500 calories, depending on your weight and walking intensity.  A 500-calorie daily burn can help you lose one pound of fat a week (1 pound = 3,500 calories).  However, as you continue to lose weight, you burn less calories by doing the same number of steps/day, so you will need to increase more steps so you can reach the same calorie burn goals. This is the reason why 10,000 steps are not enough for other people to lose weight, lighter people (below 150 pounds) might need to complete 15,000 or more steps to burn 500 calories. This is what I have observed with some of my clients who track their number of steps and calorie burn per day.  As you become consistent with walking, you can increase the intensity or you can also level advance to running and other workouts that can help you break the fitness and weight loss plateau.  You can improve your overall health (manage and prevent diseases) with walking, so there’s no reason to skip walking even for as little as 10 continuous minutes, three times a day (can be after meals).  WHEN: The best time to walk for weight and health management I mentioned in one of my articles that your exercise time should be compatible with your sleep, energy level, goals, and lifestyle. You should really find the best walking time during the day, so as you become consistent with the habit, you will notice your overall progress (physical, mental, and emotional), and experience the results (fat loss, better endurance, and improved health results) so you get motivated to sustain the walking lifestyle on a long-term basis.   WHERE: You can walk anywhere, NO EXCUSES Walking is the simplest and cheapest form of exercise that can be done anywhere. You don’t need to spend money to burn the same amount of calories as in 45-minute cardio workouts done in various boutique studios or health clubs. You just need to wear comfortable workout clothes and a pair of walking shoes and then you are ready to go!   HOW: The most effective walking techniques Leisure walking to complete your goal steps for the day is an amazing way to burn calories.  However, studies show that you need to maximize your workout by considering the quality of your walking so you can improve your cardiovascular fitness, regulate your blood sugar level  and effectively burn fat.

‘We are ready’: Ballet Philippines begins anew,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/412389/we-are-ready-ballet-philippines-begins-anew/,"05:30 PM August 15, 2022","Wiser, bolder, more adventurous” are Ballet Philippines’ (BP) key words for its coming 53rd season. Artistic director Mikhail “Misha” Martynyuk has amped up the dancers’ technique and conceptualized new works calculated to present BP in a rousing new light. Pivotal to his job is designing the repertoire. The gala “Dance Here and Now” on Sept. 17 kicks off the season at the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP). The program features “Paquita,” a classic about the romance between a French officer and an aristocrat who was raised as a gypsy. It climaxes with virtuosic variations in its lauded “Grand Pas Classique.” Rounding off Act One is the famed “Bolero,” set to French composer Maurice Ravel’s music. Completing the program is Martynyuk’s “Equus” (horse in Latin), a metaphor for the dancer’s workhorse ethic. Inspired by the pandemic lockdowns, it features dancers moving as though in a restricted space. Not wanting to reveal much detail, he simply said in an email, “You will see something unexpected, especially in the scenography.” The Christmas special features the dependable warhorse “The Nutcracker” on Dec. 17 to Dec. 18. Martynyuk’s take on this festive favorite is more character-driven, unlike others that focus on spectacle. The audience should discern the mise en scene (narrative and staging), he said. “All characters should come to life. My classic version is filled with different characters and magic that kids will enjoy.” For BP OnStream, Martynyuk choreographed a video, “Dance Through Time,” about the evolution of dance. It will be uploaded on the website (ballet.ph). The season-ended on Mar. 17 to Mar. 18, 2023, “Tatlong Pag-ibig ni Rizal,” presents the national hero’s life and loves, with choreography by American BP guest artist Joseph Phillips. Martynyuk has been building the dancers’ stamina and fine-tuning their movements, focusing on such details as the position of the hands, head and shoulders. “I pay more attention than usual to balance and pliés (knee bends that provide spring and balance) because they are the basic elements that we can control,” he said. And he’s been getting positive results, Martynyuk noted. “The dancers respond well to my corrections and pick up choreography very quickly. The dynamics of their movements have improved tremendously. I am impressed with each dancer’s hard work and progress. We are ready.” Martynyuk has witnessed BP’s undeterred evolution from the start of his term in April 2020. Due to global health restrictions, he had to teach remotely from Russia for two seasons. But since he and his family arrived back in the country early this year, he has kept his nose to the grindstone. At this writing, BP has 19 dancers, plus 11 guest artists from Philippine Ballet Theater and five from Ballet Manila. The bigger the group, he said, the better possibilities one sees as artistic director. “Each dancer is unique. You notice some for strong technique; others, for beautiful lines; still others, for charisma. They complement one another in shaping a strong and competitive company.” He is committed to the quest. For the ongoing Masterclass—BP’s free online classes given by international ballet stars and teachers—Martynyuk hopes to invite Ukranian danseur Vladimir Malakhov, one of the world’s greatest. Despite the language barrier between himself and the company, he has experienced the enduring benefits of communication. “My whole career with BP has been one big lesson. Working with famous Filipino artists, dancers, respected figures from the different arts, I have retained our conversations and their methods in my head. Now I get to use all of those.” Meanwhile, a Capricorn as head of an organization is a force to reckon with. BP president Kathleen Liechtenstein bolstered the company’s presence during the pandemic via its online platform, BP OnStream, on its website (ballet.ph). The virtual launch of BP’s 52nd season last year was attended by more than 100 media guests and supporters and generated some P2.35 million worth of public relations value. Eleven video productions carried a diverse range of themes—fashion, patriotism, domestic tourism, mental health, art and nature in collaboration with different organizations—and have been watched by a total of over 75,000 viewers at the latest count. A total of 1,783 registered for 57 master classes conducted by international guest artists. Two live roundtable discussions drew 50,000 viewers. BP launched its podcast on Spotify, “BP Barre Talks,” whose aim is to cultivate a new audience. Over 30,000 enthusiasts from 50 counties have visited ballet.ph to date. Renowned American guest choreographer John McFall conducted 38 online rehearsals for “Ancient World,” one of BP’s most widely viewed video performances on the website. Since its launch in 2020, BP OnStream has attracted 83,250 visitors as of June 30 this year. Since the dance companies are still financially impacted by the pandemic, BP recently launched the Guest Artist Program (GAP), which urges dancers from Philippine Ballet Theater and Ballet Manila to stay in top shape via a joint training. “This is not a coalition of companies to produce a concert,” Liechtenstein clarifies. “The program aims to financially sustain the dancers while helping them maintain high performance skills.” Those who pass the auditions attend BP classes and rehearsals and receive a salary grant from board chair Antonio Cojuangco and patroness Mercedes Zobel. The package also includes health insurance, dance shoes and costumes. Liechtenstein notes that the companies signed a memorandum of agreement so that the guest artists could still maintain employment in their respective groups. Addressing talk that the board has taken over the artistic director’s role of carving out the company’s identity, Liechtenstein explains: “As president, I don’t even know what Misha is up to until he tells me. He says, ‘This is what I want’—he is attuned to what’s happening in dance companies worldwide, post-COVID. ‘Bolder BP’ is all his. He will do it. I just ask, ‘What do you want from us? He gives us the costing, we approve, and perhaps see what can we do without.” She commends Martynyuk for being flexible with regards to working conditions, such as teaching and rehearsing at Studio One at the CCP Complex, an additional dance space to the CCP Rehearsal Hall. It has no air conditioning. In 2014, it was built out of four container vans donated by shipping heiress Doris Magsaysay-Ho. “Misha is very charismatic,” Liechtenstein notes. “Dancers just love him—adore him, even. The discipline that he instills has opened their minds to what is out there. So they are more confident and more motivated. And they are happier.” —CONTRIBUTED INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
The importance of positive self-talk,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/412051/the-importance-of-positive-self-talk/,"03:40 PM August 09, 2022"," Having been a “negatron” for the better part of my life, it’s an extra effort for me to look at the bright side of life. The bright side about being aware of this is I consciously become intentional about it, more so when I became a parent. I read somewhere about the power of the word “yet” being useful in coaching kids through challenges (okay, so it helps me, too). My 7-year-old was getting grumpy about her drawing not looking exactly like the Pokemon she was copying. “I suck at this! I can’t do it!” she whined. “Let me see … ” I appraised her work. “Hmm. You can’t do it yet,” I emphasized. “Try again later. Or tomorrow.” I could see that she appreciated how I took her pain seriously, and didn’t trivialize her opinion, or say, “No, it’s great!” as if affirmation would undo her honest critique. My daughter is improving, a smidgen at a time, and I praise her efforts and incremental progress. She has carried the same persistence over to polishing piano pieces on her own without me having to tell her to try again. She knows when she hasn’t quite got it yet, but she’s not hung up about it. My son is more easily frustrated with piano practice. There are days I see him light up when he unlocks a particularly challenging sequence, but many times, especially when he was younger, it was like pulling teeth. Now that he’s a tween, he’s discovering how to play the songs he likes, and he’s enjoying the process of figuring it out and searching for tutorials online. I remind him that he got to where he is now because of the many years of putting in the almost daily work. He still gets days where he gets mad and says, “I don’t want to do this anymore! I’m not going to be a piano player anyway! I’m going to be a pilot!” Then I ask: “What is the piano for?” He rolls his eyes and grumbles, “To make us persistent and disciplined.” I then try to correlate his struggle in pilot-speak, something about the piano being his flight simulator. Then maybe because he just really wants to get out of there or shut me up but somehow he overcomes his challenges and he saunters off proudly. I recuperated from an arm injury and so I was doing physical therapy at home. It wasn’t new to me as I’ve done therapy after every injury I’ve had since my 20s. The first time I had to do it back then, it truly sucked. But in hindsight, I’m glad to have gotten hurt early on because the experiences have taught me that if I keep slogging through the discomfort and boredom of therapy, I will eventually get better. I always have. But I had to put in the work to get there. My arm may be hurt temporarily, but my legs are still okay, so I jog. I do yoga twice a day. No major pretzel twisting, just 10-30 minutes in the morning and maybe a bit longer in the late afternoon, as I find it helps my nervous system and mental health aside from helping me gain better physical mobility. The kids see me doing this daily and I find that it helps bring the point of progress and improvement home when I verbalize what I’m doing and why. It normalizes positive self-talk and opens the door to more productive brainstorming. I bring it up when they encounter setbacks, whether it’s learning Math, playing badminton, or losing to Kuya in jiujitsu: “Okay, he’s got your arm. What else have you got?” Asking the right questions helps her realize what else is in her arsenal, that all is not lost, and that she doesn’t have to focus on getting her arm out by pulling and expending all her energy in the process. Shifting one’s concentration to what you do have is a big mind opener. My son has had his share of scrapes, stitches and physical therapy. Thankfully, all this hasn’t toned down his thirst for adventure. As nervous as it makes me, I know that pragmatically nurturing his fearless attitude is what’s best for him if he is to accomplish his dreams. I’ve had to unlearn confidence deflators like “Be careful!” and switch it up with things like, “I see you’re taking a risk there. What’s your plan?” These things don’t come naturally to me. I’ve had to actively seek out these techniques by reading many articles and listening to so many podcasts I no longer know who to allude them to. But if I am to upskill myself into better parenting shape (even if it is while cooking dinner because it’s all the time I have), then I do it. Progress over perfection. —CONTRIBUTED   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
WATCH: Rica Peralejo takes on jumping rope challenge to help spread awareness on suicide,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/411746/watch-rica-peralejo-takes-on-jumping-rope-challenge-to-help-spread-awareness-on-suicide/,"08:02 PM August 03, 2022","Actress and vlogger Rica Peralejo hopes she can be instrumental in helping curb suicide cases by taking the jumping rope challenge. Peralejo believes suicide is a mental health issue that needs to be addressed, as can be seen in her Instagram page yesterday, Aug. 2, where she shared a short video of her doing the challenge. “Our main objective is to spread the awareness on SUICIDE because it snatches one life every 40 seconds,” she said. “SUICIDE o ang pagpapakamatay ay sakit. Ito ay mas laganap kaysa inaakala mo. Marahil meron kang kaibigan or kamag-anak na nakakaisip nito. Hahayaan mo ba yun beshy?” (Suicide or taking one’s life is a disease. This is more prevalent than what you think. Maybe you have a friend or a relative who has considered this. Would you just let that happen, friend?) The rules of the challenge are simple: once you are nominated to do it, you can post your jump video the following day.   A post shared by Rica Peralejo-Bonifacio (@ricaperalejo)  “You record yourself doing 25 Double Under or Regular Bounce or South Paw Double under,” she explained. “Pwede rin (It can also be) South Paw single/regular bounce even if you trip to get 25. Pwede rin gawin (You can also do) both just don’t forget the fist bump at the end of the video.” While the routine can be challenging, Peralejo was able to do it. She also reminds everyone to nominate at least two persons after doing the challenge. “Let’s reach as many people as possible, [friends], let’s hope by doing this we can build awareness for anyone who is suffering from mental illness, you are not alone we are here for you,” she said as she tagged some friends. Peralejo added that having done the exercise, she sees how related it is to how jumping helped her overcome her passive suicidal thoughts.

How to improve your relationship with food,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/410678/how-to-improve-your-relationship-with-food/,"04:26 PM July 21, 2022","Content warning: This article contains details regarding eating disorders. Do you think a lot about food, your body, and your weight? Do you set a lot of extreme rules for yourself when it comes to meal timing and food choices? How many times have you followed and abandoned a popular diet? Studies have shown that the pandemic brought a significant rise in new cases (especially for adolescents) of eating disorders due to the accessibility of food during quarantine, social media, extreme stress, life transitions, exacerbated by social influence, environment, genes, past trauma, history of disordered eating behaviors and other mental issues. Disordered eating behaviors such as extreme dieting, following strict eating patterns, avoiding the most important nutrients or food groups and compulsive exercising can lead to diagnosed eating disorders such as anorexia (characterized by significantly low body weight due to intense food restriction), bulimia (characterized by a cycle of binge eating and purging or vomiting) and binge eating (characterized by frequently consuming a large amount of in a short amount of time). You might be manifesting some behaviors mentioned or even know some people who are dealing with this problem. Prevent the progression of this behavior before it develops into a serious illness by being more aware of your thoughts, emotions, and body through fixing your relationship with food while enjoying the process of lifestyle change to maximize your potential and live longer. Consult mental health professionals specializing in eating disorders if the warning signs are becoming more intense and harder to control. Hormonal imbalance Skipping meals and extreme food restrictions can greatly affect one’s hormones, causing irregular menstrual cycles, mood swings, infertility, and extreme stress. In addition, abnormal levels of hunger hormones (responsible for fullness and satiety and preventing overeating) such as ghrelin, leptin, and cholecystokinin as a result of disordered eating can disrupt the balance of the body, which becomes a major trigger in ‘binge’ episodes and feeling hungry all the time. Low energy Excessive dieting can affect your energy, productivity, and performance. Eating less than 1,000 calories a day (with or without exercise) won’t be effective in helping you achieve your most important tasks (work, connecting with people, gaining knowledge, accomplishing tasks at work and at home, and improving your health and lifestyle) for the whole day. Food and weight obsession Obsession about weight and food stems from habits like food restriction and regularly stepping on the scale. This can lead to diet-binge episodes, making you feel powerless when it comes to controlling eating. Low self-esteem Experiencing the repetitive process of the diet-binge cycle brought about by food deprivation is mentally and emotionally stressful. Also, believing that you lack control and willpower when it comes to eating and/or comparing yourself with others, how they look and what they eat in order to achieve their dream bodies, can negatively affect your emotions and how you perceive yourself (and your body).  Fad diets have implied the great need to follow eating rules, restrict certain food groups, and to avoid types of food to achieve weight loss. But people should be educated more about proper nourishment, how to make eating a more positive experience and how to be more aware of one’s body to achieve long-lasting results in terms of weight and health. Through the years, I’ve practiced and preached principles (not rules) and ways on how to make each and every eating experience positive, how to enjoy foods and how to honor the body by giving the proper nourishment it needs. Enjoy the overall process of eating Be mindful of your eating and recognize how your body responds to food Practice proven nutritional strategies that can break the cycle of overeating Appreciate how the food nourishes your body  Avoid dieting and be flexible with your eating  Some people delay their health and fitness goals because they might have the perception that extreme workouts and dieting are the only solutions to weight control.  But in fact, you can start getting results already by applying simple lifestyle change strategies. You don’t need to do fasting, perform high-intensity workouts right away and/or buy the most expensive healthy foods.  You can still continue your usual lifestyle like eating out and socializing because, in reality, you can’t remove these pleasurable activities from your life – you just need to apply small changes for now. You don’t need to exercise daily. Just move, walk, or dance and you will feel better and more alive. You can still go to fast food restaurants when needed, but choose healthier alternatives like grilled instead of deep-fried chicken (or remove the skin) and drink more water than sodas.

This artist takes you through her experience with bipolar disorder,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/410417/this-artist-takes-you-through-her-experience-with-bipolar-disorder/,"04:21 PM July 15, 2022","Jasper Castro attended a science high school but even back then, her big passion was art. “I was skipping most of my classes to paint back drafts and join writing and painting contests. Everyone was concerned about their grades while I was just sniffing paint outside the classroom. I think that’s when I really fell in love with art and knew the lengths I’d go for it,” she told Lifestyle. It was a passion that traced its roots to her childhood. “My mom put a crayon in my hand the moment my fingers learned to grasp anything. Since then, I would be constantly doodling—at church, at school—and it actually helped me focus better. I’ve always known art was my true love.” Castro loves art so much that she took a break from her public relations agency life to focus on it. The now freelance writer and media relations consultant said, “I have a million interests that all feed into my art: nature, music, movies, food, travel, religion, feminism, mental health, philosophy, cycling, animals and advanced formulas in Excel.” Mental health is the theme of her digital exhibition “The Artist is Alive,” which went online yesterday on theartistisalive.online. Curated by Raymond Tribdino, the exhibit invites anyone with internet access into an immersive ASMR art experience. Castro combines painting and poetry in the quest to take people through the ups and downs of living with bipolar disorder. Castro was diagnosed in her early 20s. “A series of heartbreaks led to yearslong clinical depression that stole years of my life. My doctor and I agreed that the blowup was a long time coming, as symptoms for the disorder had been present since I was a suicidal 4-year-old.” She believes her “consistent dedication to the arts” helped her through childhood and growing up, just like it helped her embrace herself after she emerged from her depression feeling like a different person. It is this series of artworks—the ones she painted as she learned to love herself again—that is featured in “The Artist is Alive.” “I drained all my resources for this and regret nothing and I loved every second of it. When I paint, it’s a religious experience. Overthinking is often a bad thing and leads most to spiral, but in art, it’s what fuels me. Only in art can I really embrace all of myself—walang sayang—nothing is wasted, and everything is celebrated, even an often troubling brain.” Castro said that people with bipolar disorder “are really just like everyone else,” adding, “there’s almost no point in generalizing because every case is a little different. But at the same time, we need the same things as someone neurotypical: love, acceptance, understanding—the whole shebang. So if people want to better treat or understand a loved one with bipolar disorder, go beyond research and just get to know them personally.” In “The Artist is Alive,” Castro gets personal—really personal. It should be experienced on a desktop or a larger screen and with a pair of headphones so the audience can view the paintings while listening to the artist’s spoken-word poetry. Castro hopes to “to connect and befriend the audience as she handholds them through the exhibit to listen to her deepest darkest secrets.” Castro said, “Everything is very intentional—both in my poetry and painting. Similar to Frida Kahlo, I draw a lot of self-portraits, use nature as metaphors, and use art to help me process my life, but also help me embrace all of my peculiarities.” She added, “As a writer though, I do take after nihilistic humor—my favorites are David Sedaris and Roald Dahl … Most of my writing is very heavy in tone and style.” Her message for other young artists? “It’s never too late unless you die, so don’t kill yourself. Don’t forget to enjoy yourself. Making art is a privilege.” Days before the exhibit opening, she said, “I’m feeling over-the-top hopeful. I hope it reaches its audience so they feel less lonely. But also, I hope this enables me to make more art. But I think these hopes are what’s making me so anxious that I haven’t been able to eat and sleep right these past few days. Also, I’m nervous because I’m sharing embarrassing secrets.” But being open is important to her. “I think what makes this project so important to me is that it makes a safe space for the audience. When you’re brave enough to show your vulnerability, others feel safe to also show their vulnerability. Honesty begets honesty. And honesty is key to mental health in my experience! It’s the only way you’re really able to fully process the breadth of life, when you’re able to be authentic. “This isn’t just for people with bipolar disorder, it’s really for everyone—the idea of honesty as a vaccine for cognitive dissonance. I hope my honesty sets a precedent.” She added, “I hope others find comfort in my art and it makes them glad to be alive. This whole collection is really an expression of my love.” Follow @perperesque, @jasperhannahart on Instagram; visit theartistisalive.online, open.spotify.com/show/6BHZEKZOtsMZ6VpVFuEXng.

Bianca Gonzalez on outdoor play: Not just for kids,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/409628/bianca-gonzalez-on-outdoor-play-not-just-for-kids/,"07:23 PM July 04, 2022","TV host Bianca Gonzalez believes that playing outdoors is so important for children. She also recently learned its many other benefits for adults. Gonzalez shared what she learned about the many good things related to playing outdoors and connecting with nature through her Instagram page today, July 4, where she showed a short video of herself and her children while playing. “Outdoor play is SO important. Pakiramdam ko nga hindi lang para sa mga bata (I feel that it is not only for children) but for us adults as well, lalo (especially) for our mental health,” she said. “I learned so much from our June #TalkED episode where we had Teacher Jackie Bugarin-Uy a certified Forest School Practitioner based in Finland, as our guest,” she added, referring to one of her vlog episodes with the Knowledge Channel. Gonzalez then shared about the Loose Parts Theory, explaining “that things we can move around and tinker with will develop the creativity and imagination of our kids much better than static materials or toys with a specific use.” “Try to think about when kids play with leaves, twigs, rocks, flowers. Like a toy car can pretty much only be a toy car, but materials they find in the outdoors can be anything they imagine it to be,” she said.   A post shared by Bianca Gonzalez Intal (@iamsuperbianca)  The Flow State is all about concentration, Gonzalez explained next. “Have you ever found your kids or yourself so zoned into something na kahit tinawag pangalan, hindi titingin (even when called, the child would not look)? When you are fully focused on what you are doing, not noticing distractions around and time seems to pass, that is actually a good thing because brain connections are being strengthened and kids are fully enjoying the process they are in,” she said. As for Biophilia, Gonzalez explained that it is “about the innate human instinct to connect with nature that has many benefits like reducing stress, improving cognitive function, enhancing mood and creativity.” Gonzales learned from teacher Jackie that even “a few minutes a day to walk outside and get some sun, or gather materials from the outside to do arts and crafts inside the house, taking care of a pet or plants, when done consistently, these all count as outdoor play and [are] crucial to kids’ development.” JB RELATED STORIES: Bianca Gonzalez speaks up on Toni-Bongbong interview Bianca Gonzalez urges public to fight disinformation  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Son directs Gary V in reimagined ‘Joseph the Dreamer’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/409748/son-directs-gary-v-in-reimagined-joseph-the-dreamer/,"05:31 PM July 04, 2022","More than 20 years ago, Gary Valenciano brought his well-known signature energy moves and charismatic stage presence to the titular biblical character in Trumpets’ recurring musical, “Joseph the Dreamer” (JTD). Now, in its most recent restaging, he plays the hero’s flawed father, Jacob, in a more sober approach that might contrast with the comic but lovable take of the late Freddie Santos who first essayed the role in the late 1980s. Valenciano maintains that he will play Jacob as “a real father who has 12 sons who are messed up. He tries to keep things together. To keep it light might not deliver the story. I’m trying to bring in the reality of today.” Helping him and alternate Audie Gemora to keep things grounded are the millennial sensitivities and sensibilities infused into Santos’ original script by directors Paolo Valenciano, his own son, and Nelsito Gomez. In this version of JTD, which was last performed in 2020 prior to the lockdowns, issues like mental health, the consequences of parenting and family dysfunction were not glossed over. The so-called good guys, not just the “villains,” also took accountability for their actions; for example, Jacob’s overt favoritism of Joseph over the rest of the brood ultimately drove them to sell him to slavery. Valenciano says that modern parents can sympathize, if not identify, with Jacob’s dilemma. He muses, “Jacob is in a place of regret, his sons are not doing well, his family is not where he wants it to be. Things were not falling into place … There is a moment of realization when Jacob realizes that he had been difficult on the other sons.” The one important lesson Valenciano himself realized as a parent while raising his now adult three children is that communication is a two-way street. It is something he brings to his performance. “If you want to sit down with your kids, no matter how difficult the situation, there must be communication, even if their voices rise above the usual decibel levels. That happens once in a while, in any family dynamic. But if you close your door, you stand the risk of your kids seeking counsel and comfort from other sources, like strangers online or going into substances.” Valenciano has extended his parenting advocacies into sessions with students in universities ranging from the exclusive to the public. Prior to COVID-19, he had visited about 45 schools, each with 150 participants, a number that allows him to “develop a relationship with them so I can go back to them” should they need to talk to him. Given the chance, what he would tell these kids’ parents is a process that he and his wife Angeli learned to practice on their own: “Listen to them. Maybe they need someone at the point of their need without telling them that they need to do certain things.” Valenciano the performer does listen to the musical’s directors, including his son. Although father and son have been working together in concerts for 10 years, pushing the older man into a more emotional country made this experience a bit different. Paolo describes the new offstage-to-onstage dynamic that went into play: “We’re trying to emulate stories and truths [about parent-child relationships] and see those moments between Jacob and the other sons. What we’re going for is something real. We want to resonate with families, not just fathers, but even with mothers. “As his son, I can tell when [the scene] is not real. But when it is, the reactions [of the stage sons around Jacob] are priceless. The audience will see another side of Gary Valenciano that no one has ever seen before.” —CONTRIBUTED INQ “Joseph the Dreamer” 2022 will run from July 15 to July 31 at Maybank Performing Arts Theater, Bonifacio Global City; Ticketworld, tel. 88919999; visit bit.ly/JTD2022  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
In-person classes: 6 ways to cope with anxiety,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/409259/in-person-classes-6-ways-to-cope-with-anxiety/,"07:21 PM June 27, 2022","After two years of online classes, in-person sessions in school may trigger the anxiety of students due to the continued pandemic, due to lost social skills, deteriorated social connections and fear for safety. This restlessness may cause concentration difficulties, intrusive thoughts and sleep problems. Symptoms may also manifest through muscle tension, frequent headaches, stomach aches, irritability and fatigue. Child and adolescent psychotherapist Katie Hurley on Psycom, a highly regarded mental health resource founded by psychiatrist and clinical psychopharmacologist Ivan K. Goldberg, has shared several coping strategies to combat this feeling. “It’s really important to remember that you endured a very difficult year that included a lot of uncertainty and near-constant change,” said Hurley, who authored “No More Mean Girls” and “The Happy Kid Handbook.” The Benilde Well-Being Center of the De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde understands that while campuses gradually open for limited in-person classes, the idea of reengaging in physical activities might take a toll on the mental health of learners. “If your anxiety is making it difficult to get to school or your symptoms are interfering with your ability to complete your schoolwork and do other favorite things, it’s time to see a licensed mental health professional,” Hurley advised.

How 3 PH public schools made the World’s Best School Prizes shortlists,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/409061/how-3-ph-public-schools-made-the-worlds-best-school-prizes-shortlists/,"02:21 PM June 25, 2022","Three Philippine schools made it to the Top 10 shortlists of the World’s Best School Prizes, launched this year by T4 Education (t4.education), together with Accenture, American Express, Yayasan Hasanah, Templeton World Charity Foundation and Lemann Foundation. Each winning school will be granted $50,000, to help sustain and improve their work and fortify their school and community. The schools will showcase their expertise at World Education Week, the biggest online school celebration hosted by T4 Education, in October. The prizes will be awarded to schools that have developed expertise and shown outstanding systems and practices that impact the lives of students and the community in five key areas: community collaboration, environmental action, innovation, overcoming adversity and supporting healthy lives. “With over 1.5 billion learners impacted by school and university closures, COVID has greatly exacerbated a global education crisis in which, even before the pandemic, the UN warned progress was already too slow to achieve universal quality education by 2030,” said Vikas Pota, founder of T4 Education and the World’s Best School Prizes. “We have launched the World’s Best School Prizes as a grassroots solution to help build the systemic change needed. By telling the stories of inspirational schools that are transforming the lives of their students and making a real difference in their communities, schools can share their best practices and have their voices heard at the top table to help transform education.” Bonuan Buquig National High School (BBNHS) in Dagupan City was shortlisted for Environmental Action. This prize recognizes the importance of youth, students and schools in climate action that engage with global warming solutions. Being only 1 meter above sea level, Dagupan is vulnerable to floods. In 2009, Typhoon “Pepeng” (international name: Pharma) left most of the city submerged. Fishponds, rice fields and other industries were destroyed. The city government dredged rivers to minimize flooding, but the mangroves died off, too—the rivers were exposed to the direct heat of the sun and killed off aquatic life crucial to the ecosystem. With their main food source gone, many students had to stop schooling to work to support their families. To help its students and save the local environment, BBNHS mobilizes over a hundred volunteers and plants thousands of mangrove propagules annually, building new homes for marine life. Today, the mangroves along the Longos riverbanks are almost restored and stable. In 2014, BBNHS also began an International Coastal Clean-up. Volunteers collected garbage along Bonuan Beach. Biodegradable and nonbiodegradable trash were segregated. Plastics were upcycled into plant pots and decor. The school planted trees to rehabilitate a local dump site, too. Should BBNHS win, they plan to use the prize money to build a nursery that could support about 50,000 mangrove seedlings yearly and fund research to improve their mangrove propagation and preservation. G.L. David Memorial Integrated School (GLDMIS) in Balanga City, Bataan, was shortlisted for Community Collaboration. This prize recognizes schools that have developed partnerships with their community to have an integrated approach in helping their students, striving for a whole-child approach based on equity and inclusivity. GLDMIS has special literacy and emotional development programs for its students, most of whom are impoverished and malnourished. The school recognized malnutrition as a barrier to education, so it brought its community together with its Kain Pa project. Kain Pa consolidated parents, community members, local government and business establishments to give free meals to its students daily. The initiative secures vegetables, fruits and other goods from government officials, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and parents who buy ingredients from the market and sometimes help cook the meals themselves. With this initiative, the school was able to lower its students’ malnutrition rate from 12.11 percent in 2019 to 2.13 percent in 2020. Moreover, the school gets free eye screening through Essilor, which also donates glasses to pupils and teachers. If GLDMIS were to win, they would use the funds to improve the school’s library and laboratory, and continue to support its Kain Pa project and their other well-being programs. Malitbog National High School (MNHS) in Calinog, Iloilo, was shortlisted for Supporting Healthy Lives. This prize recognizes schools that provide access, relevance and opportunities for students, staff and the community to develop healthy habits, behaviors, knowledge and skills. With the pandemic, the homes of their 1,000 students have become classrooms. When classes began, 90 percent of their students were in poverty, with 60 percent malnourished. MNHS started its Happy and Healthy School Program to promote physical, mental and social health among its students. The program’s activities included home gardening, home-based wellness and advocacies for healthy eating, clean water, sanitation and mental health. The school also addressed the complications of home learning. When 80 percent of the parents communicated their inadequacy in helping their children with their studies, the school provided them with intensive detailed guidance. This led to more than 85 percent of parents feeling comfortable being their children’s learning coaches. MNHS also managed to solicit P2 million for disinfectants, printers and paper for home learning. And, the school increased its staff vaccination rate from below 1 percent due to initial vaccine hesitancy, to 100 percent as a result of its community-focused campaign. Should they be awarded the prize, MNHS would use the money to share its expertise with other secondary schools in the region, and create a Happy and Healthy Park as a venue for everyone to discuss issues impacting the local community. “I want to congratulate Bonuan Buquig National High School, G.L. David Memorial Integrated School and Malitbog National High School for making the Top 10 shortlists for the inaugural World’s Best School Prizes. Educators all over the world will now be able to learn from the examples of these outstanding Philippine schools,” said Pota. The Top 3 finalists for each of the five World’s Best School Prizes will be declared later this year.

‘We can achieve things when we trust our capacity to deliver’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/409015/we-can-achieve-things-when-we-trust-our-capacity-to-deliver/,"02:23 PM June 24, 2022","Young people who call out injustices or are vocal on social issues are often told that they’re too young to concern themselves with such matters. Oftentimes, they are met with online comments like, “Anong ambag mo? (What’s your contribution?)” But if there’s one thing that the youth representation in Congress has shown, it’s that young people have made more than their fair share of contributions. A quick search of Kabataan party list can show receipts of what the youth are capable of. In the six years that Kabataan party list Rep. Sarah Elago stood as the voice of the youth in Congress, she counted 21 principally authored laws that will leave an impact in the country. The landmark Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education, which institutionalized free tuition and other school fees in state universities; the Bawal Bastos law and the National Mental Health Policy are just some of them. “It’s important to flex these because we want to show that the youth give all that they can to push for measures … that have the interest of the people,” Elago said. To say that Elago and Kabataan party list have been productive is a gross understatement. There are more bills and measures that the youth representation has authored—457 bills in the 17th Congress and a whopping 726 the following term. This, despite the blatant attacks and Red-tagging against the group. Still, Elago has been consistent in reiterating that the credit is not theirs alone. “What makes us legitimate and our work more meaningful is we’re based on the membership, leadership, solidarity, principled unity of young people. If that’s the basis of your representation, I think there is nothing you cannot do. You can really make a great deal of difference,” Elago said during an online interview with To be You a few weeks before she steps down from office to give way to the new party list representative, Raoul Manuel. At 32, Elago has reached the age limit of youth representatives in Congress. But the energy, drive and stubborn optimism that’s often characteristic of youth is still evident in the lawmaker. Now that the 18th Congress has adjourned, Elago is occupied with writing letters of gratitude to their supporters. Kabataan party list is also busy refiling and updating their priority legislative measures. “Even though the session has ended, it does not mean that work has ended, too,” she said. Her writing days are not over yet, either. She plans to write about her experiences in Congress. Where she will publish it, in a book or a blog, has yet to be decided. “[The experience] is truly one of a kind. I need this reflection and writing time to digest everything I learned. I hope my story can inspire more young people to become a genuine youth representative in public service,” she said. Here’s an excerpt of To be You’s interview with Elago: There have been intensified attacks against the democratic rights and fundamental freedoms of the Filipino youth. This youth representation, for one, was frequently targeted and singled out by a systematic disinformation and malinformation campaign not only to undermine our youth representation but discredit the work we do and why we do it. There are trumped-up charges against representation, vocal youth dissenters, ordinary students. Young people who post on social media were even invited by authorities. We shouldn’t let that kind of environment persist because it affects the youth. These attacks sow fear, sow division. But young people have overcome it, they try to barrel through, power through all these attacks by focusing on campaigns, their aspirations and lending their voices. Historically speaking, it’s really the young people working with and alongside various sectors still experiencing multiple forms of abuse and discrimination. They have all been at the forefront of the struggle, the fight against abuse of power, corruption. This is why all those authorities who have records of abuses and violation of human rights are being threatened by the unity, solidarity and collective efforts of the people at large, all those standing up, working toward upholding democracy in our country. I think the focus on the urgency and necessity of having a genuine youth voice in Congress is what inspires us to continue showing up, do what we have to do and perform our noble cause in ensuring that our party list representation truly raises and adds to the voice of our constituents. By that I mean not just us who are in Congress, but we also voice out the concerns of the many students, young people who are in the labor sector, farmers, women, indigenous peoples. Why shouldn’t we speak up when we were entrusted by our constituents to speak on their behalf? A lot. Especially in the education sector. We have yet to fully reopen our schools safely so we need to push for funding to ensure the safe return of students and stakeholders. Number one, it’s really important to focus on the youth and people’s agenda. Each year we update the state of the youth address to make sure that our priorities are laid out and that they are based on the needs of our constituents. Second is to have faith in our youth representation, in the collective capacity of the national sectoral party and all our network and supporters, volunteers. We can achieve things when we trust our capacity to deliver. Third, it’s not enough that it’s just the youth. We need to talk and work with more sectors—especially the youth in the labor sector, farmers, women, indigenous peoples and LGBTQIA+. It is in this principled unity and solidarity where the strength of our youth representation lies.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022

Fullido feels that Philippine Independence Day should not only be a once-a-year celebration but an everyday one, as can be seen in her Instagram post yesterday, June 13. She shared a photo of herself, where she is wearing a Filipiniana gown. “More than remembering our hard-earned freedom, may this day be an opportunity to appreciate Filipino heritage, culture and tradition,” she said. For Fullido, every Filipino should appreciate the big and small efforts that our countrymen do to make the nation a better place. “We may have different ways of showing our love for the Philippines but let us appreciate even the little things that we do to express how much we love our country,” she said.   A post shared by Gretchen Fullido (@gretsfullido)  “Be proud of every inch of you as a Filipino, celebrate Independence Day not just today but everyday,” she stressed. To better drive home her idea, Fullido also shared a message from Carlos P. Romulo, the famous Filipino diplomat: “Let us teach our people again to be proud that they are Filipinos.

Miss World PH Tracy Maureen Perez looks back on her truncated reign,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/404869/miss-world-ph-tracy-maureen-perez-looks-back-on-her-truncated-reign/,"11:54 PM June 04, 2022","MANILA, Philippines — Tracy Maureen Perez is already set to relinquish her Miss World Philippines title just eight months after bagging her crown in October last year. But despite having a truncated reign, the beauty queen said she feels happy with what she was able to accomplish in such short a stint as a titleholder. “I’m happy for my successor, but I’m honestly a bit sad that it’s about to end. I had such an amazing journey both in the Miss World Philippines competition and in the Miss World itself,” Perez told the Inquirer on the sidelines of the press launch of the Miss World Philippines pageant’s partnership with Doill Technologies Inc. held at Kingsford Hotel in Parañaque City on May 25. The national pageant organization is releasing NFTs (non-fungible tokens) to raise funds for its advocacy projects on education and mental health. And Doill Technologies is helping merge blockchain technology with real-world engagements through the beauty contest by providing the platform for pageant followers and supporters to proactively take part in the Miss World Philippines’ thrust in making lives better for Filipinos. “We are filled with so many activities now, and I make sure I’m hands-on in the activities this year, So overall, I’m happy for the turnout,” Perez continued. The Cebuana lass, who finished in the Top 10 of the 70th Miss World pageant in Puerto Rico, said she believes she was able to fulfill much of what she set out to accomplish as a national titleholder with her participation in the global tilt. Perez made sure to showcase the best of the Philippines and highlight the Filipino talent in the international arena. “I was also able to shed light on the struggles of the single mothers all over the Philippines and especially in my community. So that alone, even if it’s just a small act of win for me, that I was able to bring that up on the international stage, I think that alone is enough for me to say that I was able to do my part as your Miss Philippines,” Perez shared. The outgoing queen said she would love to crown a successor who, like her, loves her parents. “It’s very, very important that you give them all the credit, and that you stay grounded,” she said. The next queen, Perez added, should “know that being a Miss Philippines is not a normal job, it takes so much responsibility, who does know in her heart that it’s gonna be hard to be the next Miss Philippines, but disregards all of those difficulties and still chooses to carry our country with so much pride.” After relinquishing her title, Perez would love to resume practicing industrial engineering but said she is not closing her doors on a possible entry into the entertainment industry. “But most of alI, I really want to continue my advocacy project for the single mothers. I also wanna take part in education and peace talks, and mental health awareness, of course,” she continued. Perez also said she would love to be invited to schools to share her personal experiences with the students, and also listen to the children’s stories and help uplift their situation. Perez will relinquish her Miss World Philippines crown at the coronation night which will be staged at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay City on June 5. Thirty-six ladies are vying for her crown, as well as four other titles—Miss Supranational Philippines, Miss Eco Philippines, Reina Hispanoamericana Filipinas, and Miss Eco Teen Philippines. Perez’s pageant sister Kathleen Paton brought home the Philippines’ second Miss Eco International crown from Egypt, while her teenage counterpart Tatyana Austria finished second in the Miss Eco Teen International pageant. Dindi Pajares was in the Top 12 of the Miss Supranational pageant in Poland, while Emmanuelle Vera finished fourth in the Reina Hispanoamericana contest in Bolivia. Michelle Arceo represented the Philippines in the inaugural edition of the Miss Environment International pageant in India where she was proclaimed Miss Ecosystem, or first runner-up. The Miss World Philippines pageant is reportedly not sending another delegate to the said global tilt, as well as in the Miss Multinational pageant whose last contest was staged in 2019. Shaila Rebortera was set to compete in the 2022 edition, while her predecessor Isabella de Leon finished her reign without seeing action abroad. Another “stay-at-home” queen was 2021 Miss Philippines Tourism Trisha Martinez, who was supposed to compete in an international pageant that did not take place as scheduled. The Philippines is trying to secure its second Miss World victory, nine years after Megan Young became the first Filipino woman to bring home the “blue crown” from the London-based pageant.

Torn apart by politics: Do you unfriend family?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/403614/torn-apart-by-politics-do-you-unfriend-family-approved/,"03:32 PM May 21, 2022","U nity was the chosen battlecry of presidential frontrunner Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. in the recent elections. His appeal was fervently echoed by his supporters online when Marcos was criticized for his skipping debates and dodging the media, among other things. The recent elections were more divisive than the last, with many supporters of Marcos and Vice President Leni Robredo, the runner-up, exchanging aggressive comments online and passive aggressive comments off the web. Many families were even divided, as evidenced by a popular placard which has become a fixture in Robredo’s rallies: “Anak ng BBM Supporter for Leni.” In fact, even after the polls were closed and initial results showed Marcos leading the count, there was an unfriending spree among people on opposing sides. With the polarizing results caused by the election, will the vaunted call for unity ever become reality for family members and friends who find themselves with different political leanings? Lawyer Jeffrey George Udarbe said he could not simply turn a blind eye on the picks of some of his family members in the recent polls. “When information is right at your fingertips and you choose to ignore facts based on a personal grudge, you get what you deserve. Your choice reflects your personality, and personality is not something you usually overlook in a person,” he said. The recent elections were not just about preference in the ballots, but it also represented the values of voters, according to licensed psychologist AJ Sunglao. The mental health advocate said that with the recent results, there are values that are being challenged, especially with martial law and our history.The challenge is reconciling these values that negate each other, said Sunglao. To address this divide, Sunglao said that there should be acknowledgment, not just of the beliefs, but of where those beliefs are rooted. Throughout the election season, Udarbe and younger members of his household debunked the false narratives that his relatives believed in. Confrontations were inevitable, he said, especially when conversations led to politics.The results of the unofficial count even escalated the emotions in Udarbe’s household.“While most of us were disappointed with the results, a few family members started to rub salt on our wound, gloat about their ‘victory,’ and started badmouthing our preferred candidate,” he said. Udarbe is not the only one who experienced this. Many more grieved and shed tears, and, for some reason, some people found great pleasure in seeing their grief. Tatiana (not her real name) received unsolicited advice from her grandmother after the elections. Her grandmother said she should have voted for Marcos, the leading candidate, instead. She was also told not to join Robredo’s thanksgiving rally, and just go home after class.“I’m really sad that my grandma is believing lies she read on the internet, and I’m really uncomfortable with their views of the elections,” the college senior said. Tatiana said that she did not engage in political conversations with her family to avoid conflict. “I’ve been called mayabang for taking a stand in what I believe is right. But there were no confrontations. We avoided the topic altogether. When they made misinformed statements, I didn’t have the courage to correct them out of fear of the consequences. I might be called disrespectful or ungrateful,” she said. Psychologist Shiela Manjares said that politics and religion are not easy discussions for families because these are very personal topics rooted in one’s beliefs.“Perspectives in politics, like the recent elections, came from each of our own beliefs, so we tend to be passionate. So sometimes, we tend to be stubborn in asserting what we believe in,” she said. It’s even trickier here in the country, where families are tight, and the elders, who are authority figures, insist on their beliefs. But as the college professor said, the younger generation’s picks were backed by their research, whereas their elders tended to rely on their personal experiences. Like what Sunglao said, Manjares said that there must be a conversation to understand and acknowledge each other’s reasons. It’s also an important first step to “recognize your emotions, ask yourself why you’re feeling this way. You’re feeling these things because you invested your time, your energy, your beliefs in something that you believed that the country needed,” said Manjares. Manjares also offered advice in dealing with people who relish the defeat of another candidate: social media detox.It’s also important to take a break from social media (that means no doom scrolling) to avoid triggers and to think clearly. It’s hard to cut people out of our lives, but there’s the option to unfollow or unfriend on social media. In gatherings, it’s best to be civil, and if you want to explain your feelings, choose the person who will likely understand or empathize with you. But unfriending and unfollowing is also a balancing act, according to Sunglao, as tuning out people with opposing beliefs may create an echo chamber. “Sometimes you don’t want to cut people off because you lose the chance of changing their minds . . . so it depends on the kind of relationship you want.” Sunglao added that for voters whose candidates won, it’s important to be respectful of the feelings of other voters, given that emotions were high during the polls. “Don’t gloat. Don’t ask people to move on. Let them feel their emotions. If you really care about them, be there for them as they go through their process,” he said. “To say that one must move on is being dismissive. It’s like saying whatever you feel just goes away because it’s over,” Sunglao said, noting that there were instances that this happened. He explained that the recent elections were emotionally packed, given the investment of energy, time and hopes that were poured into it by many people.“Regardless of who won, the supporters must be able to feel these things . . . We don’t get to decide how other people feel,” he said. For those who encounter people gloating, especially in their homes, it’s best not to engage. “We have to choose what kind of battle we want. Kung mang-aasar, ‘wag patulan because they take pleasure in winning. Instead, limit your social media activity and look for avenues where you can channel your passion, take control and help others, as well.”  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022

"Survey reveals delayed diagnosis, heavy disease burden among Filipinos with axial spondyloarthritis",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/402801/survey-reveals-delayed-diagnosis-heavy-disease-burden-among-filipinos-with-axial-spondyloarthritis/,"12:26 PM May 10, 2022","On average, Filipinos with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) are diagnosed 5.8 years after developing the disease. axSpA has a significant functional, psychosocial and economic impact on patients, highlighting the heavy disease burden of axSpA. These are among the key findings of the Philippine Map of Axial Spondyloarthritis (PMAS), an online survey conducted by the Philippine Rheumatology Association (PRA) and patient advocacy group Axial Spondyloarthritis Association of the Philippines (ASAPh). PMAS is the first comprehensive survey describing the demographic, disease characteristics, and patterns of disease, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with axSpA in the Philippines. A total of 128 Filipinos living with axSpA participated in the survey from July to October 2021, with the preliminary survey report completed in March 2022.1 AxSpA is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints that connect the spine to the pelvis.2 Symptoms typically manifest as chronic inflammatory back pain, stiffness and fatigue of the pelvis and lower back – although all regions of the body can be affected. AxSpA occurs in approximately 1% of the general population and can affect both men and women, with patients typically being in their twenties when they first develop symptoms.3 Most of the survey respondents were from the National Capital Region (42.2%) and nearby regions (45.4%). Respondents’ age ranged between 18 and 77 years, with an average of 39 years. Majority were male (76.6%) and over half were married (54.7%). Almost half (44.3%) were overweight or obese. Hypertension (35.6%), uveitis or eye inflammation (33.6%), and high cholesterol (28.2%) were the most frequently reported comorbidities. Delayed diagnosis Majority (75.8%) were diagnosed by rheumatologists; the rest by orthopedic specialists. Before being diagnosed, most respondents had multiple consultations with a rheumatologist (44.5%), an orthopedic specialist (43.8%), or a general practitioner (27.3%). Delay in axSpA “Although this still needs validation, a possible explanation for the longer diagnostic delay in women is the misconception that axSpA is a male-specific disease. For women, more common medical conditions are considered before a diagnosis of axSpA is made,” said Dr. Bernadette Heizel M. Reyes, Professor, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital Only 1 of 5 respondents (19.5%) had a diagnostic delay greater than 10 years, while 34.4% had a diagnostic delay of less than 2 years. Diagnostic delay was shorter in respondents who developed axSpA symptoms more recently; 73.4% were diagnosed between 2011 and 2021. “The shorter diagnostic delay observed in the PMAS study reflects the improved awareness and access to see a rheumatologist. However, we can still do better by educating and collaborating with primary care physicians and specialists to further shorten the time to diagnosis. In addition, the PMAS study can enhance the patient-physician relationship. Since axSpA is a multidimensional condition, the rheumatologist has the opportunity to discuss important concerns of a patient that are often not addressed on a clinic visit,” said PRA President Dr. Juan Javier Lichauco. Heavy disease burden Many respondents had active disease, spinal stiffness, and inflammation in the lumbar and cervical spine and hips. Three in four (75%) complain of moderate to severe stiffness in the lumbar spine. Many reported having difficulty doing routine daily tasks and requiring assistance; physical activity, use of public transportation, and tying shoe laces were the most commonly affected daily activities. A significant proportion of respondents reported issues related to mental health that affected their productivity. These include sleep problems (28%), anxiety (25.9%) and depression (25%). In addition, the survey results showed a correlation between mental health and disease activity. Respondents also reported that axSpA had a negative impact on their family relationships and social life. “We hope that the preliminary survey results can help healthcare professionals, policymakers, and pharmaceutical companies better understand the impact of axSpA from the patients’ perspective, and help improve the quality of care, access to treatment, and health outcomes of patients with axSpA,” said ASAPh President Engr. Clark Ferrer. “The Department of Health lauds the Axial Spondyloarthritis Association of the Philippines and Philippine Rheumatology Association for conducting the Philippine Map of Axial Spondyloarthritis. This groundbreaking and patient-focused survey is in line with the DOH agenda to improve health literacy, quality of care, and appreciation for primary care in the country,” said Dr. Beverly Ho, Concurrent Director IV of the DOH Health Promotion Bureauand Disease Prevention and Control Bureau. “Congratulations to PRA and ASAPh for completing this important survey and shedding more light on a disease that still remains not well understood around the world. Together with our partners, we want to raise the voice of Filipino patients living with axSpA, help prevent diagnostic delays, and hasten axSpA diagnosis for better treatment outcomes,” said Mr. Jugo Tsumura, Country President & Managing Director, Novartis Healthcare Philippines, Inc. “Novartis is working with our partners to help address diagnostic delays and shorten the patient journey by adopting a multidisciplinary approach to patient care, and providing patients with inflammatory back pain with tools and health information through the Clarrio app,” said Ms. Christine Fajardo, Patient Engagement Head, Novartis Healthcare Philippines, Inc.

Unfriended? How to destress after the elections,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/402794/unfriended-how-to-destress-after-the-elections/,"07:36 PM May 09, 2022","It’s the day after the elections. Historically, this is the election people will long remember, wherein the emotional intensity was at its highest—with feathers getting ruffled, relationships being strained, strange alliances being formed, and social media mired in an uncontrollable frenzy. In short, the national psyche has been upset. It will take time for the frayed nerves to be healed. There’s no instant soothing balm. But this campaign- and election-related problems are just as real as any established psychological disorder. It’s so real that mental health experts have given it a name—pre- and postelection stress disorder or PESD. In a 2020 report by the American Psychological Association (APA), majority of Americans were said to be highly stressed by the heated political climate, and close to 50 percent of those surveyed reported being sidetracked in their work because of their preoccupation with the political campaign. Although we’re not aware of any similar study done here, we believe Filipinos were very much in the same situation here with the just-concluded elections. The PESD could perhaps be more pronounced here. For some, the PESD could be severe enough to land one in a hospital. We had one patient who had a hypertensive emergency with the blood pressure shooting up to 220/100 mmHg, with signs of an evolving stroke. This was after he had an argument with a family member on their preferred candidates. PESD may well be an additional factor why cardiovascular problems are spiking in the last year or so. We attributed it to COVID-19, and possibly partly due to vaccination; but there’s a high probability that PESD may be a significant factor. Anxiety caused by the uncertainty of the outcome can really upset our nerves. Some medical experts compared it to the anxiety of waiting for the results of a biopsy of the tumor removed from one’s body. Is it cancerous or not? One has sleepless nights, worried to death of what the results may show. With the majority’s default setting of exaggerating one’s fears, then one can just imagine the havoc this wreaks on one’s emotion and psychological state. The same thing is true with PESD. Many have preestablished ideas about what would happen if one’s candidate does not win, and another candidate assumes the position. It may have some bases, but for the majority, it’s mainly a perception problem. However, the negative thoughts of what may happen have crystallized in one’s mind, and it’s as good as real. The impact on one’s emotional and physical health is also real, and could be disabling if not properly controlled. As we keep saying in this column, it’s not the stressor or cause of stress that determines how it would affect the person, but the manner by which the person reacts to the stressor. You may have PESD if you have any or several of the following signs and symptoms: stiff muscles, especially in the neck area and shoulders; headaches; sleep problems; frequently upset stomach; feeling of nausea and vomiting; anxiety and being worrisome; being upset over small matters; depression, withdrawal and social isolation; preoccupation with social media; emotional outbursts; and reduced productivity at work. If you have PESD, here are some ways you could help manage your PESD: 1. Emotional acceptance. Needless to say, recognizing and accepting that one has been emotionally bothered and affected by the concluded campaign and elections is an important precursor to healing. One then details in one’s mind how one has been affected—in terms of physical and emotional health, relationships, work productivity, finances, etc. Whatever emotions one feels—angry, disheartened, disgusted, hopeless, depressed—and other signs and symptoms as enumerated above, one should accept and realize that these may be appropriate but exaggerated reactions to the stressor. One must also accept the outcome of the elections, unless there was really a breach of its integrity—in which case, one should also accept that one may not be in a position to pursue the remedy of the breach actively. After one has accepted everything, one would be in a better position to think more constructively about what one is in a position to do. An emotionally bothered mind will never be able to think in an organized and constructive manner. One should make an inventory of solvable problems, and “beyond-oneself” problems, wherein one should have the humility and serenity to accept the situation. 2. Release all your PESD-related signs and symptoms. We should learn to let go, and stop ourselves from clinging to these PESD-related disorders, as if there’s nothing we could do about it. One should assume a relaxed position, either lying down or comfortably seated, with no external disturbances. Turn off your cell phones for 10 to 15 minutes. Meditation and visualization are important in this process. One should start it with several deep breaths until one feels more relaxed, visualizing relaxation of all muscles from head to toe. One then visualizes each PESD sign or symptom one has as one releases it to God, the source of all our healing, and the only one who could relieve us of all our burdens. One then visualizes oneself in a relaxed, happy and emotionally balanced state—distinguishing the difference between when one is tense and when one is relaxed. One may help this visualization by clenching one’s fists and tensing the arm muscles as a representation of tension, and relaxing the muscles when one is relaxed. One may feel silly or awkward at the start, but with repeated exercises, several times a day (preferably upon waking up and just before bedtime), this can help some without going for professional psychotherapy. 3. Reestablish your normal routine and a healthy lifestyle. If you’ve been staying up late, monitoring social media, actively reacting in your various Viber group chats, one should limit these activities and maintain a good sleeping schedule. Sleep hygiene is important in all stress-related disorders. Timing of sleep is also important. For us, 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. is the premium time for high-quality sleep. If we could just have a five-hour sleep within this time frame, then that’s just as good as sleeping eight to nine hours during daytime. Exercising most days of the week—at least four times a week—eating more fruits and vegetables with lots of antioxidants, and other practices that promote a healthy lifestyle can go a long way in bidding goodbye to PESD. 4. Reconnect also with family and friends. During the campaign period, many of us had strained relationships with close friends, including family members. There will not be any permanent healing unless we make a sincere effort to reestablish the broken ties. We may have unfriended some of our Facebook friends, and have also been unfriended by others. It’s time to reach out and reconnect with them. A long-standing study at Harvard has shown that of all factors that contribute to one’s happiness and longevity, robust and healthy relationships are the most significant contributing factor. 5. Identify the “stressor situations” and avoid them. One must be able to identify the habits, activities and other factors, including persons, that contribute to one’s PESD. This may be engaging in long hours on social media, watching the news, talking to some persons. One must moderate one’s use of social media. One may also just opt to read the newspapers rather than watch the news on TV, which may stir more emotions. One also can set boundaries in conversations, such as Viber group chats, to prevent escalation to emotionally tense situations. May our nation start the healing process.

Maxene Magalona shares how she deals with negative energy,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/402328/maxene-magalona-shares-how-she-deals-with-negative-energy/,"06:24 PM May 03, 2022","In observance of mental health awareness this month, actress and yoga instructor Maxene Magalona has shared her ways of dealing with negative energy. On her Instagram page today, May 3, Magalona recounted her struggles with mental health issues as she posted a recent photo of hers. “My higher self looking at me and secretly judging my bad decisions,” she said of her photo. “Visualize your highest self and start showing up as her,” she added, quoting jewelry designer Anita Quansah. Magalona admitted that she recently “made some poor choices” that had her “swimming in a pool of shame and guilt for a couple of days now.” “It’s not the easiest feeling, to be honest, as there are moments when I would just like the earth to swallow me up,” she noted. “Now that it’s #MentalHealthAwareness month, I just want to share how I’ve been dealing with negative energy such as feelings of shame, guilt, anxiety and fear, to name a few,” she said. She described humans as “very complex beings with so many different layers that transcend the physical.” “We are energetic beings who need to learn how to work with our emotions as these are actually our superpowers. The reason why we suffer and experience mental health issues is because we overthink and stay stuck in our analytical minds while cutting ourselves completely from our emotions,” she said. What needs to be done, Magalona said, is to “learn how to detach from our external material reality and connect to our inner world by sitting with ourselves and just being with whatever is happening underneath the surface.” This can be achieved “through yoga and meditation, we can gently hold space for ourselves as we process our emotions—both the good and the bad.” “We cannot just keep clinging on to what feels good for us. We need to process our pain as well. We need to feel in order to heal,” she said.   A post shared by Maxene Magalona (@maxenemagalona)  Magalona has lately been into meditation about her  thoughts and actions, keenly observing how  she has been handling herself, “crying, sitting and breathing through the discomfort.” “This may be a difficult and painful process but I choose to go through it because if I don’t, these negative energies will stay stuck and stagnant in my system and there’s just no way I’m going to allow them to poison my soul,” she said. Believing that her life is a “collection of all my choices,” she feels that “I am 100% responsible for my current life situation.” “I may have tripped and made a mistake, but I choose to learn from it instead of run away from it. I choose to feel my pain instead of denying and sweeping it under the rug. Pain is potential power and I choose to use it as fuel for my evolutionary development,” she said.  /ra RELATED STORIES: Maxene Magalona’s Earth Day appeal: ‘May we all be more mindful’ LOOK: Maxene Magalona dines with Rob Mananquil’s parents amid breakup speculations  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
A Gen Z kid’s thoughts on the elections,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/401957/a-gen-z-kids-thoughts-on-the-elections/,"03:32 PM April 29, 2022","For the past few months, the many candidates vying for the different positions in the government have been trying their very best to sway potential voters in their favor. And for a lot of them, their advertisements and promotional materials have been focused on the youth—the first-time voters in Generation Z from the age of 18 to 24. Though a nonvoter due to my birth date being a few months after the guidelines set by the Commission on Elections, I am happy to see that all of the candidates hoping for a seat in office recognize the importance of this generation, and the potential that we have for the future of the country in the many different fields that we like to specialize in. More opportunities from government organizations and companies have popped up in the past decade for young people to express themselves and, for the most part, it has been quite positive, something that should be credited to the current crop of politicians. Nevertheless, I cannot help but look into what we want in our politicians. Certainly, a politician’s role in our society is extremely important to the well-being of us all. The amending of laws and current policies that are inefficient and outdated allows for a better functioning government as a whole. Moreover, the passage of new laws that align to our ever-changing world allows for the country and its citizens to not fall behind to the rest of the world, keeping us at par with some of the more technologically advanced and capable nations around the globe. Despite this, I at times find it very difficult to understand why we need to wait for the so-called next administration, next Congress, or just the next group of politicians to hold power, before we as a community start the change that we so ever desire. Shouldn’t we all do something right now that impacts our community, instead of toggling through our social media for hours? Can’t we all try to improve ourselves, some way, somehow so that we could be of valuable service to other people in the near future? Yes, I 100-percent support and agree that voicing out your concerns is important, and is integral to a well-oiled democracy. With so much misinformation and disinformation littering the internet, it is important that information going in is properly filtered. However, at times, it just feels that we as the youngest generation have been very hypocritical with the current state of woke culture threatening the definition of true change for the community, leading to more intimidation and hate being spread online. As a result of the current structure of how social media functions nowadays, it promotes constant bickering and fighting between the people who have totally opposing views, causing online feuds and insults to be thrown at one another. For instance, our desire to be correct causes a “crab mentality” where where we feel it necessary to stomp over other people. As media companies out there have put the majority of their resources on the campaign trail of the aspiring candidates, it has caused people to be overly loyal to the candidate of their choosing. This totally omits from the picture those who desperately need the news features and front page stories—the less fortunate who have been affected by alcoholism, abuse, natural disasters and mental health issues, to name a few. What is perplexing is the fact that despite the country seeing a reported increase in depression and anxiety, as well as numerous natural disasters that have displaced many during the COVID-19 pandemic, many media stations still would rather flood their pages to report on the drama that surrounds the political landscape. Yes, politics is important, but with so many Filipinos who are unemployed and limping through the past two years of the health crisis, is it really necessary to report about those never-ending fights? Why not focus more on the farmers, the doctors, the students, the micro, small and medium enterprises, and so many more who have been negatively affected? Especially at the moment with this campaign period, it is confusing to see the news articles on political endorsements and the money involved in the process, when there are other key issues that should be prioritized over this political polarization. Creating division in the campaigning season will only bring about more challenges to the succeeding administration. In addition, with a lot of these politicians getting huge sums of money from us to push their political agenda and enrich the countless different media outlets nationwide, it is not surprising to see how many of those that actually need the money are not receiving it. With the huge sums of money pumped into these political campaigns that create hate and division in society, I wonder why this money can’t be given to those that are affected by the Marawi crisis, or those that are affected by the natural disasters, or given to nonprofit and nongovernment organizations that help those who are suffering from depression, heart diseases, cancer, violence and so much more. Yes, the government has a significant slice in the blame pie for the problems that this country faces. However, we also deserve a part of the slice as well for some of the issues in the Philippines. The overreliance that we have on one person and one government to somehow be able to change the country in a six-year term in office is bogus and unfair to them. Despite being given the position by the electorate, recognizing that the country will not be able to progress without our on-the-ground action is important as well in becoming a better Philippines. —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Lessons from rest and silence,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/401030/lessons-from-rest-and-silence/,"09:40 PM April 18, 2022","“Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.”—Genesis 2:1–2 Anyone who has ever heard the creation story according to the Bible knows that God created the universe step by step. On this day, he made that. On that day, he made this. And then he created human beings. But what’s interesting is that in the verse that I just cited above, the Lord is said to have actually rested. Yes, the good Lord, the creator of the universe, the “unmoved mover,” is portrayed to have rested. After all the action, all the creating, all the moving around and all the breathing of life, there was rest; there was silence and stillness, one can probably deduce. A similar silence to that of the creation story echoed yesterday, Black Saturday. It’s the silent day when we wait for the glorious resurrection of Jesus. The hours before the great Easter Vigil are hours of silent anticipation. Now, of course, these events that we commemorate during Lent happened 2000 years ago. And Jesus is already risen from the dead and is in Heaven. But I think it’s also great to remember that there was, indeed, also a silence, a sort of quietness in between Jesus’ death and his glorious resurrection. After Jesus rose from the dead, I can only imagine the scene in heaven of choirs and choirs of angels singing the praises of God. I can only imagine the joy of Jesus’ disciples, too. I know, all this seems “religious-y,” and I get that sentiment. But make no mistake: I think we can draw great lessons from rest and silence. We live in an overly and unnecessarily fast-paced world. Every second has to be filled with work. Every second has to be productive. Rest should be minimized; work and power have to be maximized all the time! And when one does get some time off, there’s that guilty feeling that “we aren’t being productive” and that “we’re wasting time.” I say foul. If the holiest of Christian writings portrays the Lord God as having rested, why in the world should we, finite humans, deprive ourselves of it? Now, of course, I’m not saying we should be lazy. We have duties as fathers, mothers, students, employees and the like. But why are we so presumptuous to think that we can function at our best without adequate rest when we legitimately need it? There’s this philosophy in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) called yin-yang. Without going into too much detail, yin is associated with cold temperatures, relaxation, sleep and darkness. Yang, on the other hand, is associated with hot temperatures, activeness, energy, fire and brightness. As you can see, yin and yang complement each other. If you want to be active (yang), then you must have the sleep (yin) to fuel your activeness. If there is a day (yang), there also has to be a night (yin). If sometimes we feel so happy and energetic (yang), there are also moments in life wherein we have to slow down (yin). The key is balance. The Chinese philosophy of yin-yang is all about balance. And yet, what society wants and expects from us—and as a result, what we expect from ourselves—is to have so much yang. More work, more overtime, more this, more that, just more, and more and more. And we know all too well the effects of that: a drastic decline in mental health and the rise in suicide rates, broken families (due to absent parents who always have to work) and unnecessarily high expectations. Have we not experienced these things in our own lives? Again, I’m not saying we should all just slack off and be negligent in our duties. What I’m saying is that—and I think both Catholic theology and TCM would agree with me—balance in life is absolutely necessary. Silence is necessary. Rest is necessary. Promoting balance is something we can practice in our own lives. But change also has to be societal and wide scale. Absolutely everyone should be involved! My prayer is that we, in our personal lives and society as a whole, rediscover balance in life, that we rediscover the value of simplicity and rest. Oh, what a wonderful world it would be if only all of us were simpler. May you have a most blessed Easter season ahead! —CONTRIBUTED INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022

PH and int’l art community confront COVID in new book,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/400547/ph-and-intl-art-community-confront-covid-in-new-book/,"05:59 PM April 10, 2022"," At the beginning of the March 2020 lockdown, so many aspects of our lives were categorized based on their supposed necessity. Food and groceries were, naturally, essentials, as were workers in the said industry. Public transportation, for some reason, was not. Places that were deemed nonessential—theaters, amusement parks, gyms—were closed. Major museums were the first ones to close, days ahead of March 15. It would’ve been easy then to categorize art and all that it encompasses—film, shows, theaters—as nonessential. But that was not the case, as the art community quickly showed during the first weeks of the lockdown. International theater productions streamed their shows for free to keep people at home; some of the best museums of the world opened free virtual tours of their halls. In the Philippines, Art Rocks, a community of doctors, artists and collectors, raised P14 million to buy and import thousands of test kits from South Korea, at a time when test kits were very much needed but scarce. Artists donated their works for the cause, and Art Rocks members used different platforms to sell the pieces. “The art scene was actually very, very essential at that point,” said curator and museum director Ricky Francisco, who became a little emotional recalling the fundraising efforts of the art community. “A lot of people were saying food lang ang essential, but keeping the morale up, showing solidarity, these were all important at that point in time, and the book will actually show that,” he added. Francisco was referring to “Brave New World,” a compilation of more than 400 artworks and essays that reflect life during the ongoing pandemic. Published by South East Asian Heritage Publications Inc., the book gathers more than 300 artists from the local and international scene who shared their experiences, observations and realizations during the unprecedented global health crisis. “Brave New World” captures how art became not just a companion during the turbulent times of the lockdown, but an inspiration, and a means to help those around them. The book also touched on the social impacts of art in society, as evidenced by the meaningful works by artists. “This is going to be a historical contribution to our children and grandchildren,” the curator added. Among the 400-plus works included are Michael Cacnio’s “Kwadro” pieces—miniature sculptures of figures that depict life during one of the harshest lockdowns in the world. “New Normal” shows a mom giving her son a haircut at home—something that Cacnio himself witnessed in his own home. “Artists are shaped by everything around them. That’s why during the pandemic, I was inspired by what was happening,” he told Lifestyle in an interview. Cacnio, a trained painter, also turned to sketching during the long period that he was not allowed to visit his studio. He also kept himself busy with chores and reading the Bible. Painter Don Bryan Bunag, whose work titled “Bugtong at Hininga” appears in the book, said he initially had a hard time processing the crazy turn of events brought by the lockdown. He was supposed to have a show at the Cultural Center of the Philippines, but that was canceled for obvious reasons. Eventually, he realized that he was not supposed to stop creating. He learned printmaking during the lockdown. But more importantly, he learned more about art during that tumultuous period. “I realized that leading a career in art is not just on an individual aspect. Being an artist is not about the self, but how you connect your work to society,” he said. Writers also contributed essays that supplemented the works. There were those who wrote about coping and thriving during the uncertain situation, like Purissima Benitez-Johannot. Jose Tence Ruiz wrote about the palpable physical distance brought by COVID-19. Jack Teotico penned an essay on the importance of art post-COVID-19. Prim Paypon of The Dream Project touched on the “ambitious” yet successful project of Art Rocks, which brought thousands of testing kits to the Philippines and donated them to hospitals. “It was a very beautiful thing to be included in the book because for us at Art Rocks, it was really an episode where the artist rocked for the brave new world,” Paypon said. “Why? Because artists used their talent to create visual narratives, to empower. But more interesting to note is that Art Rocks is a community of doctors, at the same time fighting for their lives every day as medical front-liners, and for that book to capture that essence of generosity of artists and the essence of service among front-liners is actually very beautiful.” He added: “I think the book celebrated as a whole what the Philippines is known for—that we’ll always be a nation of resilient and generous people. That we give not because we have an excess of things; we give because we have the capacity to give, despite and in spite of.” “Brave New World” offers different perspectives of the pandemic, according to book editor Jewel Chuaunsu. The essays and artworks were also supplemented with photos to provide context to the COVID-19 situation in the country, she said. “I think with the artists, looking at the works they contributed to ‘Brave New World,’ there’s really a whole range of subjects,” the Art Plus Magazine managing editor said. “There are some who were very introspective, or painted about the isolation that they were feeling … Some painted about what’s happening around us, whether it was people waiting for ayuda or the struggles of jeepney drivers, or you know, paying the bills, some fears about going back to work. “It’s very powerful to see your own experience and what society is going through reflected in artworks. Just looking through all the main things you’ll come up with your own interpretations, some more than others,” she said. Creating the book also allowed the galleries, artists and editors to catch up and check on each other. Artists have always been working from home, said Chuaunsu, but like the rest of the world, they also struggled with their own mental health during the prolonged isolation. “So your art helps to release your emotions and to reach out and I think that this is really what artists do—they bear witness to the times and that’s their gift to people and that is also what we get from it,” she said. It’s a rare event for so many artists and members of the art community to band together in one project, according to the organizers. But at this point, it shouldn’t come as a surprise, given how the art community stepped up during the darkest of times in the beginning of the lockdown. “The art scene, artists, gallerists, collectors, they were all very involved in a bigger, social phenomenon. They were reaching out to society when there was no certainty, when we were hopeless, when we were desperate,” said Francisco. “That’s why it’s a brave new world. By helping each other out, we can create something really good. We should not allow desperation to overcome us, but we should reach out so we can make the world a better place out of this,” he added. “Brave New World” is available at artplus.shop.

Dealing with anxiety and depression? You are not alone,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/400049/dealing-with-anxiety-and-depression-you-are-not-alone/,"05:42 PM April 01, 2022","To paraphrase a quote by Johnny Depp, “Having anxiety or depression isn’t a sign you’re weak; it’s because you’ve been strong for too long.” One of the most primal survival tools of any living organism is the “fight or flight” mechanism. As we encounter problems, challenges, or even day-to-day stress, our body is faced with a question: Do I run away or do I stand up and face the music? Now imagine that our body has to do this constantly every day. As each situation passes, tension builds up, and when this goes unaddressed, something’s bound to break. This often results in two of the most common mental disorders: anxiety disorder and depression. I’m sure as you’re reading this, the term “mental disorder” already has a few negative connotations that come to mind. “Is that the same as being crazy?” would probably pop up. To put things quite bluntly, no, it doesn’t mean you are crazy. There is a lot of stigma, especially in our culture, about mental disorders. These mental health issues are often bottled up and lead to many missed diagnoses and consequently, alienation for those experiencing them. In reality, these should be openly discussed as more and more people need help. The recent pandemic has been a double-edged sword. Yes, it’s one of the worst calamities that has happened to humanity in recent memory with thousands of deaths and infections, but it also somehow changed the way we view mental health. Since we’re all essentially in the same boat, most people find it easier to relate to each other when talking about stress, anxiety, and even depression. In this regard, more awareness has been given to these all-important topics. Just what is anxiety disorder and depression? How are they different from just being agitated or sad? Let’s try to take a deeper dive into the topic, but before we begin, let me just point out that I am neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist. I have, however, talked to a lot of people about these topics in my live streams in 2020 and have also experienced both. I’m here to give you a (somewhat) less technical but (hopefully) more relatable take on the topic. According to Medlineplus.gov, mental disorders are “conditions that affect your thinking, feeling, mood, and behavior. They may be occasional or long-lasting (chronic). They can affect your ability to relate to others and function each day.” The operative phrase here is that these disorders can affect your ability to function or perform day-to-day tasks. You can be scared or sad, but if it doesn’t have any significant repercussions in the grand scheme of things, technically it’s not a disorder. Now after learning this, the term “mental disorder” doesn’t seem so bad, right? In reality, there’s a wide spectrum of disorders that range from very mild to rather serious. To generalize them as “all the same” is, quite frankly, wrong. Just like mental disorders, there are several types of anxiety disorders. For our purposes, let’s focus on the common qualities they possess. Aside from the earlier point I mentioned (i.e. that it affects our ability to function), anxiety disorders have two significant qualities: an overreaction to stimuli and a lack of control of these responses. In essence, what it’s saying is that when something stresses you out, your reaction to the whole matter is disproportionate and even illogical to the problem. On top of this, no amount of “calming down” can help. Oftentimes, these manifest in things like palpitations, restlessness, chest pains, or even obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Depression (a.k.a. major depressive disorder) is a more specific type of mood disorder. I chose to use this term because it’s more widely used and relatable for a lot of people. But in essence, mood disorders, like anxiety disorders, share the following qualities: symptoms that interfere with daily living and a disconnect between what you feel and the current circumstances. Depression is one of the most common illnesses and has regularly been linked to substance abuse disorder, self-harm, and even suicide, making it a serious area of concern. Again, let me point out that there are more disorders out there, but I chose to focus on these two because of their prevalence. They also give a peek into the qualities of mental disorders without adding too much complexity. In simple terms, excessive anxiety is an overreaction to stimulus. A little inconvenience (if at all) blows up disproportionately. At times, you might not know what exactly you are stressing over, which adds even more anxiety. The amount of stress is magnified several-fold and it can feel like there is no way of controlling it. Depression meanwhile seems like the opposite. The individual could feel numb to stimuli. Happy moments seem dull while stressful moments imbue a sense of despair or lack of importance. In both cases, we are out of touch with what is actually presented upon us. There is nothing wrong with how we perceive things, yet there is a disconnect between what we experience and what we actually feel. There are a lot of causes and theories surrounding mental disorders. From genetic predisposition and chemical imbalances to injury and trauma, it’s hard to pinpoint a single cause. Rather, think of it as an amalgamation of various factors that led to this. In general, more often than not, there usually has to be a trigger (whether acute or chronic) that causes this particular problem. Without delving into specifics, a top view assessment of this matter is the “overuse” or dysfunction of the fight or flight response. Yes, our body needs stress to function; without stress as a stimulus, we can’t get things done. Stress, in many ways, brings out the best in us. The problem arises when there’s too much stress and our body can’t handle it anymore. It can be because of the magnitude of the stressor or the lack of rest to recuperate from it. This is the tipping point that breaks our state of well-being. There are a lot of things that can be done to address mental disorders with relative success. Antidepressants, therapy, exercise, and alternative medicine are just a few. One thing that doesn’t work as well as we’d hope though is self-treatment. Imagine being stuck in a ditch; you’d have a hard time pulling yourself out of it. You need help. It can start with a loved one, a trusted friend, or a companion. Admitting you need help and reaching out to someone is usually the first step but oftentimes, it shouldn’t be the last. Seeking professional help is the best course of action. The first and most important step is to listen. A lot of times, people dealing with these problems just need to let things out. In sharing, there is understanding; in understanding, there is clarity. If you’re going through anxiety and depression, you’re probably trying to make sense of what’s happening around you. By confiding in someone, you are somehow grounded in reality. This is where healing begins. It’s also important to not try to fix the person if you’re not a qualified professional. Giving advice is a normal reaction and is probably well-meaning. However, for deeper and more complicated problems, it’s best to leave it to the experts. Don’t embody “toxic positivity” toward the person involved. “Think positive!” “Wala lang ’yan!” “Kaya mo ’yan.” While they might mean well, these statements do nothing for the anxious or depressed person. In doing so, we end up brushing their feelings as “OA” or exaggerated without taking into account what they’re actually going through. Lastly, lead them toward a health professional when they’re ready. Don’t ever force them by saying “this is for your own good.” Rather, patiently hold their hand and let them understand the benefits for themselves. Remember, they are probably not being stubborn but instead have a hard time climbing out of the hole they’ve been stuck in. If you are dealing with anxiety and depression, I’ll end this article with something that has resounded with me during the toughest times: You are not alone.

The entertainment anchor talked about one of her activities from her health routine, in her Instagram page yesterday, March 29, where she showed her hyperbaric oxygen therapy session. “I really love the feeling after every session that’s why I keep going back at least once a week. It balances my mood, I feel great after and my skin really looks better immediately,” she said. Fullido explained how the process works: “[It] fills the blood with enough oxygen to repair tissues [and] cells and restore normal body function and heals wounds and injuries faster. It also helps strengthen the body’s immune system among many other healing and health benefits.” She stayed in a pressurized chamber for almost two hours with no phones. She was able to relax and recommended fans to try it. Aside from taking care of her physical and mental health, Fulllido is also known as a dog lover, a plantita and environmentalist.

"Hair today, art tomorrow: Filipino salon owner uses own hair to create portraits",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/399158/hair-today-art-tomorrow-filipino-salon-owner-uses-own-hair-to-create-portraits/,"12:19 PM March 23, 2022","  MANILA, Philippines — Every few months when Jesstoni Garcia takes electric clippers to his head, he’s not just giving himself a haircut, he’s also harvesting art materials. Using a thin brush and clear, sticky resin, the co-owner of a Manila hair salon sprinkles these collected strands and clippings on a blank white canvas, taking two to five hours to arrange them into striking images of musicians and actors. The 32-year-old’s main job as a seaman involves spending up to eight months a year on cruise ships, and lacking adequate art supplies like paint and sketchpads at sea, Garcia in 2021 turned to using his own hair to create images. He started with self-portraits and eventually moved on to depicting celebrities. Away at sea much of the time, rather than in his salon, he uses only his own hair, sometimes shaving his sideburns when he needs extra material. Garcia said making this art helps ease his stress as long voyages take a toll on his physical and mental health. “We need to have an outlet to deal with depression. For me, my outlet was making art,” he said, adding that he eventually wants to sell his work.

The real failure is if we do not try,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/398987/the-real-failure-is-if-we-do-not-try/,"05:17 PM March 19, 2022","March 20—Third Sunday of Lent Readings: Exodus 3:1-8a, 13-15; Psalm 103, R. The Lord is kind and merciful.; 1 Corinthians 10:1-6, 10-12; Gospel – Luke 13: 1-9 At the beginning of this pandemic over two years ago, some said this was a punishment from God. Others quickly shot this down. The Pope framed it well. In his reflections he stated that this was not a time of judgment by God, but a time for us to make our judgment on what really matters in our lives. It is a time to reboot our lives through a genuine soul-searching and reconnecting with God and with our essential relationships. It is a call to repentance to all, sinners and saints, by a God—in the words of Einstein—who is mysterious but not malicious. The two tragic stories in today’s Gospel highlights this. The Galileans and the 18 killed by the tower of Siloam met their tragic end not because of their sins, as Jesus pointed out. The stories, rather, highlighted the call to repentance. The Parable of the Fig Tree follows the two stories. Note, this is not the same story as the fig tree that the Lord cursed. The fig tree is Israel, but the “stars” of the story are the owner of the orchard and the gardener. The owner wanting to cut down the fig tree was just and fair. Contextual note, fertile land was a scarce resource so it was judicious to cut a none performing asset, so to speak. But there was another quality of the owner. He was patient and merciful, a mercy that found expression in giving second chances. The gardener had a key role in this parable. He was the intercessor that won the fig tree a reprieve. I’d like to invite you to focus your reflections on the gardeners in your life. Who were the people who interceded for you? Who were the ones who were willing to go out on a limb for you? Who were the ones who were willing to care for you, nurture you to bear fruit, love you into excellence? In one study conducted by Gallup a decade ago, they surveyed people who excelled at work. One of the key factors contributing to their success at work was how a teacher in college or vocational school took interest in them to encourage and mentor them. Another study, “The Mentoring Effect,” showed similar findings. Those who had some form of mentoring, whether informal or formal, performed better in school, did well at work, engaged more in volunteer work and assumed leadership roles. The other nurturing function of the “gardeners” in our life is accompanying us through the experience of failure. This was one major concern we had when I was doing high school work close to 30 years ago. Even then we started to look at mental health concerns among the youth, seeing how easily they give up when faced with adversity. This has evolved into what we can consider as an epidemic, if not a pandemic, as we see the rise of cases among the youth worldwide especially during the past two years of the pandemic. Facing, coping and learning from failure has only one pedagogical approach—fail. We do not plan for failure, but inevitably we will experience failure just like the rest of humanity. We teach them not to plan for failure, but also not to fear failure and make its reality part of the equation. This is a very important role of a mentor, a teacher, a formator. Something society does not at all bring into the consciousness of people. The final role of the “gardener” I wish to reflect on is the “fertilizing” of the ground, creating and nurturing environments of care and compassion. Chris Lowney pointed to this as one of the key elements in the formation of the Jesuits in his book “Heroic Leadership.” It is an environment of care which provides people opportunities to achieve their full human potential. This is what I advocate as creating safe spaces in our home and communities where the members, especially the young, can discover, express, be themselves without fear of judgment and rejection. This basic ground of trust and a sense of security allows them to venture into the world. Then there is the sacred space, where one discovers transcendence in one’s life—God, God’s mission for you and God’s vision for our world. “‘Sir, leave it for this year also, and I shall cultivate the ground around it and fertilize it; it may bear fruit in the future. If not, you can cut it down.’” (Luke 13: 9) As gardeners we make this plea and put our lives on the line with faith and hope in the future, in our youth. We know we can fail and still end up with the cutting of the tree. But the real failure is if we do not try.   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022

Back on campus after two years—here’s what it’s like,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/397528/back-on-campus-after-two-years-heres-what-its-like/,"04:11 PM February 25, 2022","After almost two years of online learning, Far Eastern University (FEU) Manila gradually opens its doors to its junior and senior students for lectures and laboratories, introducing the hybrid learning setup, which consists of both online and in-person classes. Communication seniors who are due to graduate this year have missed out on a considerable amount of their college life which was inevitably affected by the pandemic. As restrictions on the education system ease, students, especially seniors, are excited to attend their classes for one final semester before they enter the “real world.” Jessa Doydora, a fourth-year Digital Cinema major from Quezon City, says she’s eager to study even more given that an in-person setup is the ideal learning environment for her. “I’ve suffered enough time mentally just to be safe from the virus,” she said, and to her, the risks that come with attending classes physically are worth it. During the first day of in-person classes, Doydora said her energy shifted immediately and felt recharged. “For someone whose love language is physical touch, I am genuinely happy. With the online setup, I rarely open my camera or microphone—zero interactions at all. But in-person, I’ve been talking with a lot of people and became active in class discussion,” she said. For Nickey Zacate, a senior Digital Cinema major from Caloocan City, said “It was a nostalgic feeling for me going back to school. It’s like I’m a freshman again.” Zacate prefers in-person classes. “On campus you will feel your productivity in learning and it separates your workspace from your safe space and that will help your mental health.” Portia Barrientos, also a senior student from Quezon City, said she’s excited to see her friends and build memories together. “Of course, I also want to learn in school but my desire to be with my friends is more dominant because I feel like I can’t complete my college life without making memories with them—happy, sad, funny or even the fights that will make you laugh afterward. I know those are the things I will go back to when I graduate,” she said. When the online learning setup was introduced at the beginning of the pandemic, the barriers between spaces where students study and where they relax became almost nonexistent. Doydora said, “Distractions are everywhere when studying at home, especially for those who have family issues. You also have chickens crowing in the morning, neighbors having the time of their lives with the karaoke machine, dogs barking. Hearing all that while doing a report in class . . . it’s chaos.” But online classes offered advantages for some students. Doydora said, “It’s beneficial for working students or students who have their own small businesses. Instead of choosing to do one thing at a time, I can manage to fix my clients’ orders while attending class.” Doydora runs a small business selling plants. Zacate said, “It was fast and convenient for those of us who can have online classes but I wish every student in the Philippines also had that kind of opportunity.” A lot of students especially from the rural areas have struggled in coping with the online setup. Barrientos said discipline when it comes to time management is very important for online learning. “All the work you do online can be a bit confusing and heavy because you’re doing all the work in the house where you’re supposed to be resting. You really need to make time for specific tasks and you also need to give time for you to rest.” Online learning continues to be the main setup for most colleges and universities and many students, especially those in production courses, are losing out on important lessons. Doydora said, “I should have met a lot of people and learned from them as I love listening to other people’s stories and bringing them with me . . . Aside from this, my art was also affected. I died as the pandemic started.” Zacate shared he’s bummed out by the online setup, “especially because I’m a communication major. Our courses depend heavily on in-person productions to have good execution of filming our projects. But because of the pandemic we learned to be flexible and adapt to the current situation.” Before the pandemic, being part of the Far Eastern University Theater Guild took up a lot of Barrientos’ time. She ruminated about the things she missed out on. “I didn’t have the chance to meet and make a lot of friends aside from my org mates. I don’t have a picture of me wearing my uniform on campus.” It’s important for her to be back in school, she said. “I also hope to watch a lot of events there.” Socializing with friends and meeting new people have been one of the biggest problems that everyone, not only students, struggled with because of the restrictions put in place. Student did get to meet new classmates and friends through the online setup but, Zacate said when it came to see these online friends in person, “It was awkward to approach a classmate that I only met online.” Barrientos feels the same way. “I don’t know if I’ll greet them or not because it seems a bit awkward . . . when it’s online, it’s easy to talk to people, but when it’s in person, it’s embarrassing to make the first move because there’s actual (physical) interaction.” But meeting those new friends with open arms has been a sight to see inside the campus, as everyone felt safe with the safety protocols implemented by the university. There were shifting schedules, where from Mondays to Wednesdays, juniors are the only students allowed to enter the campus, and seniors have to take their classes online, while on Thursdays to Saturdays, it’s the opposite. There were also sanitation areas, as well as trash cans specifically for discarding face masks. Each building also had its own time-in system where each student had to tap their IDs to register, which also aids in contact tracing. There are also different common areas where students can relax and wait for the next class while keeping themselves safe. The university feels different, especially with the low number of students on campus at any given time. But it’s still a great feeling being back inside the campus where you grew to discover what you wanted to pursue in life. In-person attendance is not required by the university but it says it’s highly recommended to maximize learning potential. As different universities and colleges plan to reopen their schools, one thing is for certain, students prefer to study in-person rather than facing a screen all day. Barrientos said, “I’m used to seeing the school full of students, now there are very few. Even on campus, you can feel something is missing . . . as if there is not much life inside.” —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022

"The complicated Kanye West in ‘Jeen-Yuhs,’ as told by an old fan",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/397385/the-complicated-kanye-west-in-jeen-yuhs-as-told-by-an-old-fan/,"03:17 PM February 22, 2022","Warning: This article contains mentions of mental health issues, bipolar disorder, and racism. This also contains spoilers for the first part of “Jeen-Yuhs.” Open secrets are complicated for a lot of people. As for mine, it’s this: I’m a fan of Kanye West. As anyone tuned into pop culture, the topic of Kanye West is as divisive as it comes. His name (or his new one, Ye) sits across the news in a negative light, thanks to his outbursts and questionable thoughts of the day. But deep beneath, probably forgotten by the public, is the musician who’s been dubbed a “genius.” Then, there was me, who sat in the middle. In 2004, my brother played Kanye’s debut CD “The College Dropout” inside our car while we were waiting for our parents. At that point in time, the sixth track “Spaceship” had left a mark on me because of an obsession I had—as kids do—for anything that was vaguely related to outer space. Years later, I was able to reflect on its lyrics, realizing what it was really about: overworked laborers who fought the toils of capitalism, who longed for a “spaceship” for them to disappear.  I was stuck in the rabbit hole of Kanye’s discography like a staple in my coming-of-age score. The music video for “Heard ’Em Say” was embedded on my Friendster profile, which, in hindsight, felt like a gloomy spot in an otherwise glittered-out space with its allusions to racial profiling.  When Kanye came to Manila for his first performance, the bottled-up energy I had hoarded in a decade was released, just as when the first beats of “Stronger” blasted with the rapper himself emerging from the hanging lights. My relationship with Mr. West is fickle, to say the least. Kanye’s controversies are a list that piles up in a seemingly endless loop. By 2009, I’d also branded the lyrics of Taylor Swift’s “Fearless” in my mind, tucked next to those of Kanye’s “808s & Heartbreak,” both lovelorn in their own ways, but both I adored. It was the same year when the infamous MTV Video Music Awards moment had happened, when two of my most-played artists had been on stage. In the case of his public perception, things went downhill from there. There’s that time he claimed Bill Cosby was innocent, that time he said slavery was a “choice,” and that time he outspokenly supported  Donald Trump. Most recently, Billie Eilish landed on his “hit list” because she helped a fan, and his Instagram feed appears like an obsessive ex-husband leveling threats at his soon-to-be-ex-wife’s new boyfriend. It’s during these moments that lyrics from Ye’s self-aware song come to the forefront of fans’ minds: “I miss the old Kanye.”  In the middle of these recent issues comes a documentary 22 years in the making, filmed by Kanye’s friend Coodie Simmons who had grabbed a camera, wanting to capture the growth of West who he believed would become big someday. Helmed by Simmons and directing partner Chike, the three-part “Jeen-Yuhs” feels like the closest glimpse to the “old Kanye” that old-time fans have been, more often than not, nostalgic about. But besides these are those previously unseen by the public, dimmed by stardom. In its first act aptly titled “Vision,” a pre-fame Kanye West is a name shared with emcees, particularly due to his sought-after beats. He made it to the big leagues with Jay-Z’s “Izzo (H.O.V.A.),” but for West, production wasn’t the last stop. It was rapping.  In one scene, he takes his retainers on and off to rap for execs from Jay-Z’s Roc-A-Fella Records. This was a demo of “All Falls Down,” a future breakthrough track. They all ignored him, unimpressed, as he kept going from one room to another, looking for potential listeners. Still, the trademark Kanye confidence continued on. This is the semblance of the “new Kanye” that never really did leave. He finds himself in rapper feuds and the subject of diss tracks. His arrogance shows up almost like a permanent accessory, there to define him.  Then, sometimes, it sheds. After a series of rejections, the scene shifts to Kanye flying back to his hometown of Chicago right to his mother Donda’s apartment. In a rare moment of doubt from Kanye, his mom is quick to reassure him. Simmons’ voiceover speaks over the scene: “It was easy to see the confidence Kanye had in himself was because of the confidence Donda had in him.” But Donda—who passed away in 2007—leaves a few things. “You have a lot of confidence that come off a little arrogant even though you’re humble,” she reminds him. “But it’d be important to remember that the giant looks in the mirror and sees nothing.” Later on, he finally gets what he wants and gets signed under the label—but Donda’s words feel like a reminder like a cloud hanging over Kanye, even until now. “Jeen-Yuhs” isn’t exactly a puff piece or a redemption arc. Kanye demanded “final edit and approval” weeks before it hit streaming and Sundance Film Festival. Simmons had refused, and there are moments in the film that didn’t flatter West.  The documentary shows the complicatedness of Kanye West that fans had to wrestle with in the last decade or so. “Jeen-Yuhs” talks about West’s issues with bipolar disorder, which has been the subject of discourse. It isn’t something to be romanticized and it can be unpleasant to see, especially under the public eye. This is a factor to think about when talking about West, but it shouldn’t be considered a pass to the people he has hurt. After watching the film, fans like me don’t have definite answers to the questions we have. Do we feel sorry? Do we get angry? Both feel valid at times, but just like “Jeen-Yuhs,” fans have always had a complicated relationship with Kanye West. But then again, so does he. “Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy” is currently streaming.

Some personality types suffered most during COVID,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/397162/some-personality-types-suffered-most-during-covid/,"05:21 PM February 17, 2022","The quality of our life is a mirror of the quality of our thoughts, beliefs and mindset. If your mental health suffered during the pandemic, take this as a feedback that something has to change. There are personality types that suffered the most during the pandemic. If you fall under any of these categories, here are some tips to shift your mindset. 1. Your sense of self is dependent on others. We call this type the others-referent. As the term suggests, they need to refer to what other people think and want, before they can decide for themselves. Having limited social interaction makes them feel at a loss because the people they depend on for praise or feedback are harder to come by. If this is you, it’s time to get to know yourself better and have a choice in your own life. Who do you want to be, and how do you want to live your life? 2. Extroverts. We define extroverts as those who get their energy from being with people. Isolation is most challenging for them because it feels like their whole world has disappeared. While many think that extroversion is permanent, this can actually be adjusted. One can learn to be an introvert or an ambivert. It starts with finding ways to enjoy one’s own company, and learning to recharge from solo activities and from one’s environment. Communing with nature, listening to music, tapping into your artistic side are great ways to start. 3. In relationships for the wrong reasons. The pandemic was make-or-break for many couples. While many chose to get married, many also broke up. Couples whose relationships didn’t have strong foundations or who didn’t have the right reasons for being together felt the burden of attachment. If they lived together, they started to realize that they feel lonely even with their partners around. If they lived apart, they realized their way of communication wasn’t healthy and effective. This is a good time to reboot, find who you are solo, and have criteria for a better partner. 4. Can’t deal with their own thoughts. Those who have been escaping their own thoughts and emotions didn’t have any choice but to be confronted with their inner demons. Many of the escapes aren’t easily accessible and they’re forced to deal with the deafening silence of the outer world, and the noise of their inner world. Writing thoughts down provides a release and a relief. Having a sounding board will help sort through the conflicting thoughts we have. The best way to quiet down the mind is to hear what it has to say. 5. Have a bad relationship with oneself. Perfectionists and people who drive themselves too hard would count here. Most people weren’t as productive and effective during the pandemic. Those who discount small progress will put pressure on themselves to do more and be more. Being kind and compassionate to oneself is key here. Imagine being a good friend to yourself. Ask yourself how you feel and what you need in the moment. Be forgiving of shortcomings. Learn to celebrate baby steps and small wins. Count the effort exerted even if results aren’t perfect and complete. 6. In the wrong profession. By wrong, we mean not the right place for them. Abraham Maslow says, “A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is to be ultimately at peace with himself.” Those who chose their profession solely for money or to please others would have no anchor to hold on to when everything seems uncertain. Every day, they feel inauthentic, and this can eat at one’s sanity and peace. Finding one’s ikigai or purpose is helpful in answering the question, “What should I be doing in life?” Even if what you’re deeply passionate about isn’t going to feed you yet, at least have it as a hobby or part-time stint. This will make your spirit come alive. 7. Have deprioritized things that matter. People realized the things that truly matter when the world seemed uncertain. Family, sense of purpose, peace of mind, whatever it is that makes life worth living—make sure it’s not compromised in the life you choose. In coaching, we call this one’s ecology. Some choices end up poisoning the other aspects of our lives. Think of yourself as one whole system where everything is interconnected. Have your values at the center of your life’s direction, decisions and choices. Any small shift is a good start. Any time is a good time. Be ruthlessly compassionate to yourself. Strive for quality and excellence while being kind to yourself. Decide to let the worst of times make you a better person and have a better life. —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022

Drilon told Lifestyle that their relationship had begun in 2008 shortly after she had been abducted by the Abu Sayyaf. Back then, Carandang was a spokesperson for the late President Benigno Aquino III. “We never really lived together,” she told Lifestyle. “We each had our own spaces, and would spend weekends at his place.” Once COVID-19 struck, Drilon was often out distributing personal protective equipment, so she stayed with Carandang for a few months to protect her son who lived with her. She returned to her house in May 2020. Considering the two weren’t spending every day together, the separation caused by the quarantine did not impact their relationship as drastically as it did others. So why break up after all that time? “The pandemic uncovered the weaknesses in our relationship,” Drilon said. A year before the pandemic, Drilon had famously told Entertainment columnist Dolly Anne Carvajal that the secret to her relationship with Carandang was that they were not married, and Drilon said that was true—at the time. “I thought it was working. I wanted us to live together. I guess I was just trying to adjust to the situation.” Joselito C. Pascual, M.D., M.Sc., says, “Weak or fragile relationships, to begin with, no matter how solid they may look on the outside, may further weaken. I think honesty is the key—that, and being in touch with one’s own issues.” It gets even worse if couples not used to being together 24/7 have to be cooped up together. “That sacred ‘me space’ is shattered when they realize that they have to keep up with each other’s behavior. They eventually realize that personal growth is stunted, and that may take its toll on each other’s mental health, which may manifest as depression, anxiety, aggression, irritability and even resentment.” Drilon says a lot of things came into focus during that time that may not have otherwise. “I kind of momentarily lost my bearings. I lost my job. I didn’t really have any purpose.” Many of the things that were normal to Drilon had been stripped away—they couldn’t even go out, for example—and all this began building up. “I was just not looking deep into it before,” she says. “I was actually questioning, before the pandemic, if I was settling. I was convincing myself, ‘No, this is good,’ when there were signs that there were already difficulties in the relationship.” The breakup was complicated by the fact that they were doing business together with produce from Carandang’s Tanauan, Batangas, farm. They had to ask themselves whether they should continue doing so. “There was an option of ending the relationship but doing business together, and that’s why I took a bit of a while to decide, ‘No, no more.’” The mutual decision to break up came relatively quickly—in just weeks. Did the possible loss of the relationship’s longevity give her pause? “No, that wasn’t even a factor at all,” she said. “I think they shouldn’t even say that because sometimes you’re thinking, wow, I wasted my youth. But, you know, don’t look at it as wasted years because they shaped you. They formed you. There were good things. Maybe there were bad things too, but it’s really part of life.”   The end still came painfully: “You allow yourself to be vulnerable in a relationship. It’s so precious. You’re so open. You’re so easily wounded. Then what happened? Just like the rug was pulled from under your feet.” But Drilon isn’t dwelling on that. “If I was not exposed to the farm, I would not have rekindled my love for plants,” she says. “And so, it meant I had to do that, too. It’s something I’d thank him for.” Drilon and Carandang ended the relationship in person on March 10, 2021 and set in place a compromise agreement regarding the farm. Though the farm is Carandang’s, they agreed that Drilon would have access to it until she has her own farm up and running. This is for Drilon’s nascent business Provenciana (provenciana.com), which sells natural remedies such as smudge sticks, insect repellent and artisanal soap whose ingredients mostly come from the farm. Drilon’s already put down a downpayment on a farm and once that is up and running, she will no longer need access to Carandang’s farm. Drilon has certainly kept busy, even after overcoming her own battle against COVID last month. She has a show on dzXL called “Basta Promdi, Lodi!” She even let her name be licensed by Linya- Linya for a T-shirt that said “Stress Drilon” and she’s now shooting a “BL” or “Boy’s Love” TV series called “Love Team.” She didn’t just work—she had to work through it. “I had to see a therapist because, in the beginning, I thought, I’m a strong woman and can really just easily get over it. I wanted to be busy, busy. I was saying, this is easy. I was desperate, too, to get over it. I was desperate to be okay. I was in denial. And so, I had to acknowledge that I was hurt.” Dr. Pascual says couples who are suffering in pandemic bubbles should “reduce expectations and think that everyone is stressed and worried especially during these times. They could seek therapy or counseling, including teletherapy.” Drilon and Carandang are not the only ones who broke up during the pandemic. Camille Arcilla is a 30-year-old senior project manager for media relations and business development in a public relations and marketing agency in Alabang. She met her now ex-boyfriend Jeffrey (not his real name) when they both worked at another company in 2012. Eventually, they both left that company and got different jobs. Jeffrey also began studying for the bar exams, which made things hard enough, as this ate into their time together. The fact that Arcilla lived in Alabang and Jeffrey in Valenzuela—opposite ends of the metro—did not help. “It was really challenging for us to work on the relationship even before the pandemic,” Arcilla says. “There were more reasons for us to try our best to work on the relationship when the pandemic happened, but other problems transpired after that.” Arcilla was hurt, for example, that Jeffrey made the effort to visit her in person during the quarantine only twice—and the second time was only because it was her birthday. “The last row actually was when he said that he was trying his best to go because I wanted him to be there. I knew that we were in the middle of a pandemic, pero I don’t think it was right for him to say that that was the reason he came, not because he wanted to go on his own.” Arcilla emphasized that their love languages—something personally important to her—were way off “so it showed some incompatibilities.” This became most obvious with one topic: “The idea of getting married.” All the other girls in Arcilla’s barkada had gotten married before or during pandemic, leaving her the only single girl standing. “Every time I tried to bring it up to him, he always brought up his bar exam. I was actually willing to wait after the bar. But the thing is, he wasn’t even open to talking about it.” She felt neglected and taken for granted. The seven years they shared was a factor that made her think twice about breaking up. “That was sad. That’s seven years and it’s ⅓ of my life.” The two had even already bought a preselling condo in Mandaluyong City in their names that needs to be paid for until 2025. It took a while before Jeffrey agreed to pay Arcilla for her share of the condo. Arcilla and Jeffrey decided on what is popularly called a “cooling-off” period. After a month, Arcilla decided enough was enough. In November 2020, she sent him a text message ending it. “I texted him a very lengthy message with all the reasons I was breaking up with him, what could have been better, what he could have done and what he could have fixed.” Jeffrey messaged saying he was going to try harder—and then proceeded to do “nothing to redeem himself,” Arcilla said. She secretly gave him a little more time, hoping he would do something, anything to prove himself. In the meantime, Arcilla had to do something she never imagined she’d have to do: date. “I asked my friends about Tinder and Bumble and I tried it out myself.” But there are times when the past would get in the way. “Sometimes, I still think I won’t be able to meet somebody who would accept me for who I am because I’d think na parang it’s just him.” Wasn’t there a serious risk of rebounding? “I was looking for someone because I already knew that it was over for us. And I don’t want to wallow in sadness. I don’t want to stick around because I think that he’s not doing anything anymore.” All this technology that allowed people to stay somehow connected has also led to the rise of virtual relationships—romance exclusively through screens, long-distance relationships without the “long” part—that some even call “quaranflings.” Dr. Pascual cautions that “oftentimes, virtual identity is different from real identity. It’s like having an inauthentic relationship, one that is not secure and has no sense of reassurance.” Ironically, Arcilla didn’t meet anyone through the dating apps. In fact, she wasn’t even looking at all in June 2021, when she was bored and just reading through the Reddit community PHR4R. “I saw his post, and we started messaging each other through Telegram.” He was Jace Siddayao, 29, who provides customer support for a luxury furniture brand based in the US. They agreed they would not exchange photos until they felt comfortable enough to do it, and so they did. They then decided to meet up that weekend. “I was supposed to do my groceries and he accompanied me,” Arcilla said. “Iba ’yung compatibility even when we were communicating without knowing what the other looked like. And it was cute because I just asked him to come with me to the grocery—first date namin ’yun—and may pa-flowers na siya kaagad.” Arcilla loves flowers and had kept dropping hints to her ex but this was dismissed as being “impractical.” The flower telepathy was a sign, apparently—as was the fact Arcilla says their love languages were almost identical, and three months later they were officially an item, aided by Telegram and video calls through Discord. Yes, theirs is a very modern romance. Yet, Arcilla remains sanguine, admitting that had the pandemic not happened, she would probably still be with Jeffrey. Arcilla and Siddayao have been living together since December in a rented Alabang condo, spending a lot of time playing “Stardew Valley” (it’s her favorite game and requires two players) on Arcilla’s Twitch channel (it was a hobby she picked up while recovering from the breakup). “Crazy, right?” How many Valentine’s Days under quarantine does the Philippines have to go through before social distancing—so counterintuitive to us—is a thing of the past? How many couples will come apart and together? Unlike her earlier relationship, Arcilla’s not making plans but is very hopeful. “We’re very early in the relationship but I haven’t given up on marriage someday.” Like her, Drilon gets to make her own choices. Does she still believe in relationships? “I don’t know,” she answered. “I mean, there are many that work.” But does she believe there is one out there for her? “I’m not looking, but what the universe will give me, I’m open to.”    CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
How to get your game face on even if you didn’t start the year right,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/396105/how-to-get-your-game-face-on-even-if-you-didnt-start-the-year-right/,"05:30 PM January 31, 2022","I know many people who were able to focus on their lifestyle and health goals despite the pandemic for the last couple of years. Some unexpected circumstances like too much social activities, travel, health issues, sickness/loss of a family member, or financial difficulties that have recently happened could still delay one’s fitness goals. If these things happen to you, try to revisit your past and analyze how you started right and what worked for you in diet and exercise. Recall how you were able to handle the challenges in your life to grow in your journey. However, the circumstances might have changed your current situation, so you need to be more flexible and try new things to modify the approaches that have worked for you effectively. Forgive yourself and reflect on what went wrong. Some things are always beyond your control, like sudden illness in the family, natural calamities, and your present home and family setup brought about by the pandemic. Do not be too hard on yourself, but focus on the things you can control, like how you can live your life and take care of your health. Consider how you eat, the amount of movement you can regularly do, and how you schedule your day. It also means looking at how you can restructure your environment and relate to the people around you. You have the greatest opportunity to live your life to the fullest, considering what you can physically do, what you can give to others, and what you can improve on when it comes to your relationship with the most important people around you. What do you need right now to fully function and be excited to face another day? Maybe you need to feel physically, mentally, and emotionally well to achieve your goals for yourself and your loved ones. Prioritize your goals and be prepared to reinvent yourself this year. To be physically well and healthy, you need to consider the three significant lifestyle aspects: food, movement, and rest. Reflect on how you can systematically start without getting overwhelmed with the necessary lifestyle tasks. Allot time for yourself during the day to improve your mental health. Stimulate your mind by reading, researching, or enrolling in courses, and recharge your mind by breathing, meditating, and relaxing. Your emotional health can be nourished by praying expressing yourself through movement, music, and communication. You can also connect with your loved ones and do simple good deeds every day. Value your time well by focusing on the positive things in life, counting your blessings, and getting excited about changes that may come your way. Be inspired by others’ accomplishments and success stories instead of comparing yourself with others and always thinking of what you don’t have. Be prepared to create your own unique story that will eventually positively affect others as well. I ran with my close friend last weekend, and we discussed staying positive this year despite a significant life transition that just recently happened to her. Her daughter just left for the States to work and study. For the first time after 25 years, she’s not focused on fully taking care of someone at home. Instead of feeling sad about her daughter’s absence, she told me about being excited to improve her work and health while supporting her husband’s lifestyle goals at the same time. Start simple and avoid that perfectionist attitude of setting ideal health goals. Initially, think of walking or accomplishing more movement daily, increasing vegetables, and gradually modifying your sleeping g habits by sleeping at least one hour earlier than usual. Instead of being too preoccupied with weight, empower yourself and strengthen your motivation by writing down your progress. When it comes to your lifestyle habits, reassess and reset daily, weekly, and monthly goals. Here are some lifestyle habits that you might want to focus on: Movement: Increasing the number of steps, total calorie burn from physical activities, frequency, and intensity of exercise Eating: Increasing fiber-rich foods like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Incorporating healthy snacks in your diet like nuts, seeds, and yogurt and improving your water intake to at least eight glasses a day Rest and recovery: Increasing total hours of sleep per day and giving more time for breathing work and meditation Commit to your goals and always be a fighter when approaching your daily challenges. Do not hesitate to ask for support from your loved ones and some professionals to help you achieve your goals. Let your strengths and weaknesses push you to make a difference.

"Gretchen Barretto to continue giving sacks of rice to hospital employees, frontliners",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/395726/gretchen-barretto-to-continue-giving-sacks-of-rice-to-hospital-employees-frontliners/,"06:23 PM January 25, 2022","After giving sacks of rice to the medical frontliners of San Lazaro Hospital last Friday, and those of St. Luke’s Global in Taguig City last Sunday, actress Gretchen Barretto is set to distribute truckloads of sacks of rice at the Philippine General Hospital today, Jan. 25. “All employees and medical frontliners will also receive a sack of rice. Total of 1,800 na sako ng special rice ang aming ipamamahagi,” Francis Simeon, Barretto’s assistant, said in an exclusive interview. (A total of 1,800 sacks of special rice will be distributed.) Dr. Cherry Abrenica, a resident doctor of San Lazaro hospital who has become a friend of Barretto, was moved by the actress’ gesture that she had an image of San Lazaro be made as a token of gratitude to the actress. “Mga 2014 o 2015 nagsimulang magbigay ng tulong ni Gretchen dito sa amin. Dinadala pa n’ya dati ang anak n’ya (Dominique) at mga pamangkin,” Dr. Abrenica said. (Around 2014 or 2015 was when Gretchen started giving us help here. She even used to bring her daughter, nieces and nephews here.) Barretto distributed 1,328 sacks of rice to the healthcare workers of San Lazaro. Present during the distribution was Barretto’s best friend Grace Medina. In another gift-giving event at St. Luke’s Global in Taguig City, Barretto and her group composed of Medina, Rusky Fernandez, and former actress and businesswoman Ana Abiera, shared 3,406 sacks of rice. Beneficiaries were employees of the said hospital, including the maintenance and security personnel, together with the medical frontliners. Barretto was apparently returning the favor as her mom Inday Barretto and her siblings were confined at the said hospital when they caught COVID-19. In the succeeding days, Barretto will distribute sacks of rice to St. Luke’s Hospital and National Children’s Hospital, both in Quezon City, and at the National Center for Mental Health in Mandaluyong City.

A new year’s gift of a positive mindset,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/394272/a-new-years-gift-of-a-positive-mindset/,"05:20 PM January 01, 2022","We hope you all had a meaningful Christmas, despite the calamity which rendered thousands of our countrymen homeless, foodless, workless and uncertain of what the future holds for them. We pray that all of us who were blessed to be spared by Typhoon “Odette” (internarional name: Rai) would find it in our hearts to assist our countrymen in need. With many Filipinos, hope springs eternal, despite any predicament they’re in. The father of a family from Palawan who lost their house and means of livelihood was profuse with gratitude that none of them was hurt, and he beamed with optimism as he answered the broadcaster interviewing him. If, in spite of negative things happening to us, we can still swim against the current and feed our minds with positive thoughts and emotions like hope, gratitude, love, compassion, humility, generosity, and the desire to share and help others though we need to be helped ourselves, then we can reap the benefits in terms of resilience, good health, happiness, peace of mind, enhancement of our personal lives and all forms of abundance from God’s bounty. If there’s one important gift we could give ourselves this coming new year, it is to constantly practice positive self-talk on ourselves. And in good, as well as in bad things, to always remain grateful to the Lord. Several years ago, after Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (Haiyan) hit Leyte, Manila Doctors Hospital and Metrobank Foundation organized a medical mission in Palo, Leyte. We met Remy and her son, who survived the killer typhoon and its 20-foot storm surge by clinging to an empty plastic water container. What was amazing in Remy was her positive outlook. Even in her dire situation, she remained generous in sharing whatever relief goods they had with other family members and neighbors who had ran out of rations. Her positive thoughts of hope, gratitude, love and compassion for those in a similar situation kept her in a healthy and positive mental state, which was a key factor in their survival and recovery. We could only wish that all calamity victims can have the same frame of mind. Many of us don’t realize it, but we’re frequently talking to ourselves through our thoughts, and this self-talk can either be positive or negative, healthy or unhealthy. If we’ve been giving ourselves a lot of negative self-talk over the years, it’s never too late to change this, and the new year would be just as opportune a time as any to do it. This very moment is the best time to make that change in mindset happen. Constantly remind yourself of God’s promise that He means us to prosper, give us a great future, and not to harm us, and you’ll see things changing within a week or two. Whenever we affirm our faith and trust in God, He’ll do just as He has assured us hundreds of times in the Bible—“Fear not!” He remains in full control, though the world seems to have spun out of its orbit and is headed for doom. This pandemic has reinforced our negative default setting, that is, to expect worst-case scenarios, rather than hoping for the best. We’ve repeatedly written that the people actually determine how this pandemic will pan out in any country. It also depends on whether the people have a victor’s mindset, or a victim’s mindset. We visualize ourselves as the victor, overcoming the virus, and surely we’ll get our lives back on track and out of this pandemic. Reducing negative self-talk can go a long way in reducing our stress level, more than any potent tranquilizer or sedative. Mental health has magnified into a major problem these days with the multifaceted stressor the virus has become. Many authors have said that whatever circumstance in life we have right now is the result of the thoughts we’ve been nurturing in the past. So if we’re happy with our lives, that means we’ve been feeding ourselves with a lot of happy thoughts, and we should continue doing so. On the other hand, if we’re not happy with our present lives, and we wish we could be healthier, sleep better at night, have better relationships and enjoy a little more abundance in life, then it can serve us well to change our thoughts. Our current circumstance does not define whether we’d be happy or not, but our current mindset does. When I was small, I remember my mother would tell us as the clock struck 12 on New Year’s Eve: “Happy thoughts, big dreams for the new year.” She taught us how to dream big, and believe in it, despite the odds. Indeed, the holy book tells us that even if we have a faith just as big as a mustard seed, we can move mountains, and cast them to the sea. The COVID mountain should not be any different. But only if we believe. As we usher in the new year, I also remember Mang Sandro, whom we met while vacationing in Boracay more than 10 years ago. He was nearly 90 years old but he looked easily 10 years younger. He still had the spring in his step as he walked from one end of the beach to the other, selling knickknacks and cheap trinkets. He looked very healthy for his age, but obviously he was not materially blessed. What was clear, though, was that he was full of joy and zest for life. He regaled the small crowd of people who gathered around him with tales of his small victories in life. We ended up buying some of the stuff he was selling. His wife had long passed away, but he was enjoying a wonderful relationship with his children and grandchildren, and tried to contribute his share to buy food and pay for their house rental and utilities. Mang Sandro was enjoying good health physically, mentally and spiritually. He said he spent the first several minutes after waking up each day thanking God for blessing him with another day to live. He made no long-term plans. He just planned what to do each day, trusting that God would provide for all his needs, and those of his family. This attitude is similar to the epiphany an Italian octogenarian had when he was shown the bill for his monthslong hospital stay for critical COVID-19 complications. He was on high-flow oxygen therapy, and the oxygen alone amounted to tens of thousands of dollars. He cried profusely, and when asked if it was due to his huge hospital bill, he replied, “No, it’s definitely not that … What I just realized was that God has been providing me with free air and oxygen for more than 80 years, and I never thanked him for it.” Truly blessed are the grateful even for small things, because they will likely get much bigger blessings. The importance of a positive mindset, as happy and healthy people like Mang Sandro would teach us, could not be exaggerated. If we fill our minds with negative thoughts day in and day out, the outcomes would likely be negative. We get sickness, failure, broken relationships and financial ruin. Negative thoughts can only attract negative things; they’re not capable of attracting positive outcomes. The reverse happens if we constantly fill our minds with positive thoughts and feelings like good health, abundance, love, compassion, gratefulness, and a desire to help and share. We’ll likely get more of these in return. We know it’s easier said than done, but the truth is, our thoughts ultimately determine what kind of health, relationships and state of life we have from hereon. And if we badly need some changes in the life we have, we just have to make an effort to change our mindset. Around five years ago, when we vacationed again in Boracay, the familiar figure of Mang Sandro with his box of trinkets was no longer there. We were told that he died a couple of years before, probably due to old age. We wished he was still there to regale us with his stories, and tell us more of his secrets to a happy and meaningful life. May the spirit of Mang Sandro’s cheerful and grateful heart fill our hearts, too, and banish all the uncertainties COVID brings, in this new year. INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Gretchen Fullido swears by plants’ power to improve one’s disposition in life,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/394377/gretchen-fullido-swears-by-plants-power-to-improve-ones-disposition-in-life/,"10:21 PM December 29, 2021","Entertainment news anchor and certified plantita Gretchen Fullido feels that planting has made her more sane and has given her “peace and tranquility” inside her home. Fullido enumerated the benefits of planting in her Instagram post today, Dec. 29, where she shared a photo of herself with her pet dogs amid various plants in the background. “With all the uncertainties and things happening around the world, it’s important to make your living space a safe haven for you and for your mental health,” she noted. Fullido said plants have given her nothing but positive vibes in her life. She said, “When I decided a few years back to make my home an indoor jungle, it really was the best solution and decision for me.”   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Gretchen Fullido (@gretsfullido) “Having so many plants inside my home really helped with my overall mood and disposition. Indoor gardening became my passion,” she added. Being a plantita is a rewarding experience for her becuase she finds joy in seeing “a little bud or signs of a new leaf.” Fullido also believes that there are “strategic spots” for putting plants around the house. “Yes! Remember… Lighting, lighting, lighting. That’s really the determining factor when you talk about placement. If you don’t have ample natural light — put them nearest your windows or invest in grow lights to help aid their growth,” she said. Aside from being a plantita and pet lover, Fullido is also an environmental advocate.

Unilab launches e-Talk series on importance of vitamins,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/393605/unilab-launches-e-talk-series-on-importance-of-vitamins/,"02:20 PM December 17, 2021","“Doc, Okay Ba ‘To?” is what patients usually ask their doctors when they seek advice on medicines, vitamins, and supplements that they need or want to take. This is now also the apt title of the webinar series recently launched by Unilab’s Vitamins Group – Enervon, Conzace, and Forti-D.  The one-hour e-talks are being hosted by the King of Talk Boy Abunda, with medical experts breaking down information about the importance of vitamins and how to better boost the body’s immunity in the New Normal. These medical facts are explained in such a way that is easier for people to understand — but accurate; no fake news. This e-talk series is very timely as the country slowly eases the restrictions and transitions into the new normal. The first episode of the webinar titled “Return to Normal” featured Dr. Joseph Adrian Buensalido, an Infectious Diseases Specialist; Dr. Maricar Esculto-Khan, an Internist-Registered Nutritionist Dietitian at the Makati Medical Center; and Dr. Naheeda Mustofa, an Internist-Nutritionist at the Asian Hospital. The episode focused on how one can keep his immunity strong and stay healthy amid the prevalent threat of COVID 19 and other diseases. Dr. Esculto-Khan stressed that for the immune system to function well, it has to be properly nourished. Dr. Buensalido likened the body’s immune system to soldiers that need the right weapons, proper training, and adequate support to defeat the enemy. Proper nutrition, therefore, is a must in the fight against diseases like COVID-19. According to the doctors, vitamin supplementation plays a key role in keeping our immune system strong. It was emphasized that B-Complex, Vitamins C, D, E, and Zinc all contribute to the strengthening of the immune system. “Nandito pa rin ‘yung kalaban, nagtatago. Syempre, very selfish ‘yang virus na ‘yan, gustong makapasok sa mga katawan natin nyan. So far, ngayon, nandyan pa rin sya, pero mukhang nagwowork yung ating mga prevention and control measures, so dapat ituloy natin [The enemy is still here, hiding. Of course, the virus is very selfish, and wants to get inside our bodies. So far, it’s (COVID) still there, but it seems the prevention and control measures we are enforcing are working, so we must continue them,)” he said. Dr. Buensalido was referring to wearing of masks; face shields, although optional, could be an added protection; hand hygiene; ventilation, especially in crowded spaces with strangers; adequate rest; proper vitamin supplementation, and vaccination. These things will not just help combat the spread of the virus, but will also boost our immunity to protect us from other diseases, he added. More than physical health, vitamins can also help with mental health – this is more relevant nowadays when we see more and more people struggle with mental health issues. The saying goes, “a healthy body would mean a healthy mind.” Dr. Naheeda agreed that vitamins not only helps physically, but also aids in keeping positive mental health. “With the proper supplementation, for those who are not able to eat well or sleep well … having a good supplementation would definitely help you sustain better mental health status, lalo na for those who are taking drinks that lower down vitamin B, make sure you have it. If you can definitely prevent it, we would love preventive medicine,” she said. In closing, Dr. Buensalido also warned people about believing everything they read online. He encouraged the public to check and double-check the information and to believe only reputable sources. It is very much notable that these e-talks will feature renowned experts in their chosen fields, which is of high value, especially in this time when false information is prevalent. The second episode, titled “Vitamin D: The Vitamin of the Decade”, also featured Buensalido and Mustofa, and ably backed up Dr. Monica Therese Cating-Cabral, head of Osteoporosis and Bone Health Clinic at the Center of Diabetes, Thyroid, and Endocrine Disorders of St. Luke’s Medical Center Global City. This episode focused on Vitamin D and its importance in the general health and immune system of one’s body. Most people have limited knowledge about Vitamin D. For most people, they only know Vitamin D as a vitamin acquired from sun exposure and its benefit to the bones, when in fact, Vitamin D helps strengthen immunity and prevent chronic diseases by keeping 36 vital organs healthy. Dr. Buensalido described Vitamin D as an “all-around assistant, helper, and coordinator” of the body. “[Vitamin D] is not the primary worker or the very reason for the benefits. But it is always involved. It always assists the main worker. So it is an assistant, and it is a great assistant,” he said. “There are observations that people with good Vitamin D levels tend to have a longer life. Some studies suggest that it may lessen the risk of heart attack, colon cancer, asthma, eczema, and many other [diseases]. It may also decrease the risk of respiratory infections, infections that pass through the airways, which include tuberculosis,” he added. Researchers are also studying whether Vitamin D can help in COVID 19 cases because of the anti-inflammatory element of the vitamin. But despite being a tropical country, studies show that a majority of Filipino urban workers are still Vitamin D deficient. Based on a study, 49.2 percent are Vitamin D deficient. The color of the skin is a significant factor on this in. A darker complexion naturally protects the human skin from the harmful effects of the sun, so it shields the body from the effects of the sunlight also. Dr. Cabral agreed that Vitamin D is really beneficial for the body and that the sun is the best and free way to boost Vitamin D levels. “But the real question is, what type of sun do we really need? Do we need the early morning sun or late afternoon? Does it really matter?” she asked. “Truth be told, the best time to acquire Vitamin D from the sun is from 10 am to 2 pm… Without sunblock and long sleeves, it is best to bask in the afternoon sun for 15 to 20 minutes at most”, Cabral said. Dr. Cabral also clarified that exposing ourselves to the sun without sunblock however, poses risks of getting skin diseases. Thankfully, we have vitamin D capsule supplements with ample dosage of 800IU available which can provide us with the Vitamin D we need without having to worry about getting skin problems. Dr. Mustofa, on the otherhand, said that Vitamin D is not only good for the skin and bones, but also for mental health. “There are studies that show low levels of Vitamin D is one of the reasons why we experience mood swings, anxiety, worsening schizophrenia, and even tingling sensations,” she said. “Calcium is more easily absorbed by the body when there is Vitamin D. If you notice, they are usually given together. If there is a good source of Vitamin D, and calcium is better absorbed, there is a balance in hormonal functions of the body. So Vitamin D benefits the body from top to bottom, physically and mentally,” said Mustofa. The Dok, Okay Ba ‘To e-talks series is targeted to resume next year.

Simple and effective wellness practices that can help you beat the holiday stress,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/393188/simple-and-effective-wellness-practices-that-can-help-you-beat-the-holiday-stress/,"01:12 PM December 13, 2021","So for the past two weeks, I’ve been hearing numerous stories from my clients who just started going out again to meet up with friends, host gatherings, attend Christmas parties, and how they experienced the holiday stress. Holiday stressors include buying gifts, fixing the house and preparing foods for gatherings, dealing with family matters, attending to the large volume of responsibilities at work/ meeting deadlines, financial issues, weight gain, drinking alcohol, and lack of sleep. Here are some effective wellness strategies you can apply before Christmas in the next few days. Parties and gatherings can stress you mentally, emotionally, and physically due to tedious preparation and lack of sleep/recovery. Plan and create the most effective schedule applicable for you at this point. Set aside time when you can breathe, relax, plan and take a moment to figure out everything in advance so you can avoid the holiday stress that can affect your health. Replace some sedentary activities that you don’t need right now with more productive activities at home. If you can devote a couple of hours to social media or Netflix, for sure, you can devote 30 minutes to move, and you can go to bed earlier to have a productive sleep. Right now, your body needs enough rest to recover so you can have more energy to face the next day. Prioritize the most important gatherings, be with people you value the most, and learn to be more assertive and say NO to time-robbers and little get-togethers. You can always save some date nights with your friends for next year. Aside from time constraints, financial issues brought about by the pandemic can stress you out. Although hybrid fitness has already started, your pre-pandemic fitness lifestyle of wearing branded workout clothes, attending daily small group classes in boutique studios, and private sessions with a personal trainer might not be realistic at this point. You can always continue minimalist workouts like online home fitness and outdoor exercises, which are the most popular fitness trends because of safety and accessibility since the start of the pandemic. Devote at least 30 minutes of your time every day to walk or run outdoors and at least 15 minutes to do simple strength training home workouts like squats, lunges, plank, push-up, and sit-ups. Ideally, pursue your workouts early morning to avoid procrastinating when you get loaded with work and holiday errands in the afternoon. You’ve worked hard this whole year to stay fit, healthy and manage your weight. Don’t allow stress to ruin your motivation to stay committed to your fitness goals.  Believe that you are stronger now and that you can mentally endure the challenges that may come your way this holiday season. Weight gain can also be a source of stress, but having a perfectionist attitude to achieve your normal healthy eating and exercise practices can magnify your issues. Accept that there will be some changes, that there will be days that you might crave some food gifts and holiday foods that you will have with your family. It’s okay because you can always apply healthy eating strategies like portion control, choosing only the foods worth the calories, and doing your best on regular days when you can be more in control of food. Try your best to keep a food journal to be more aware of your holiday eating habits and balance everything out right away, like exercising more and eating healthier the next day. Apply simple strategies when it comes to healthy eating at home. Start your day with a piece of toast and egg or yogurt with nuts and fruits. Holiday errands and household chores can keep you busy, so avoid hunger pangs that might happen during lunch or dinner by grabbing snacks that don’t require preparation fruits, nuts, boiled sweet potato, or boiled eggs. For lunch and dinner, always have vegetables, and the easiest way to have vegetables for lunch or dinner is to blanch, bake, boil or steam. You can always prepare a salad with roast chicken or left-over viands like stir-fried beef or seafood. Late-night gatherings and back-to-back parties can increase alcohol consumption, especially if you will be with friends you haven’t seen for a long time.  Aside from consuming extra calories from alcohol, sleep and quality might be affected. Then last night’s hangover can delay your important tasks for the next day like exercising, waking up early to prepare your healthy meals, and attending to your holiday errands like buying gifts and preparing the house for gatherings. Try your best to prioritize the most needed sleep this holiday season. Limit the consumption of alcohol to no more than two drinks per occasion. Give yourself a curfew when it comes to attending parties. Always stay hydrated. The holiday stress of all the problems you are having right now and thoughts of loved ones who died or can’t see this season can mentally and emotionally affect you. The best thing that you can do right now is to still stay positive despite what happened, count your blessings, and do your very best to be at your healthiest for your loved ones. Don’t dwell on things you don’t have that you often see on social media, such as new clothes, cool celebrations, expensive vacations. Focus on all the good things happening to you, like having a strong and loving family. Pray, reflect, meditate and always be grateful each day. Appreciate the best people you are with, the priceless moments you are experiencing, and knowing that you have so much love from within to give and so many things that you are still capable of doing in this world. At the same time, you are still alive and strong.  Email the author at [email protected] or follow her on Instagram @mitchfelipemendoza   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
A platform for those who need to be heard,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/392298/a-platform-for-those-who-need-to-be-heard/,"01:20 PM December 10, 2021","For Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc, Inquirer’s editor in chief who died in 2015, the Inquirer is “refuge of the afflicted, the oppressed, the voiceless.” This remains true today. And beyond providing refuge, the paper prides itself on continuing to give a voice and a platform to those who need to be heard, and in the process enriching the perspective of our readers. These are just some of the many groups we devote our space to for good reason. There are two sections in the Inquirer where you can read the thoughts of young writers—the Youngblood column in the Opinion section and ToBeYou in Lifestyle. ToBeYou, which has been around since the mid-’90s, has been the platform of generations of student correspondents, many of whom have gone on to conquer the world. Released on Saturdays, the ToBeYou section publishes stories written by teens (and sometimes even tweens) about the things that matter to them—family, school, friends, sports, music, literature, movies and TV, games, hobbies, politics and the desire to make the world a better place. It’s a section for the youth by the youth. During the pandemic, our young writers have chronicled their life in quarantine, writing about what they’ve done to help those in need, while also putting the spotlight on the people who inspire them. They are fearless and smart, passionate and driven, and they give us hope for this country’s future. (Know someone who might want to be a student correspondent? Ask them to email [email protected]) There is no room for homophobia or bigotry in the Inquirer. We love and support the LGBTQIA community, celebrating their wins, and providing them with a platform so they can talk about their continuing fight for equality. The Inquirer publishes stories about and by LGBTQIA folk not just on Pride Month, but all year round. (Have a story to contribute? Email [email protected])PWDs The Inquirer has also published pieces about and from persons with disabilities. We’ve come out with stories written by visually impaired women, a teenager who lost his hearing as a child, and people with disabilities visible or otherwise. (Have a story to contribute? Email [email protected])Home-based entrepreneurs Home cooks and bakers have seen their small businesses grow after being featured in Lifestyle’s weekly food section. The exposure they would otherwise not have had access to helped boost awareness. Our food vocabulary—and waistlines—have since expanded to include everything from sushi bakes to mountains of pastries. (Have a story to contribute? Email [email protected]) Lifestyle has a running list of fresh, talented and resourceful fashion designers who use their creations as a medium for their thoughts, obsessions and advocacies. Some of the creatives and their pieces who have appeared on Designers to Watch are Pamela Madlangbayan and her modern terno made of bubble wrap and the “Fragile” packing tape used to seal balikbayan boxes; Maryrose Anne Villena’s edgy Filipiniana leather biker jacket; and Sean Carlo Betco and his daring P*ta collection, which tackles the lack of protection for sex workers. Many of us were struggling (and trying our best!) with mental health issues even before the pandemic brought with it all sorts of feelings of loss, panic and helplessness. Through it all, Inquirer has been sort of companion or friend to those who have been struggling with depression, anxiety and mental health problems. In our archives are a trove of articles and essays about firsthand accounts of shrink visits and medications, tales from a suicide hotline responder, advice from mental health experts and advocates and stories of hope and healing. The Inquirer has always kept all its formidable senses focused on the emerging creative talent, particularly in areas such as music, cinema, literature and geekdom. We highlighted the works that deserved a chance. The Inquirer was one of the first to report on the phenomenon of Filipino komikeros, such as Budjette Tan and KajO Baldisimo’s “Trese,” Carlo Vergara’s “Zsazsa Zaturnnah,” Manix Abrera’s “Kikomachine” and Kevin Eric Raymundo’s “Tarantadong Kalbo.” Inquirer Super covered the yearly Komikon, then Komiket and now the Philippine International Comics Festival. We love our toys and the toymakers. Super also took a deep interest in the obsessions and the fandoms of our readers and evolved along with them, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe to K-Drama to the next streaming sensation. We love lolas and lolos here at Inquirer—and we give them plenty of space. There’s High Blood the column but there’s also Lifestyle’s S subsection—S as in seniors, which features the voices of Chit Roces-Santos and Gil Yuzon. One senior writer we definitely miss? The brilliant Gilda Cordero-Fernando. INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

And just like everyone, she figures out ways to go through those days. Magalona had such a day today, but thankfully, she was able to solve what was bothering her, as per her Instagram page. “When you’re dealing with a mental health condition, juggling different jobs, going on a self-healing journey and experiencing a spiritual awakening all at the same time — it can get pretty overwhelming,” she observed. “I understand that there will really be days when uncomfortable feelings such as anxiety, fear, shame, guilt and doubt naturally arise and there’s nothing else to do but to just hold space for them and let them come,” she advised. In instances such as those, the best thing to do, according to Magalona, is to “surrender to the present moment.”   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Maxene Magalona-Mananquil (@maxenemagalona)  “Do not resist. Allow the present moment to unfold before you as though you chose it,” she said. She feels that it is best to “close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.” “Breathe and remember that you are not your thoughts. You are your soul. You are your heart. You are your breath. Cry if you must but just keep breathing and hold yourself gently through the process. Focus on your breath, stay present and be here NOW,” she explained. Letting go of pain is also a solution, she implied, as she added: “Today, in this moment, I learned that the more we let go, the more we become free. Holding on to pain will only poison your soul.” “Hold on to hope. Hold on to peace. Hold on to happiness instead,” Magalona advised. Magalona also noted that today is the Feast of the Immaculate Concepcion, as she expressed gratitude for being held by Mary during her tearful meditation. She said she is recognizing that moment as one of “synchronicity”: “Because if this isn’t a synchronicity, then I don’t know what is.” JB RELATED STORIES: Maxene Magalona explains reason behind name of dad Francis M Maxene Magalona to cleanse, detoxify in quarantine as she returns to Manila from Bali   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Young entrepreneur shows way to do business in COVID era,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391969/young-entrepreneur-shows-way-to-do-business-in-covid-era/,"02:53 PM December 04, 2021"," MANILA, Philippines—Hair dyeing and food are hardly businesses that complement each other but entrepreneur Johan Joshua Principio is able to juggle those with his regular job as a communications consultant.  Principio is the owner of I Wanna Dye, which offers hair dyeing services, and Tofu Max, which specializes in tofu-based dishes. His ventures belong to two different industries as they were born out of different purposes. Principio said he won some sort of freedom when he entered college as this allowed him to dye his hair whatever color he fancied, giving in to his dream of getting a tinge on his locks. “I’ve always been a fan of funky hair colors. I wanted to try it so bad when I was so young and I just was told that it wasn’t for me, that I wasn’t allowed to do so,” he said in an interview with INQUIRER.net.  “But, when I entered college, I took the liberty of the environment. It was too embracing, It was loud. It enabled me to be who I am today,” he said. “When I entered college, there weren’t many restrictions, especially with clothing, hair color,” Principio said. “So, I took the chance. And then from then on, I started dyeing my hair with different colors. I went from blue, green, pink, and a lot more, and it was so enjoyable that I wanted to do it to others as well,” he said. He added that his friends asked him to dye their curls which went favorably, prompting him to consider it as a business.  In an unrelated business, Tofu Max, Principio said he ventured into eating more like a gourmand than a chef.  TAG MO SI J, LILIBRE KA NIYA TOFU SISIG!!! Posted by Tofu Max on Monday, October 25, 2021 However, the limitations brought by the COVID-19 pandemic led Principio to preparing a dish for himself. “I wasn’t really a fan of cooking. I’m more of an ‘eat’ person,” Principio said. “I enjoy eating but not so much with cooking, especially growing up when we were told, ‘you can’t cook,’ ‘you don’t know how to cook rice,’ and so on. That would discourage you, really,” he said. “But, when I got a chance, the pandemic happened, I had to cook for myself and discovered a lot. I realized that it’s just following instructions simply and then making it all about yourself already. So, you add whatever suits your taste buds,” Principio said. According to Principio, he got tired of consuming meat and he noticed he was gaining a few more pounds until he discovered the wonders that he could do with tofu. He introduced his dish to his friends which they enjoyed. From then on, Principio saw the potential of tofu as a business. “When I start seeing a potential in something, I nurture it,” he said. I Wanna Dye was not spared when COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns drove people out of jobs and led to the closure of businesses. Principio recounted that he had to take a pause and reassess the fate of his venture along the way. Fortunately, he saw light at the end of the health crisis tunnel. “When the pandemic or lockdown started in March [2020], we really had to take a pause and during those times, we were really able to reassess: Is there really a need for us still given that people weren’t really going out much?,” the entrepreneur said. “But then, along the way, we discovered that people were really stressed out. They wanted to look beautiful. They wanted to express themselves the way they can and that’s where the need for I Wanna Dye comes out,” he said. After pondering over whether I Wanna Dye should push through, Principio’s yearning for hair dyeing prevailed. But he struggled to find potential customers for his other venture, Tofu Max, since it was established amid the pandemic, because of the impact of lockdowns.  “I think the challenge with Tofu Max now, given that we’ve just launched it recently, so given that it’s during the pandemic, it’s quite obvious that there aren’t much people to sell your things to,” Principio said. “You really have to go the extra mile to introduce your product to people to let them know that you exist, and that’s quite a challenge for me,” he went on. In a digital world where almost everything is online, Principio maximizes the internet for his business , specifically I Wanna Dye, by using its social media pages to promote advocacies on mental health, equality, and even politics.  get a chance to WIN an all-expenses-paid PINK HAIR transformation from I WANNA DYE.

I Wanna Dye uses its social media platforms to let people know its opinions on political issues, too.

Principio called on new entrepreneurs and fellow business owners to recognize their privilege and use it to elevate their ventures. “You won’t be able to start a business without a capital,” Principio said. “So, for that, you have to be thankful already and use that wisely. I am a believer of hard work and you should be too. And you always, always, always have to recognize your privilege and use that as a tool to be able to nurture your business and take your business to greater heights,” he said. “Starting up a business is not an overnight success. Although it all starts with a dream, you still have to ground yourself in reality. So, that’s how you plan things out,” Principio added. For hair dyeing, I Wanna Dye offers home services for as low as P2,000 and a maximum of P6,000. Clients will be notified of any additional costs beyond the price range. Principio said that he wanted I Wanna Dye to be accessible and affordable with reasonable, and transparent prices. On his other venture, for a less-guilt healthier alternative to meat, a good-for-sharing tofu-based dish could be availed of for as low as P109 at Tofu Max. Among the varieties of the outlet’s Sarap ng Pinoy tofu-based dishes are adobo, Bicol express, and their best-selling sisig.

Perhaps it’s because, as the years pass, with life’s ups and downs, I have a better understanding of them and the choices they made along the way,” she explained. While she acknowledged that her mom and dad “weren’t perfect people” and neither is she, she marveled at “how perfectly it all came together, the joy and sorrow, the pain and pleasure and all that love that held it together.” “My mother and father were perfectly chosen by God to help me in my evolution. What a gift,” she realized. “Until then, I will live life knowing that you’re both near, watching over me, supporting me along the way.

In a collage of photos and videos, Pring recalled how her November was — a month replete with memories she shared on her Instagram page yesterday, Nov. 1. “A November [photo dump] of sorts because it was an action-packed month filled with family adventure, back-to-work magic, and joyful life-giving moments in between,” she said. First on her list was her “road trip” to Batangas, the family’s first official trip. “What was supposed to be a [two-hour] drive turned out to be a little over [four] hours because of breastfeeding breaks in between,” she shared. She also recounted hosting projects connected with her social and spiritual advocacies. “I had several events where I hosted, spoke at, and guested in – including this one with @amen_ph, where I got to speak about mental health and the story of God’s saving grace in my life. And, yes, they named a mask after me,” she said.

"Ben&Ben, Zild, and Juan Karlos did their own stunts for the ‘Lunod’ MV",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/392009/benben-zild-and-juan-karlos-did-their-own-stunts-for-the-lunod-mv/,"03:42 PM November 29, 2021","Judging from the names attached to it alone—Ben&Ben, Zild, and Juan Karlos—“Lunod” already looks like a musical feat. But according to the artists, the process for the track and its visuals was a big deal in itself. “Na-push kami sa limits (We were pushed to the limits),” says Ben&Ben lead vocalist Paolo Benjamin during a virtual press con, as he talked about filming “Lunod’s” visuals. Released today, Nov. 26, “Lunod’s” music video is the brainchild of filmmaker Jerrold Tarog, who the nine-member band previously worked with on the “Goyo” soundtrack’s “Susi” MV. They dropped him a line on Messenger, and the result was this: darkly lit, moody scenes filmed underground in San Juan’s El Deposito water reservoir, a national heritage site that was the location of the Battle of San Juan del Monte in 1896. The fact seemed fitting, when “Lunod’s” lyrics sang about inner battles and mental health. The artists had their fair share of physical challenges filming the visuals, too, something that they say had pushed them outside of their comfort zones.   A post shared by Ben&Ben (@benandbenmusic)  In several shots, members of Ben&Ben, along with collaborators Zild and Juan Karlos, are submerged in water with flowers in their eyes—which they all did by themselves. “Nakalunok ako ng tubig, pero worth it naman,” Zild laughs after recalling the moment. (I accidentally swallowed water, but it was worth it.) “Hindi mo alam kung kailan ’yung exact time na bubuhos ’yung tubig. Para siyang E.K. (Enchanted Kingdom), hindi mo alam kung kailan mahuhulog ’yung rollercoaster,” adds drummer Jam Villanueva. (We didn’t know when the water would fall on us. It was just like [a ride in] Enchanted Kingdom—you wouldn’t know when the roller coaster would drop.) Aside from their larger-than-life experience filming the MV, the track’s creation was already an epic tale to begin with. For Zild, the creative process felt like an eye-opening moment, after seeing other people make their magic. “Kung ano ’yung nakikita n’yo sa live performance, ganon sila lahat sa studio,” Zild says. “Ang saya, parang ‘Avengers.’ Biglang iba-iba ’yung character ng mga tao doon.” (They act similarly, whether it’s in the studio or in live performances. It was fun, just like “Avengers.” Suddenly, there were all sorts of characters in the room.) Well, you can see the end product for yourself. Watch the “Lunod” MV below.

Fully vaccinated? How to effectively embrace the concept of hybrid fitness,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391999/fully-vaccinated-how-to-effectively-embrace-the-concept-of-hybrid-fitness/,"01:53 PM November 29, 2021","COVID-19 changed the health and fitness industry. Fitness will never be the same again. For almost the past two years, we’ve been forced to resort to online sessions in all aspects of our daily tasks- work, school, socials, financial tasks, religion, food, and fitness. Most people are fully vaccinated, so some fitness facilities are reopening, along with the resumption of recreational activities. Online fitness sessions will still stay as most people are so used to doing home workouts. Our current situation calls for a more flexible approach: the hybrid fitness model. It includes both online and in-person fitness training. How can hybrid fitness work for you? Here are some ideas on how to start your hybrid workout sessions. Working out at home has become a habit for you because of convenience, accessibility, practicality, and effectiveness. We are still unsure of what will happen in the near future, so it’s best to stick to a home workout that you truly enjoy for 20 to 60 minutes at least twice a week. It can be your regular online live Zoom classes, on-demand fitness workout, and YouTube dance routines. You can then explore other workout options available outside in addition to your basic lifestyle routines. Combine your home strength and core sessions with outdoor cardio training.  Aside from the physical benefits of outdoor training, it can positively affect mental health by improving your stress level and mood. Explore outdoor activities once again like hiking, brisk walking, running, cycling, or circuit training with a coach while being aware of the basic COVID-19 safety protocols like wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, and hand washing.  I started with occasional outdoor cycling early this year, which is relaxing and very pleasant to the senses. Two months ago, I started to run outdoors again with my husband every Sunday morning. We are now incorporating a few minutes of bodyweight exercises and plyometric training right after the run session. Returning to outdoor fitness habits always gives me that excitement to reminisce about my past exercise training. At the same time, it makes me hopeful about new fitness options that will be available soon. Choose a gym that practices strict and safe standards. Visit the gym during non-peak hours. Wear an exercise mask and bring your towel. You can still workout with a personal trainer but avoid physical contact while training. Frequently sanitize your hands and practice social distancing inside the gym. Make it a habit to sanitize exercise equipment that you use after every use. Three weeks ago, we stayed at Shangri-la Manila at The Fort for a couple of nights, our very first staycation after almost two years, to celebrate my husband’s birthday. We were able to use the hotel’s fitness gym, Kerry Sports Manila. It was such a great experience to workout in a big gym once again. Luckily, I was able to use the huge group fitness studio alone while teaching some of my Zoom workout classes. I also used the treadmill for a quick run and observed how they strategically positioned the treadmills, with hand sanitizers in between the machines. Two weeks ago, I joined a couple of classes at Rise Nation (an intense 30-minute full-body workout using a Versa Climber), one of the latest boutique studios that opened only months before the pandemic. It was my first time to join a live class after almost 20 months. It felt terrific to exercise again with other people, moving all-out to the beat of the music with a pumped instructor. We were wearing masks, and social distancing was observed during the class. The experience made me more excited to teach a live indoor cycling class once again at Electric Studio, which I believe is happening soon. Most studios will offer in-studio classes and retain the online business model to respond to clients’ needs. Having more workout options (in-person and online) plays a significant role in one’s exercise sustainability. If you join a class inside a boutique fitness studio, you need to wear an exercise mask, bring your ID and vaccination card, towel, hand sanitizer, and water bottle. Don’t stay too long inside the studio for chats and group photos. Do not exert too much effort, especially if you are not used to wearing a mask. It is essential to consult with your medical doctor first if you intend to join an intense workout, especially if you have health issues. Hybrid fitness training can be done even while you are away from home. I know some people who will travel this December and are still persistent in exercising even while on vacation. You can continue your fitness routines and still burn your target calories even while away by continuing your online workout sessions, doing outdoor activities like hiking, and trying exercise studios that practice safe workout protocols. Invest in a fitness tracker so you can still monitor your physical activity, calorie burn, and intensity. Hybrid fitness can also open new opportunities for a fitness coach like me.  I see myself traveling again, exploring different places, but at the same time working by attending to my online one-on-one personal training and group fitness clients while opening the possibility of offering in-person classes at the same time.

"‘Make unconscious addictions part of your awareness,’ Maxene Magalona advises",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391979/make-unconscious-addictions-part-of-your-awareness-maxene-magalona-advises/,"09:42 PM November 28, 2021","Everybody has a dark side, and actress and yoga teacher Maxene Magalona believes everyone should face that side head on. Magalona thinks that the earlier one does this, the better, as per her Instagram page yesterday, Nov. 27. “Have you ever heard of shadow work? This is the practice of getting in touch with the parts of yourself that you’ve repressed — or what many might refer to as their ‘dark side.’ It involves diving into the unconscious material that shapes our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors,” she said. People have the tendency to deny the existence of this dark side, something that Magalona has a solution for. “The goal is to make those unconscious addictions, such as the pain of a traumatic event, part of your conscious awareness so that you can work on them. This is how we can come face to face with the parts of ourselves that we have unconsciously rejected just because we do not like them. They make us feel uncomfortable which is why we just tend to deny them,” she explained. But living in denial, for Magalona, is “unhealthy and it is just impossible to run away from yourself.”   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Maxene Magalona-Mananquil (@maxenemagalona)  She thus suggests: “You have to face your inner darkness and learn how to embrace it so that it can be integrated into your entire being.” “We are all made of both light and dark, good and bad, pretty and ugly, cute and annoying. Face it. Embrace it. This is how you become whole,” she added. “If you can accept and integrate your own darkness, then who can ever use it against you? No one. This becomes your power. And this is how you take your power back. THIS is the real kind of self-care.” Magalona, aside from teaching yoga and promoting mental health awareness, is part of the cast of the ABS-CBN series “Viral Scandal” alongside Charlie Dizon, Dimples Romana and Jake Cuenca.

"Teens, technology and the social media problem",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391750/teens-technology-and-the-social-media-problem/,"10:20 PM November 23, 2021","Is one’s worth really defined by numbers? Is it followers, likes or what you see on a weighing scale or report card that dictates the course of your existence? In this digital age, it’s so easy to get caught up in the dizzying whirlwind of trends and tweets that make up social media. Indeed, the near-crushing load of today’s news, the constant pressure to live up to societal expectations, and feelings of inadequacy of one’s life or appearance get quite hard to carry at times for most, and for teenagers like myself, it’s no different. Today, statistics from recent surveys by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan American think tank based in Washington, DC, state that nearly 90 percent of teens have at least one active social media profile. According to an article by Digital Marketing Philippines, 65 percent of the 40 million active social media users worldwide are, in fact, teenagers and young adults. “For teenagers, the combined weight of vulnerability, the need for validation and a desire to compare themselves with peers forms a perfect storm of self-doubt,” says Dr. Donna Wick, a clinical psychologist and the founder of Mind-to-Mind Parenting. Though there’s no denying that social media apps like Facebook and Instagram provide effective means of activism, communication, entertainment and self-expression, it’s important to remember that these platforms generally operate without moral codes whatsoever, making bullying and harassment rampant, as well as predatory behavior and the spread of false information. There are an estimated 500,000 online predators active each day, lurking even on apps geared toward children. Teens between the ages of 12 and 15 are especially susceptible to be groomed or manipulated by adults they meet online, and an estimated 89 percent of sexual advances directed at children occur in internet chat rooms or social media websites. Predators looking to groom children online often pretend to be their age, building an identity on fake profile pictures and pretending to share similar interests. Once a relationship between the adult and the victim is established, the circumstances often steer toward forcing the minor to send explicit photos of themselves, the exchange of pornographic material and blackmail. Aside from its immediate dangers, social media has also been proven to affect one’s mental health. A study out of the University of Pittsburgh found a correlation between time spent scrolling through social media platforms and negative body image feedback. People who had spent more time online had 2.2 times the risk of reporting eating disorders and body image concerns compared to their peers who spent less time on social media. As people living in the 21st century, to function without the internet is unfeasible. But how can we make it a safer place for children and adults alike? First of all, be kind. It may seem like a childish, tepid sentiment, but kindness in itself repels hate, and in a world where there’s so much of it, it’s all we need. Leave a nice comment instead of a mean one, and share your opinions instead of forcing them on others. Next, protect your online data. Shield information with passwords to avoid scams, safeguard your devices from viruses and spyware and keep what you want to keep private, private. Stand up for yourself, and don’t be afraid to click the block button if someone is making you uncomfortable. Encourage authenticity, but don’t put down people who create. Lastly, remember that like our gadgets that need to be recharged, it’s alright to take some time to log off, shut down, rest and rejuvenate. In a society obsessed with ideals of unrealistic productivity and the “grind,” don’t forget that the burnout starts when fuel isn’t added to the fire. Oftentimes, we find ourselves struggling to keep up with the ever-changing standards and narratives of what the internet defines as the “perfect life.” To many, it’s one involving flawless looks, extravagant vacations and straight As. But is one’s worth really defined by numbers? Is it followers, likes or what you see on a weighing scale or report card that dictates the course of your existence? Though it may not be the picture-perfect Instagram-worthy series of snaps, I find that the best life is the one worth living, and how you live it is up to you. —CONTRIBUTED INQ The author is a Grade 8 student of Homeschool Global Philippines.

‘Viral Scandal’ star Charlie Dizon urges everyone to be careful when using social media,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391145/viral-scandal-star-charlie-dizon-urges-everyone-to-be-careful-when-using-social-media/,"08:57 PM November 11, 2021","Actress Charlie Dizon considers her TV series, “Viral Scandal,” an eye-opener for social media users and netizens. Aside from being timely, the series is socially relevant, Dizon said during a press conference for the series today, Nov. 11. She thinks it is important for people to be nice and compassionate when they give their opinions online, because aside from the persons subject of viral posts, the entire online environment is affected. Dizon also wishes for people to be conscious about the things they download and share from the web. “Mas maging maingat sa pag-download sa social media and other online platforms and sa pagpapakalat ng viral photos, videos and news kasi ang hirap ngayon. Hindi na tayo nakakapagkita-kita in person dahil nga may pandemya pa and ‘yun lang ang nababalitaan natin,” she said, believing that if we see all the negative on social media it will affect our mental health. (Be extra careful about what you download from social media and other online platforms, as well as with sharing viral photos, videos and news, because it is difficult these days. We don’t see each other anymore because of the on-going pandemic, and [what we see online] are the only things we hear about.) In the series, Dizon plays the role of Rica, who is finishing her internship in an architectural firm and about to take the board exam when she gets involved in a viral video. She lauds her character’s determination to ward off negative criticisms. “Everyday ay lumalaban si Rica. Lahat ng binabato sa kanya ay nilalabanan niya talaga. Sana makuha nila ‘yung tapang ni Rica during ‘yung journey na ‘yon,” she said. (Everyday, Rica fights. She fights against everything thrown against her. I hope people are moved by Rica’s bravery during that journey.) When asked about the similarities and differences of Rica’s character compared to her own personality, Dizon said Rica’s character is very complex. “Masyado siyang maraming pinagdadaanan. Siguro ‘yun ‘yung hindi pa ako maka-relate talaga kasi hindi naman ganoon ‘yung pinagdadaanan ko as Charlie,” she said. (She is going through so much. Maybe that’s one thing that I can’t relate with yet, because that’s not what I go through being Charlie.) What she can relate with, though, is Rica’s courage. “Siguro ang pinakanakaka-relate ako talaga is ‘yung tapang niya. Hindi siya patatalo sa lahat ng ibinabato sa kanya,” she said. (Maybe what I can relate with the most is her courage. She won’t allow herself to be beaten by anything hurled against her.) “Viral Scandal” also stars Dimples Romana, Jake Cuenca and Maxene Magalona, among others, and can be viewed via the Kapamilya Channel, TV5, A2Z, Kapamilya Online Live, iWantTFC and TFC IPTV starting Nov. 15.

Garcia expressed apprehension for her daughter as can be seen in her Instagram post yesterday, November 8, in which she shared three photos of Mori’s online class. “Enrolling Mori in the Beginning Readers Program is a decision that I do not regret. I’d have to admit that at first, I was apprehensive about her attending a class online. I was afraid that she will only get anxious and frustrated with her progress and find it difficult to understand her teacher in an online setting but I was wrong,” she said in her post. She lauded Teacher Taj and called her a “gem.” “We have a Viber Group and every time I ask her assistance with something that Mori is struggling with, she’d equip me with tools I can download for free. This includes links and she even takes videos to show me how I can be of help in Mori’s progress towards spelling, reading and writing. Ang empowering mga Inay (This is so empowering, mothers),” she said. For Garcia, “regular schooling has its perks (I get to have alone time which is a must for my mental health), (but) Homeschooling with Cascades brings me great joy as well.” With the online class, Garcia and her daughter’s bond became stronger. “I get to know her strengths and weaknesses firsthand so I know which area we need to focus on more and so on,” she said, lauding her teacher Taj in the process. “I honor you! Thank you for being intentional and patient with Mori and the rest of her classmates. We’ll see you next Monday!” she said.  /ra RELATED STORIES: Alwyn Uytingco hints at getting back together with Jennica Garcia Jennica Garcia dismisses rumors she reconciled with Alwyn Uytingco Alwyn Uytingco asks Jennica Garcia for forgiveness, dismisses other’s opinions  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

Pring spoke about this in her Instagram page last Friday, Nov. 5, where she shared a short video with a message which said, “When God writes your love story, it’ll be better than anything you could’ve ever imagined.”   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Joyce Pring-Triviño (@joycepring)  Pring shared that she is very close to her dad, and that even as a kid, she had so many conversations with him “about faith, relationships, politics, philosophy, and even mental health.” The TV host is referring to her stepdad, stepdad, Chandro Uttamchandani who helped raise her, after her biological father was assassinated when she was only over a year old. He was the policeman Joe Pring whose life was made into a series of films starring Philip Salvador. It is Uttamchandani therefore who has given her the fatherly guidance she needed while growing up, so much so that she actually considers him her father, more than a stepfather. “He was an intentional learner, and also a great communicator, so we would spend many hours just talking about everything under the sun (I guess he’s one of the biggest influences to my hosting career).” She remembered how her dad instructed her to already start praying for her would-be-husband even when she was just ten years old then. She found it “weird” and “funny” because she was so young and of course didn’t have any plans of marrying. But her father told her, “God will prepare him in time for when you meet each other.” “This idea — that God will mold, prepare, and shape the person who was to be my husband one day, even while I had no idea who he was — stuck with me. So I started and continued praying for him… until I finally got married to him,” she said. Pring and Juancho Triviño exchanged I do’s on Feb. 9, 2020, in a garden wedding at the Sofitel.

"Novartis, partners raise awareness on AxSpA, a debilitating spine and joint disease",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/390621/novartis-partners-raise-awareness-on-axspa-a-debilitating-spine-and-joint-disease/,"01:01 PM November 03, 2021","As part of the Bone and Joint Week celebration this October, Novartis announced the renewal of its partnership with Axial Spondyloarthritis Association of the Philippines (ASAPh) and Philippine Rheumatology Association (PRA) to raise awareness on Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA) early diagnosis and treatment. AxSpA is an umbrella term that can include non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA), radiographic axSpA known as Ankylosing Spondylitis, as well as various other kinds of spondyloarthritis conditions.(1) This October, Bone and Joint Week is celebrated to raise awareness on disorders such as arthritis, back pain, trauma, pediatric conditions, osteoporosis and including axSpA. Activities included in this awareness campaign are designed to educate patients, families and the general public about the importance of early diagnosis, prevention, disease management and treatment. Early Axial Spondyloarthritis diagnosis leads to more meaningful, productive life Nr-axSpA patients may not have any inflammation visible on x-ray or MRI despite symptoms of back pain. Some may never go on to develop visible inflammation on MRI. This can lead to delay in diagnosis. Diagnosis delay refers to the interval between the appearance of symptoms of axSpA and the diagnosis, which is usually made by a rheumatologist but may be made by another health care provider. Globally, the delay in diagnosis averages about seven years. (2) Early consultation is key to addressing axSpA. Some of the early signs and symptoms of axSpA include frequent back pains caused by inflammation in the spine, but can also affect other joints, tendons and ligaments, persistence of pain lasting for months as opposed to pain coming on in short attacks, weight loss, fatigue or tiredness, feeling feverish and night sweats.(3) “Raising awareness to this underserved group of patients who have non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis , continuing advances in education among clinicians and empowering the patients themselves, we have the chance to prevent disability,” explained Dr. Evan Glenn Vista, FPCP, FPRA, Rheumatologist. “By intervening early and holistically, these individuals would be able to lead a meaningful life, integrate and contribute to our society without the burden of the disease during their most productive years.” The International Map of Axial Spondyloarthritis (IMAS) survey, the largest global case study, has recently found that many patients experience difficulties in daily living, career choices, and even their mental health if the diagnosis and treatment are delayed. (4) The good news is that AxSpA is treatable and there are several novel treatments available. Proper diagnosis and treatment are crucial for better patient outcomes. “All of us at ASAPh, as well as our families, NGOs, the Philippine Rheumatology Association, and Novartis Philippines, believe that we can achieve our shared purpose, which is to give Filipino AS patients a pain-free life,” said Mr. Clark Ferrer, President, Axial Spondyloarthritis Association of the Philippines. “The COVID-19 pandemic affected the diagnosis and treatment of our patients. Through this renewed partnership with Novartis, we are hopeful that our patients will have better access to information on the disease and novel treatments for this condition.  With our 200-strong rheumatologist members and partners, we at the Philippine Rheumatology Association are one with your mission of providing better health outcomes to our AS patients,” shared Dr. Juan Javier Lichauco, President, Philippine Rheumatology Association. “Over the years, we have formed a strong relationship with ASAPh and PRA. Having these partnerships allows us to offer healthcare services to those who need them most. We at Novartis support your goal of improving the quality of life of AS patients. Research and development efforts are designed to provide patients with novel medicines and treatments that will let them live pain-free. As partners, we look forward to this strengthened collaboration as well as to providing the support our patients need,” emphasized Jugo Tsumura, President and Managing Director, Novartis. Multi-stakeholder partnerships between the Axial Spondyloarthritis Association of the PH (ASAPh), Philippine Rheumatology Association (PRA) and Novartis seek to guide patients and raise awareness about AS. A recent ASAPh campaign, dubbed as “Got UR Back”, is an example of an awareness initiative that encourages patients to ‘speak their truth’ about the pain and real-life complications brought about by their axSpA condition. From the importance of learning about this disease, to early diagnosis, to better treatment access to patients here in the Philippines, the campaign promises that stakeholders ‘got patients’ backs’ in that they listen to and plan on acting on the problems that the patients themselves voice out. In connection to this campaign, Filipinos living with axSpA are invited to share their personal experiences with the debilitating disease by participating in the IMAS online patient experience survey. It is a worldwide anonymous survey to give AS patients a chance to be heard. For more information, visit the ASAPh Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/asaph.org) to learn more about this campaign for AS patients and take the IMAS survey.

Caring for employees always a top priority for Globe,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/390294/caring-for-employees-always-a-top-priority-for-globe/,"05:15 PM October 27, 2021"," Employees are a company’s backbone. For Globe, extending care to customers and providing better connectivity experience especially amidst challenging times happen because of their hard work. Therefore, the company’s relentless dedication in treating people right to create a Globe of good is evidenced by initiatives to ensure the overall well-being of its workforce. “Doing our part in helping the nation rise above this pandemic is not simply about what we do externally for our customers and the community, but also what we do internally to care for our employees,” said Ato Jiao, Globe Chief Human Resource Officer. Last year, Globe promptly ensured all-around employee assistance through a holistic COVID-19 support package.  It boosted digitalization efforts to limit in-person contact and exposure, and allow employees to remain agile and efficient despite the logistical constraints. Globe particularly kept an eye on frontline workers providing essential service on-site. They were provided with safe lodging, meals, personal protective equipment (PPEs), vitamins, transportation, hazard pay, and insurance to help alleviate anxiety. Focusing on employees’ health and wellbeing, the company enhanced its existing medical insurance coverage, even going as far as fully shouldering medical expenses of those infected by the virus. Konsulta MD, AC Health, and Maxicare provided a hotline that employees and their dependents can consult with for urgent health concerns anytime, anywhere. A partnership was also forged with MindNation and HopeChat to care for employees’ mental health through virtual psychologists to help alleviate isolation and anxiety during these pressing times.  To maintain active employee engagement, Globe adopted a multi-faceted strategy focusing on the happiness, well-being, and continued growth of each employee despite challenges and limitations of an evolving work environment. Employee engagement sessions went virtual with learning and fitness sessions, talk shows, fun and educational webinars, and podcasts. Globe held 16 wellness webinars, and released 53 posts during Wellness Wednesdays, an initiative where Ka-Globe can talk about wellness in an online community.  Various chatbots were also developed to help ease employees into the new working style. Digital Usher for Disasters and Emergencies or DUDE is a chatbot which serves as daily health check-in for employees and enables COVID-19 support as well as access to mental health partners. Wanda was also developed as a recognition chatbot to enable employees to send special e-cards to one another, enabling them to nurture Globe’s culture of recognition even while working apart.   Leaders kept in touch and maintained regular interactions through virtual town hall meetings led by President and Chief Executive Officer, Ernest Cu. More than being kept abreast of key developments and updates on the business and the organization as a whole, these sessions were great opportunities for employees to directly ask questions and air concerns to the leadership team. While the Philippines is still battling the virus, Globe continues to listen to its employees and provide the necessary assistance to keep them safe, secure, and productive. Globe strongly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly UN SDG No. 3 on providing good health and well-being. Globe is committed to upholding the United Nations Global Compact principles and contributing to 10 UN SDGs. To know more about Globe, visit www.globe.com.ph.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

It is something that Magalona is so proud of and grateful for, as can be seen in her Instagram page yesterday, Oct. 17. While her acting projects may not come too frequently, Magalona keeps the faith that she will always be blessed with work that aligns with her values. She believes the show “couldn’t have come at a more perfect time” in her life. “To be part of a project that strongly advocates for mental health and shows the importance of learning how to deal with trauma is truly a dream come true for me,” she said.   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Maxene Magalona-Mananquil (@maxenemagalona)  “Being a mental health patient/advocate myself, I know how difficult it is to live with inner struggles so to be given an opportunity to be part of a project that aims to help and give hope to others who are experiencing the same mental health issues is truly a blessing.” Magalona plays Audrey Ramones. She expressed her excitement to be performing “alongside some of the best actors, kindest human beings and sweetest souls.” “This is my new family and I thank God everyday for allowing our paths to cross in this lifetime,” she added. “I love each and every one of you and I’m so proud to be creating art, feeling love and healing hearts together with you.” “Viral Scandal” marks the return of Magalona to acting after a few years.

Rica Peralejo zooms in on mirror neurons and their connection with trauma,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/389906/rica-peralejo-zooms-in-on-mirror-neurons-and-their-connection-with-trauma/,"04:21 PM October 18, 2021","Actress-vlogger Rica Peralejo shared with fans some knowledge about theories on mirror neurons which supposedly can explain the behavior of a person. Peralejo quoted Bessel van der Kolk who wrote “The Body Keeps the Score.” The doctor-author “has spent his professional life studying how children and adults adapt to traumatic experiences,” as per his official website. Peralejo shared that “mirror neurons explained many previously unexplainable aspects of the mind, such as empathy, imitation, synchrony, and even the development of language,” as seen on her Instagram page yesterday, Oct. 17. She can also be seen posing before mirrors in a series of photos in the post. Images were taken by Jay Jay Lucas and Chestknots at Balara Content Studio.   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Rica Peralejo-Bonifacio (@ricaperalejo)  “‘Neural WiFi’ —we pick up not only another person’s movement but her emotional state and intentions as well. When people are in sync with each other, they tend to stand or sit in similar ways, and their voices take on the same rhythms,” she added. But this is not always the case as “mirror neurons also make us vulnerable to others’ negativity, so that we respond to their anger with fury or are dragged down by their depression.” “I’ll have more to say about mirror neurons later in this book, because trauma almost invariably involves not being seen, not being mirrored, and not being taken into account,” she said, noting that “treatment needs to reactivate the capacity to safely mirror, and be mirrored, by others, but also to resist being hijacked by others’ negative emotions.” Peralejo explained that that these concepts are all connected to “how stories of others are helpful in our healing process,” which she said she will discuss further in an upcoming vlog.

Rica Peralejo on sibling relationships: ‘A belonging like no other’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/389704/rica-peralejo-on-sibling-relationships-a-belonging-like-no-other/,"08:16 PM October 12, 2021","Actress-vlogger Rica Peralejo misses her own siblings now living in the United States. She credits them for having been used by God to “mightily [minister] healing” to her from her mental health battles. She thus hopes that her own children would have the same loving sibling relationship. She spoke about people’s relationships with siblings on her Instagram page today, Oct. 12, sharing why siblings can be beneficial to one’s growth and development. She also showed a photo of her children, Manu and Philip, while sleeping. “[No] one in the world will ever understand the pains and joys of being under your parents except your brother or sister. I think primarily, that is the best about having a sibling,” she explained. “As a parent, I know my shortcomings and sometimes I can only pray that when the day comes that pain registers in their hearts because of things we’ve said, not said, done, not done, they will be there for each other to say with a knowing look, ‘Me, too.’”   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Rica Peralejo-Bonifacio (@ricaperalejo)  She thinks having a sibling is like having a best friend who will be at your side through thick and thin. “There is a belonging like no other in a sibling, especially when they have taken good care of that relationship,” Peralejo said. “Another thing I have [realized] in life is that to have a sibling is to have an automatic kakampi (ally) in life. I know everyone can be wrong about a lot of things, but you always need that one person who will stick by your side no matter what. I fervently pray this will be Manu to Philip and Philip to Manu.” She believes that “siblings can have this relationship with each other because they are simply related but not obliged to be each other’s authority” or any other type of influence. “The freedom from any rules of engagement makes it a very relaxing, unpretentious, freeing relationship. It’s one where you can just be without the fear of being cut-off,” she explained, while also recognizing that there will still be siblings who may need to cut off their own siblings, and siblings who might be cruel to their own siblings. As for those who do not have any sibling, Peralejo offers them a prayer to find friends with whom they can have sibling-like relationships.

Tales from a suicide hotline responder,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/389199/tales-from-a-suicide-hotline-responder/,"07:51 PM October 03, 2021","‘Sabi niya, ‘Hindi na, ma’am, wala nang saysay yung buhay ko, tatalon na ako.’ I told him, ‘The mere fact na tumawag ka sa Hopeline means gusto mo pang mabuhay’’ Fashion designer Jeannie Goulbourn lost her beloved daughter Natasha to suicide in 2002. Since then, she has devoted her life to mental health awareness and suicide prevention in the Philippines, putting up the Natasha Goulbourn Foundation, which is now known as NGF Mindstrong. In 2012, the foundation was launching its 24/7 emotional crisis and suicide prevention hotline. Over a thousand people applied to become part of the first batch of responders. Milagros Rollinas was one of them. Rollinas, who has a degree in social work, had spent nine years in child protection. Wanting to explore other aspects of being a social worker, she thought about trying to be a crisis responder. She succeeded, becoming one of the first 15 responders of Hopeline. Nine years later, Rollinas is Hopeline’s program head. But she still can’t forget the calls from her first day as a responder. “One of my first callers was a battered wife. She was suicidal. She was mentally drained and she wanted to get out of the relationship.” Before responders are allowed to answer calls at Hopeline, they go through an intensive training process. “It’s about mental health, depression, suicide, crisis response, counseling, crisis intervention, self-care,” says Rollinas. And when she says the training is intensive, she really means it. They go through simulation activities and mock calls, learning counseling techniques and the proper ways to respond, before they go through two weeks of on-the-job training. “You’ll be beside team leaders or senior responders who will coach you through the process.” Training is crucial, Rollinas says, because “you have to be confident when you respond to a call.” Self-discovery is important, too. Responders are taught to deal with their own baggage—they have to resolve their own issues first. Rollinas says, “Kailangan wala kang bagahe kasi there will come a time, especially when you’re tired and there are a lot of calls, na talagang mati-trigger ka.” A responder’s shift usually lasts eight hours. But when there’s a deluge of calls, sometimes they end up extending up to 10 or 12 hours. Some calls are short, Rollinas says. “Sometimes people just call to inquire or to vent. Those calls would last from 10 to 15 minutes.” Then there are what they refer to as moderate calls—people who are struggling, who may have suicidal thoughts, but not enough to be considered high-risk. It’s the high-risk calls that usually last the longest and are the most challenging to handle. Rollinas remembers receiving a call from a man who was around 80 years old. He was suicidal and he already had a gun in his hand. “Magsu-suicide siya because he was lonely. His kids were all abroad and they seldom called para mangumusta.”Rollinas spent over an hour with the man on the phone, encouraging him to recall his happy moments, to remember what it was like in the early days of his courtship with his wife. Eventually, she convinced him to put the gun away. “It was important that I establish his safety,” Rollinas says. By the time the call ended, the man was cheerful and was making jokes. He told her he was feeling better. In the past, each responder could expect to receive 8 to 10 calls each shift. But the pandemic has multiplied these numbers. “Nag-peak kami talaga. Nag-300-percent increase in calls. Ang dami kasing nagpa-panic, natatakot.” They get calls from people who lost their jobs, who are struggling with blended learning, who are having difficulty with adjusting to being confined at home. Sometimes, in a day, a responder would get three to four high-risk calls. So by the end of the shift, they would be exhausted. “Talagang drained ka. Very tiring siya psychologically,” Rollinas says. The people of NGF Mindstrong make sure they care for their Hopeline responders. They have psychologists and psychiatrists who lead debriefing sessions, whether individually or in groups. They also have learning sessions. “The difficult cases are discussed, anong strategies ’yung gagawin, the proper terminology. Your choice of words is so important because a single word can be someone’s trigger factor. Minsan mumurahin ka na n’un,” says Rollinas. They have a buddy system in place, too. And this system was crucial on a day Rollinas received a call from a man who said he was at an LRT station ready to jump in front of the next oncoming train. “When you’re a crisis responder, you have to use your senses. You have to listen not just to the caller but their surroundings. ’Pag mahangin, ibig sabihin baka nasa roof deck,” Rollinas says. When she asked the man where he was, he said he was at the platform at the Doroteo Jose station. He had a fight with his wife and he wanted to end his life. “Tatalon na ako, ma’am, ’pag may dumaan na tren,” he told Rollinas. So while Rollinas was talking to him, she was instructing another crisis responder—her buddy—to contact officials at that LRT station to tell them what was going on. Rollinas convinced the man to move away from the platform, telling him she couldn’t hear him well. “Sabi niya, ‘Hindi na, ma’am, wala nang saysay yung buhay ko, tatalon na ako. I told him, ‘The mere fact na tumawag ka sa Hopeline means gusto mo pang mabuhay.’” She kept him on the phone, letting him talk, cry, shout. “Naglabas siya ng sama ng loob niya.” The man calmed down eventually and Rollinas spoke to a guard at that LRT station to keep an eye on him and allow him to stay there for a bit while he composed himself. Some calls can really be draining, Rollinas says. “Minsan nakikipag-battle ka. You have be alert. You have to be three, five steps ahead.” We may never know the exact number of lives Hopeline has saved, but we know it will be saving more. Hopeline callers’ ages range from 10 to 95. Kids often call because they’re affected by seeing their parents fighting. Sometimes, parents would use the redial button to find out who their kids have been calling. One time, a Hopeline responder received a call from a 7-year-old kid who was alone at home and needed help with his homework. With Hopeline’s new system, Hopeline responders are able to stay safe and work from home, reporting to the office only once a week. “Naka-Cloud na kaming lahat,” says Rollinas. “The responders use group chats to communicate and ask help from one another.” Hopeline has 20 responders now—a mix of social workers, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, teachers—but Rollinas says with the increase in the number of callers, they really need more people, thus the need for funding. “Getting support is really a challenge,” she says. “We really look for funding to support the operations. It’s a free service but, of course, we have operational costs.” Nine years since she started, Rollinas remains passionate about what she does at NGF Mindstrong and Hopeline. “It’s really fulfilling, knowing that you’re helping other people. People tell you, ‘Thank you for saving my life,’ ‘Thank you for giving me another chance.’” For her, being a crisis responder isn’t just a job, it’s a mission. And right now, part of that mission is making sure Hopeline keeps going, by finding donors who are willing to help—both companies and individuals. Goulbourn said, “We hope companies will see the value of why Hopeline is needed. We are also very happy to get the youth and caring and concerned citizens who keep this initiative going to serve the mental challenges that people are undergoing. According to statistics, 43 percent of people are reaching the line of moderate depression because of fear and the anxiety from the uncertainty of the future. Kaya natin ito, buhat natin ang pag-asa.” Hopeline has the 10 Piso Mula Sa Puso campaign where people can use GCash to donate to the hotline. (The QR code is on www.facebook.com/HopelinePH.) Rollinas says, “We say your P10 can save a life. People really need someone to talk to, lalo ngayong pandemic. People call us seeking hope.

‘End the stigma—all feelings are valid!’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/389190/end-the-stigma-all-feelings-are-valid/,"07:41 PM October 03, 2021","What they want you to know about mental health As we count down to World Mental Health Day on Oct. 10, we asked mental health experts and advocates: What would you like to tell everyone about mental health? What would you like to tell someone struggling with their mental health? Here’s what they said: End the stigma. All feelings are valid! —Dr. Gia Baquiran Sison There is no simplistic, linear way to explain suicide, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety and all other mental health issues. It’s much more complex than a one-sentence, one-paragraph explanation. For survivors of suicide loss and mental health disorders, it takes years to a lifetime to fully grasp the situation. A little empathy and understanding go a long way. When there seems to be no one left, you have yourself. And you are enough. —Kate Alvarez, founder of SOS Philippines (Survivors of Suicide), facebook.com/sosphilippines, writer and mental health advocate I’d like to say the following: It’s ok to not be ok. You’re not alone and we’re here to listen and help. Your story matters and we want to be part of your journey to wellness. —Ronald John Recio, MA RPsy EMDRPRac MBPsS, clinical psychologist All of us at some point in our lives will hit rock bottom. When it barges in our doorstep, we should take it in. Because healing only happens the minute we face it. I may not be able to get a full grasp of what you are going through, but here’s my hand, willing to hold your heart. I am here and I will listen. —Kooky Tuason, spoken word artist/radio host/educator I wish to tell everyone having mental health issues that no matter how difficult it is for you, this is not the end. This will not last forever. Right now, for those who are struggling with their mental health, just hang in there. All this will pass. Use this pain to find greater purpose in your life. If you want someone to talk to, we are just a text or call away. —Marissa Jusay, family counselor, Ruben M. Tanseco, S.J. Center for Family Ministries When you hear people talk about their mental health problems, there’s always that level of relatability, and I think that’s where the danger stems from. It’s easy to think, “Hey, I’ve been through something similar and I just exercised, or took a walk, or ate a box of chocolates, chose to think positively and I got over it. I’m sure they could, too.” It’s not that easy. You can’t just pray/walk/exercise/drink/sleep/eat away the darkness. It’s different for everybody and you have to respect that. Sometimes, you can just help someone survive through a season until they’re ready for help, and sometimes, you just have to be there with them, and sit with the pain. You have to accept the fact that mental disorders are actual sicknesses in the same realm as hypertension, diabetes or cancer. Just like most disorders/diseases, key to a meaningful life is a good, supportive, loving community—and that includes you. From someone living with bipolar disorder, I have to say it: living with this is hard. And I’ve accepted the fact that my life’s not going to play out as I planned and I’ll have to carve my own path to a different version of success. But in spite of that, I have to be honest: I’m at peace with it, and finally I can say that it’s made me a better person. In my case, it hasn’t kept me from a full life. It’s a different life from what I imagined—but full nonetheless. So keep hope. And remember these three things: Stick to a sleep schedule, find a community that loves you and don’t let your disorder hold you back from seeing the big and small endless possibilities that life has to offer. —Jasper Hannah, media relations manager, freelance writer and artist Mental health is not just about mental illness. It is our state of well-being—an awareness of our strengths and potentials, our capacity to be resilient, to be productive and to contribute to our community. I’d like to tell someone who’s struggling with their mental health that their feelings are valid and that the fact that they are struggling means that they are fighting it out—that is courage. Also, that they are not alone, especially at this point when many people are struggling as well; they just need to reach out because help is available from at least one person around us who we can trust. And if this will not be enough and our functioning and our relationships are already affected, there are mental health professionals or institutions that we can seek help from. —Dr. Carolina Uno-Rayco, RGC, RPsy, national executive director, Philippine Mental Health Association, Inc.Nais kong ibahagi ang natutunan ko kay Dr. Dinah Nadera sa isang nakaraang webinar tungkol sa art therapy: “Ang kalusugang pampag- iisip ay tumutukoy sa lagay ng ginhawa na ang isang tao ay nakapagpapamalas ng sariling galing at gilas, nakakaangkop nang sapat sa mga normal na hamon ng buhay, nakapagpapakita ng tatag sa pagharap sa matinding dagok sa buhay, nakakapagtrabaho nang mahusay at mabunga at nakakapag-ambag ng tulong sa pamayanan.’ Napakahirap magpakatatag ngayong pandemya, at kahit nakakatulong ang pag-isolate ay maaring makaranas tayo ng malubhang kalungkutan o pagkabalisa. Paalala lang sa sarili—mahalaga ang nararamdaman at mahalaga ang buhay natin. Alagaan ang ating sarili at bigyan ng sapat na atensyon ang ating paghinga at pahinga. Humingi ng tulong kahit pa pakiramdam natin ay okay pa rin tayo. Magpakalakas at huwag hayaang maubos ang lakas. Pakinggan ang pintig ng pusong nagsasabing mahalaga ka at buhay ka pa. Sikaping mahalin ang sarili kahit pa paunti-unti araw araw. —Valene Lagunzad, mental health awareness advocate, Buhay Movement Mental health is a real issue and part of being human. We all experience highs and lows, and that is alright. Nothing wrong about that. We should be able to discuss this freely, and it should not be treated as a flaw. Acknowledge what you’re feeling. It’s alright. It is also okay to seek professional help. —Ruby Gan Mental health is just as important as physical health. Just because you don’t see a person’s suffering or symptoms, doesn’t mean it’s not there. There is no shame in looking to treat it; just as you would go to a doctor for a broken ankle or diabetes, you should seek treatment for mental health conditions as well. You are more than your bipolar disorder, your depression, your anxiety, your PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder). You have it; it does not have you. Talk to someone. Find a routine. Practice self-care. Take your medicines. Keep a gratitude journal. Exercise. Make that effort to do better and be better, but allow yourself to heal as well.—Erika Aquino, brand and marketing strategist, brewery owner and living with bipolar disorder Don’t waste time not taking care of yourself. Find what brings you happiness and meaning right now. Failing that, buy a corgi! —Mark Christian Parlade There are three things I really want every Filipino to know about mental health: 1. Our mental health is absolutely intertwined with our bodies. We need to know that we cannot think ourselves out of a dark season; in order to crawl out of these dark days and nights, we need to make sure our bodies move. It can be as simple as a five-minute walk, stretch all limbs, arms upward, legs shake move bend and stretch, and the one thing we all are chronically subject to but rarely note—try to periodically be aware of how your jaw is feeling. Unclench it as often throughout the day. You’ll be surprised at how much energy goes to your gritted teeth. It’s preventing you from smiling, and it depletes you of calm. Mind your jaw, and when you do you may feel the calm molecules settle in. 2. Mental wellness is not an on/off switch. Try to picture it like a volume button. It can go from one to four, then four to six then back to two again. It isn’t on-happy, then off-depressed, we are not machines. The good news is, many of us are sliding up and down that line—and we can do this slowly. Remember—instant things are rarely excellent. So be patient and work on your mood and disposition and function slowly. Tip: Do things slower, like when you brew coffee, or sip it slowly, bathe slower than usual, walk slowly to the kitchen, count your steps—these tiny movement things take you back to the present and this always helps. When your mind is in the past, you tend to be sad; when it’s in the future, it can be anxious or fearful. So drag your ass back to the present minute and slowly walk to the kitchen and back. Slow down, you’ll be surprised at how rushed you have lived your days. 3. If all else fails, nap. —Gang Badoy Capati, Trauma Research Foundation fellow, Boston; lead therapist, Project: Steady Asia INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"Welcome aboard ‘Crusher,’ Jeremy Zucker’s unapologetic angry era",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388583/welcome-aboard-crusher-jeremy-zuckers-unapologetic-angry-era/,"03:25 PM September 20, 2021","Chances are, your first experience with a Jeremy Zucker song starts off easy: A mellow tune found in a carefully curated “chill out” playlist, likely along the lines of their popular 2018 song “Comethru.” In my case, it was this. But much in the tradition of sophomore albums and artists’ need to reinvent, Jeremy’s upcoming record “Crusher” is a far leap from their first. Marked by unfettered anger and a more roaring sound, its musicality and overall look are a direct response to their 2020 debut “Love is Not Dying.” If its older sibling was a bit more morose in tone and lyrics thanks to themes of heartbreak, “Crusher” is coming to terms with that—and getting furious at the process, like a musical “to hell with it.”  “I felt like a little lost after [‘Love is Not Dying’]. It took me a while to figure out who I was and what I stood for. When you get wrapped up in relationships, like going through a breakup, it’s really easy to lose yourself when you have really strong feelings. ‘Crusher’ is finding myself again,” Jeremy explained during a recent press con. “‘Crusher’ is the realization that I was blatantly mistreated. There’s a lot of anger on the project because of that. The first handful of songs I wrote are just—I hate to say ‘mean,’ but music is emotion, right? I wasn’t writing it to get revenge. It’s an expression of anger that isn’t intended to hurt anyone,” they added.  Nonetheless, they called it their “most intense album” to date, which they consider “emotionally and sonically” the “peak” of their career. While loud anger is a blatant topic that’s hardly a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it sort of deal, “Crusher” is a kaleidoscope of feelings, with 12 tracks comprising of jumbled eclectic sounds and emotions. The album, according to the musician, is Jeremy at its most real, and it came about after a series of introspective moments with themself, as well as with their closest peers.   A post shared by @jeremyzucker   “The reason we’re all here is [because of] connection and relationships. Happiness is only real when it’s shared,” they said. “I’m starting to prioritize connections and friendships when you don’t get to really see people. I didn’t experience that many new things. But I think that’s why it’s coming across as more mature, because I’ve spent more time marinating, analyzing, and learning from things instead of writing about them right after they happen when emotions are really raw.” As their second album, “Crusher” is something different altogether. While they did leave little bits and pieces of their past self (They consider the track “Deep End” as the “perfect mix” of old them, “Love is Not Dying” them, and “Crusher” them), it’s still a big change, of sorts. “I didn’t want to fully reinvent myself, but I didn’t want to keep doing the same thing. My music taste was changing a lot and so was my life. They came out different because we also live in a very different time than we did two years ago,” they said.  And while it might alienate fans of their old stuff, Jeremy thinks that change is always necessary, especially when it comes to artists. “People always say, ‘Oh, I miss the old Kanye.’ If Kanye made another one of his classic albums, then that second one wouldn’t be a classic album.” From their more quiet music came noise, a prominent motif in “Crusher,” whether it’s the sound, the lyrics, the imagery, or the name of their North American tour aptly named “More Noise!!!!”. But to them, it isn’t really their take on the industry, where loud is sometimes thought of as better. “I don’t like the idea of competing for noise or for attention. The industry is very saturated and everyone feels like they have to make a lot of noise to get noticed, and I really try not to do that. That’s not really my motivation for all the energy in the volume, it’s more of just self-expression,” they said. “I don’t believe in the rat race mentality where everyone’s trying to scream over each other because what are [they] even saying at that point? When everyone’s screaming, you got to whisper to make everyone listen to you.” Despite the big changes, what ties it all together as a Jeremy Zucker track are raw feelings in lyrics, which many view as something relatable. Take their 2018 track “All The Kids Are Depressed,” a personal song echoing their and their friends’ situation during college, now made into a Gen Z mental health anthem for some. That might be the case now, but they didn’t seek it when writing the track.  “As selfish as it sounds, I’m writing music for myself. I think the second I try to write music for someone else for someone that I don’t know, it comes across as almost insincere or preachy,” they said. “I think it just goes to show how similar everyone is and all these things that we all go through, even though we couldn’t imagine someone else going through a similar thing or feeling the same way. I am making music now knowing that, but I’m still making it in the same way. I’m writing it for me, but I’m releasing it for them.” As they reinvent themself while sticking to their core beliefs at the same time, their listeners are kept on their toes. What will a Jeremy Zucker record be like next? That’s only for them to know, but now, we have “Crusher” on our horizon, in all its eclectic, angry, and very real glory. “Crusher” is slated for release on Oct. 1. Pre-save the album here.

How can a fitness tracker improve your exercise motivation,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388570/how-can-a-fitness-tracker-improve-you-exercise-motivation/,"02:36 PM September 20, 2021","Exercise can benefit your physical and mental health by strengthening your immune system and making you become more resilient against the effects of this pandemic. It’s never too late to start your fitness journey. You just need to have the right mindset, approach, and tools so you can be at your best health, soon. However, exercising at home for one and a half years can be a great challenge for some long-term exercisers when it comes to exercise motivation and consistency. That’s why we always need to find ways to move so we can sustain an active lifestyle which is essential to our survival. As a fitness coach, I keep myself motivated to exercise on a daily basis by choosing an exercise playlist based on my moods, by modifying my exercise moves for variety, and using a fitness tracker to monitor my exercise performance. A fitness tracker helps creates essential information about my exercise intensity (average heart rate) and energy expenditure (calorie burn) so I can stay consistent with the desired workout intensity, especially when I teach my fitness classes, to give participants a balanced workout experience. Here are the most important benefits of a fitness tracker and how you can effectively use it to achieve your fitness and health goals. One of the best ways to sustain your exercise motivation is to see results after all your hard work. Aside from feeling good about yourself after an intense workout session, you can track your exercise progress by checking your current exercise performance (exercise duration, average heart rate, and calories). Charly Yuhico, 44, Vice President of Viva Music and Artists Group, Inc., developed a new exercise perspective ever since she started using a Garmin watch in 2016. Sometimes, she texts me about her high-calorie burn right after our cardio + strength class or indoor cycling class. Charly shared how a fitness tracker keeps her motivation and energy level after all these years. “In the same way that a new and cute exercise outfit can motivate you to workout, I find that a fitness tracker has the same effects on your workouts. It really helps establish consistency and motivates you not to skip a day.” She notes, “Added bonus if you’re the type of person who likes to analyze numbers and data. Aside from knowing how many times a week you’ve worked out, you can see how intense each workout was, compare it to previous weeks and even measure improvements over time.  You can also upload your results to activity/training websites and share your week’s activities with friends.  It’s a great tool to use to ensure exercise continues to be an essential part of your life.” A fitness tracker can help create balance in your current exercise routine. Knowing and doing the appropriate volume of exercise that matches your food intake, fitness goals and health condition can help you to avoid overexercising which can lead to overeating and exercise injuries. You can always check your heart rate during a workout session and see if you are exerting too much, so you can always take a break and resume once you’re within the target heart rate, which is based on your age. Malou Fores, 56, chef/restaurateur, Mamou, who has been training with me for two decades, remains consistent with her workouts by always finding the balance in her weekly routine. She got her Apple Watch early this year that makes her more motivated to continue her workouts like strength training, Ashtanga yoga, tennis, swimming, brisk walking, and hiking. “My fitness watch has motivated me to move and be active and reminded me that I could do better than I what did the day/week/ or even month ago. It’s wonderful to be able to measure my improvements while visualizing my health and fitness goals. It also prevents me from overworking my body, so I don’t injure myself by pushing too hard,” Malou explains. You can use your fitness tracker to achieve your weight goals by monitoring your calorie burn. It can help you choose the correct exercises that can help achieve your calorie burn target. Calorie burn depends on your weight (heavier weight, higher burn) and heart rate (higher heart rate, higher burn). A pound of fat is equivalent to 3,500 calories. If you can burn 300 calories a day, six days a week (2,100 calories) from formal workouts, then you can already lose half a pound per week from exercise only. The other half of the equation is your food intake.  You can still lose additional weight per week by controlling the quantity and quality of your food. Anna Tayag, 44, housewife, enjoys using her fitness tracker to achieve her fitness and weight goals. She loves trying different workouts to keep her motivated. Last month, we started discussing how she can maximize the use of her fitness tracker by balancing her exercise with her food intake. Anna shares, “The fitness tracker has helped me a lot! I remember when I first got the 1st gen Apple Watch and realized I could no longer work out without using one. Now I have a Xiaomi mi smart band 6 watch. I’m not guessing anymore and know exactly how many calories I burned for each of my activities. With it, I can gauge if I’m under or over-exerting myself by tracking my heart rate. It keeps a record of all my strength and cardio workouts also for the year. Knowing how many calories I burned per workout per day, keeps my food intake count in check. I feel good when I eat, knowing that I need to fuel my body after a hard workout.”  Improved sports performance Consider other fitness tracker features that are compatible with your sports so you can effectively track, analyze and improve your performance. If you are a runner, get a watch that has advanced features like a built-in GPS.  If you swim, choose a waterproof watch with a lap counter. Kat Luna-Abelarde, 47, corporate executive at PLDT, and triathlete, used to join triathlons and run races before the pandemic.  I started seeing her for lifestyle coaching this year to find balance in her eating and exercise (indoor and outdoor cycling, yoga, or strength training) so can she can continue to achieve her fitness goals. Kat says, “I have been using sports watches for over 10 years but primarily for competitive training purposes. In the last few years though, and especially during the pandemic, I started to practice a more mindful, and holistic approach to wellness.” She adds, “I learned to appreciate all kinds of movement plus the value of nutrition. The Apple fitness tracker keeps me accountable for all of these aspects of health: from the most basic, breathing and standing to the more complicated ECG, VO2Max and HRV. It’s convenient, simple, and data-rich. I have set aside all my mechanical watches. Maybe I should put them up for sale soon.” Aside from the formal exercise sessions discussed, it is also important to make lifestyle activities consistent, like moving around the house, walking leisurely, or doing errands to accumulate a certain number of steps (at least 7,000 steps a day). You can get even a very simple fitness tracker that can measure your number of steps, heart rate, and calories burned. Always finding an opportunity to move as a habit, having a fitness routine, eating a well-balanced diet, and getting enough rest and sleep will definitely create wonders for your health long-term. Pia Abuel-Ang, 48, Agricultural Specialist, USDA, has been exercising for years. We used to join full marathons years ago and I have witnessed how her goals have progressed from weight loss, beating her personal best, and now sustaining a healthy lifestyle. Pia mentions, “Using a fitness tracker helps me validate how I’m actually doing. After a good night’s sleep and I feel well-rested, checking my sleep score on the fitness tracker helps confirm this. “I also use the fitness tracker to monitor my heart rate, to see if I am working out in my fat burning or cardio state. Seeing my resting heart rate go down and seeing my fitness levels improve makes me happy and keeps me motivated. Have been using a Fitbit watch for over four years now and having a record of my daily activities (i.e., steps, calories burned, exercise) lets me know if I need to do more to maintain my health. For me, it’s been an indispensable tool to help me reach my goals,” she explains.

My cat is a failed Zumba instructor,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388441/my-cat-is-a-failed-zumba-instructor/,"06:07 PM September 17, 2021","On last week’s episode of “Please Make My Cats Famous,” I turned my cat Onion into an alt TikTok baddie à la Rih. This week, Astro is once again taking over the mantle—and getting some exercise in. Astro is very famously a big boi, my large son, a huge chonk, and an absolute unit. My friends jokingly ask me why I got a large cat when I’m so short. In truth, I had no idea Astro was going to get this big. Believe it or not, he’s half Munchkin. Him being as large as my torso is a surprise to me, too. The boy is also around 12 pounds heavy. He’s twice the size of Onion. While our vet said that he’s not yet at an unhealthy weight level, he’s close to it, which is why it’s important to keep him moving. Unfortunately, it’s a bit harder to get Astro active. He’s not interested in most toys. That’s why, before the pandemic started, we used to go on short walks together. (Harness-train your cats, folks.) However, we had to stop because I wasn’t going to risk my cat getting COVID-19 too. Since fitness and exercise culture is a big part of the internet, especially on Instagram, I wanted to explore that with the big boy—and hopefully try to get him active (safely) again. For this, I interviewed transformation coach and fitness influencer Ramona Julia Sucgang-Bonoan. A few years ago, she helped me fix my diet and nutrition (though I haven’t kept it up at all especially since the pandemic hit—sorry Julia!). She also has a ton of cats herself, which is why I thought she was perfect for this. During our interview, I asked her about the shady side of the IG fitness world, where some people end up promoting harmful practices or mislead their followers. She told me that she doesn’t like calling out specific people and she works on becoming a better example instead. “I focus on myself. You have to be a good example [to counteract them]. You have to use your platform to inspire people.” It empowers her own followers. She also told me that she doesn’t like calling anything good or bad, and doesn’t like demonizing meals. “Instead of saying that something is a bad diet, I say it’s a nutrition-deficit meal.” Julia is a mental health advocate, too. She speaks up about it a lot and she’s very vocal about her own experience with depression. It’s pretty noteworthy considering that there’s still unfortunately a lot of people in the fitness world who are not as kind or aware when it comes to topics on mental health. For Astro, Julia told me it would be really cute if I turned him into a Zumba instructor. “Cats look really cute when they look like they’re dancing,” she said. She suggested I put a headband on him and pretend that he’s leading an exercise class. Before I started with that challenge though, I attempted to get my cat walking again. My building’s rooftop is quite scenic—it resembles a park a little bit—so a number of residents have started going there to go jogging and the like. I also knew that there was a gym near the area, too. I figured that if I went there, I could either get Astro on a treadmill or have him run alongside the plants on the rooftop. Both ideas turned out to be a bust—the gym was closed (and I think probably wouldn’t let my cat inside) and Astro ran *away* from everything. It was honestly kind of comical hearing people exclaim, “Uy, pusa,” while my cat ran away from them. I also tried to walk him around the corridor. However, whenever he heard a door open, he would sprint as fast as he could toward it, dragging me along with him. It took all my strength to get him from entering a stranger’s unit and it left me feeling winded. With those failed attempts out of the way, I started with Julia’s Zumba challenge. I don’t own an exercise headband, let alone one for cats, but I did have an old skirt with an elastic waist. So I cut it open and fashioned a headband out of it. It turned out really cute on Astro, if I do say so myself, even if it kept slipping off. The Zumba challenge itself, however, turned out to be the hardest challenge I had to do so far. First of all, Astro was extremely heavy, which meant I could carry him up with only one hand without my arm buckling over. This made it harder for me to remain off-screen. In our best take, I’m still in full view of the camera. And I had to maneuver all that while also trying to keep the headband on his head. Astro also kept kicking away my camera rig, which meant I had to redo it over and over again. Despite the talent being difficult, we did end up with some cute photos and a nice li’l video. Still, a Zumba instructor, he is not.  A post shared by Lifestyle Inquirer Official (@lifestyle.inquirer)   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
It’s 100 days ‘til Christmas and it’s all about caring and giving at SM Supermalls,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388382/its-100-days-til-christmas-and-its-all-about-caring-and-giving-at-sm-supermalls/,"05:46 PM September 16, 2021","The past years have always had us counting down to the most wonderful time of the year when the ‘ber’ months roll in; Christmas carols fill the air, dazzling tree lights dot the streets, shopping for gifts becomes a sport, and everyone else goes on a diet to make way for Christmas feasts. This year may not be as festive as previous years, but it will most certainly be more meaningful. SM showed us the most uplifting way to best celebrate the season with “100 Days of Caring”;  featuring 100 days of spreading love, thoughtfulness, and care for one another and for the communities surrounding our favorite SM malls. The virtual event showcasing the pledges happened Thursday, Sept 16, 2021 over FB Live and WatchSM on YouTube. “100 days of Caring”. To kickstart the Christmas countdown, SM pledged to donate to over 10,000 beneficiaries, namely communities in need, hardworking SM employees, medical frontliners and dedicated delivery partners, among others. Some of the beneficiaries and their partner malls are as follows: ‘Gift’ for your mental health. Aside from our physical health being at risk during a pandemic, our mental health is also affected due to the stress and anxiety these times bring. And since SM believes in the value of taking care of our mental health, Dr Gia Sison, MD DPCOM gave a  ‘Call to Share’ talk during the virtual launch. Dr Gia Sison is a mental health advocate and co-founder of PH Leader Livestrong Foundation. Her talk centered on how to cope during this stressful time and still find hope in a better tomorrow.  100 voices that care. If there’s one thing that binds us all Filipinos together, it’s our passion and love for music. While we may not be allowed to have big gatherings this year, SM entertained the audience with the performance of the 3 Divas – Rahda, Frenchie and Bituin Escalante; later on joined by 100 artists, singers, and SM employees and stakeholders who came together to sing during the virtual launch on Sept 16.

Filipinos urged to join conversation for World Suicide Prevention Day,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388050/filipinos-urged-to-join-conversation-for-world-suicide-prevention-day/,"07:21 PM September 09, 2021","This World Suicide Prevention Day, the Bayanihan for WellBeing (BWB) Collaborative urges every Filipino to join conversations on mental health and suicide through the event “Together We Can: Preventing Suicide As One.” The BWB Collaborative was convened in 2020 by Unilab Foundation’s Heads Up PH Program to address surging cases of mental health issues in the country through a multidisciplinary, multilevel and holistic approach. Among its founding members are the Philippine Guidance and Counseling Association, Psychological Association of the Philippines, Philippine Psychiatric Association, Philippine Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Philippine Pediatric Society. The online event aims to convene stakeholders and mental health advocates to raise awareness of the threat suicide poses in our society today, while leading conversations on how to properly address this in the time of a global pandemic. In the Philippines, mental health issues and suicide cases continue to rise, especially among the youth. According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2020), over 27 million Filipino learners from public and private schools and over 880,000 educators from public schools are affected by this crisis. Competing health problems, financial setbacks, stigma and poor understanding of the issue also contribute to the low prioritization of suicide prevention. The Global School-based Student Health Survey (2015) revealed that 16.8 percent of Filipino students aged 13-17 years have attempted suicide, and 11.6 percent seriously considered attempting suicide during the 12 months before the survey. The event will tackle the situation of mental health in the Philippines and present various actions and initiatives on suicide prevention and intervention. Participating are speakers from organizations such as the World Health Organization-Philippines, Disease Prevention and Control Bureau-Essential Non-Communicable Disease Division of the Department of Health, the University of Hong Kong, the Asian Institute of Management, and other mental health experts and advocates. The event also marks the launch of the Race Against Suicide Toolkit, a manual that aims to provide a more holistic approach to suicide prevention and mental health wellness in schools. This tool kit was created by mental health professionals with Dr. Kenneth Ross Javate, a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist, as its principal author. It is for use by teachers, guidance counselors and school administrators in their own school communities, to enable them to efficiently recognize and refer learners at risk for suicide. The tool kit will be turned over to various government agencies during the event. Additionally, results of the Asian Institute of Management’s study on the health landscape in the country, Project Ligaya (funded by Unilab Foundation), will also be presented.  “Together We Can: Preventing Suicide As One” is free and open to all. It will be on Sept. 10, 10 a.m.-12 noon; register at bit.ly/TogetherWeCanRegForm; watch the livestream at the Bayanihan for WellBeing Facebook page on facebook.com/BayanihanForWellBeing.

45 minutes of daily exercise have been my lifeline,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387391/45-minutes-of-daily-exercise-have-been-my-lifeline/,"02:09 PM August 24, 2021","While there are days when I don’t feel like it, I still make it a point to show up. These online classes have become my ‘me time,’ a relief from my daily routine Working for the media industry in this day and age is not easy. But then again, nothing about this pandemic is easy. As the vice president and group advertising head of the Inquirer, there are a lot of hurdles to overcome and demands to be met. Add being a mother to the mix, especially with the recent reports of kids now being infected by the virus, and you’re bound for an inevitable cocktail of anxiety. But if there is one thing that helps me keep it together, it’s the online catch-ups that my teammates and I engage in each week. Despite the growing stress caused by the pandemic, it’s a comfort to know that I’m not alone. Making it through each day looks different for everyone. I personally abide by the principle that I need to be well so that I can properly take care of my family, my team and myself. For me, self-care means ordering in when I don’t have time to cook and giving in to my cravings every so often without shaming myself for it. Prior to the pandemic, I was physically active. Having suffered from postpartum depression during my first pregnancy, I discovered the joys of working out and went on to try different activities, such as barre, dance, yoga and running. But when the lockdown started, my activities ground to a halt. In May 2020, I enrolled in Electric Studio’s online class. It became my safe space and I never looked back. While there are days when I don’t feel like I am making any progress, I still make it a point to show up anyway. These classes have become my “me time,” a relief from my daily routine of work, looking after the household, baking, and assisting my two children in online schooling. The goal for me isn’t weight loss but balance. What I’ve found is that endorphins truly do make me happy. While I may have found joy in cycling online, doing it every day still isn’t enough. I need strength training and other exercises to mix it up with. That being said, I’m happy that Electric has managed to keep up with the needs of its community. They were the first to have online classes, both live and on demand. They rent out and sell bikes, gear and equipment. They’ve also pivoted, introducing various classes besides cycling, from strength, boxing, and flow, to core and high-intensity interval training. I recently finished Electric’s 21-day challenge, which I did not do for any award or prize. I did it for myself because I believe I deserve the time to invest in myself every single day. These 45 minutes reserved for exercise every day have been my lifeline. I’m extra lucky to get the support of my family—from my two little daughters who push me to work out every day, to my husband, who encourages me to buy workout clothes every once in a while so that I stay inspired. We survive each day by holding each other up.  Being a part of this community has inspired me. It’s inclusive, and there are people who are just like me—people who have stressful jobs, people who have kids to tend to, and people who are also probably stuck at home living through the monotony that each day presents. The endorphins that I get from working out give me the hope and level of optimism that we’ll get through this pandemic together (as one community). I may not know everyone in the class, but it is a joy to see them push themselves one day at a time. Working out gives me this infectious energy that I bring to the office and the home every day. It gives me the endurance I need to keep myself happy, and the stamina to go through the demands of everyday life. It’s one of the few Zoom meetings I always look forward to attending. I may be a silent rider and I turn my camera off at times, but I hold myself accountable every single time. I am so grateful for the coaches, the owners and the community for giving us this opportunity to take a breather and take care of ourselves at a time like this. I talked to some members of my newfound community to ask them about their own Electric experience. It’s nice to know what we all share in finding a safe space in hard times. Here’s what they had to say: “The reality is that it’s never been this difficult to stay motivated. And that’s OK. What helps me is to focus on small wins, such as having adequate sleep, being able to eat meals on time and carving out some time to work out. Sometimes, these small steps are enough, and what we also need. More than the space, the reset that I get for myself each time I teach, it’s the fulfillment of seeing how my classes have impacted the lives of my riders not only physically, but also mentally. This experience inspires me to be better, whether as a coach, with my day job at Facebook, or as a person in general.” “Being an instructor in Electric is like varsity training. It’s something I look forward to at the end of the day. It helps me disconnect from everything that’s going on and does wonders for my mental health, apart from the physical. I get so motivated seeing riders show up, and it makes me feel like we’re a team and a family that can get through these tough times together.” “I’ve been attending their off-bike classes since they offered it because it provides a variety of classes that complement each other. I am fortunate because other people respect that working out is important to me and are willing to adjust meeting schedules.” “Having the ability to move motivates me enough to put in the work every single day, even during days when I feel down. Every time I have the chance to move, I do it.” “I keep coming back to Electric because of the community it has built. I’ve met a lot of people since I joined in April 2018. The fam vibes just make it addictive.”  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"10 years after Winehouse death, family ‘reclaims’ her story",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/386127/10-years-after-winehouse-death-family-reclaims-her-story/,"04:38 PM July 23, 2021","Amy Winehouse may still be best known for her line: “They tried to make me go to rehab. But I said no, no, no.” But 10 years after the British singer’s death at 27, her family and friends say it is time to stop defining her by her well-documented struggles with addiction and destructive relationships. Winehouse’s parents have cooperated with a BBC documentary to air on the anniversary of her death on Friday, which her father Mitchell, known as Mitch, says gives a “more rounded image of Amy”. The singer put her own experiences into original songs, such as “Back to Black” and “Rehab”, infused with jazz and soul influences and developed a distinctive personal style with a towering beehive hairdo and tattoos. But her performances grew more erratic due to drug and alcohol use while tabloids published stories calling her “Amy Decline-house” or “wino”. She died from alcohol poisoning on July 23, 2011. Narrated by her mother Janis Winehouse-Collins and titled “Reclaiming Amy”, the documentary to air on BBC2 features interviews with long-standing friends, including one, Catriona Gourley, who reveals she had a romantic relationship with Winehouse. “You think you know my daughter — the drugs, the addiction, the destructive relationships — but there was so much more,” her mother says in the voiceover. The documentary also seeks to counter accusations that her family relished her success and did not do enough to help her overcome addiction. ‘You killed your daughter’ -This was the main thrust of “Amy”, an Oscar-winning British documentary from 2015, which was particularly damning about Mitch and Winehouse’s ex-husband Blake Fielder-Civil. “I still get it now: ‘You were complicit in your daughter’s death, you killed your daughter’,” her father says in the documentary. Winehouse’s friend Gourley told BBC Radio 4, the reality was different: “Janis and Mitch were there, all the time,” she insisted, listing “the countless times she (Amy) was taken to rehab facilities or there was an intervention”. Gourley also suggested that with today’s greater awareness of mental health issues and addiction, Winehouse would not face such mockery in tabloids and gossip magazines. “The language… that was used about her at the time. I just don’t think people would get away with it, especially when it came to her mental health”. NME music magazine called the documentary “touching if defensive”, saying it was a “sweet tribute to a daughter, friend, and mercurial talent”. But The Financial Times was more skeptical, writing that Winehouse’s parents and especially “lime-light-loving father Mitch were front and centre in her career”. At one point in the documentary, Mitch smiles and is “seemingly oblivious” as he watches a clip in which Winehouse duets with him while “embarrassingly drunk”, it adds. Her messy private life apart, Winehouse was one of the “icons who changed popular music forever”, NME wrote. “Few tower as high as Amy Winehouse and her unmistakable beehive.” British singer Pete Doherty in an interview with BBC Radio 2 called her “someone like Billie Holiday or John Lennon, just someone who had it all”. Winehouse “looked the part” and “could perform live with scary aplomb” as well as being an “incredible songwriter”, said the former Babyshambles singer. “In a hundred years’ time, in 200 years’ time, kids are still going to be falling in love with Amy Winehouse.” Pianist Jools Holland, who often accompanied her, told BBC radio: that “it seemed to me that when she was performing she was most content”. “I don’t think she would have wanted to be remembered as a tragic figure.”  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Frontrunners emerge in Miss World Philippines ‘fast-track’ events,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/386068/frontrunners-emerge-in-miss-world-philippines-fast-track-events/,"12:55 PM July 23, 2021","   MANILA, Philippines—As the 2021 Miss World Philippines (MWP) pageant approaches the homestretch, with most of its preliminary competitions already finished, several candidates have emerged as frontrunners. The national pageant adopted the international Miss World pageant’s format of staging “fast-track” events whose winners advance to the next stage of competition. The Charity Gala Night held at the grand ballroom of Okada Manila in Parañaque City on July 22 featured the National Costume and Top Model fast-track competitions. At the event’s culmination, several candidates who have figured in the previously concluded preliminary contests once again got the call. Leading the pack is Taguig City’s Emmanuelle Vera, who made it to the Top 10 of both the national costume and top model competitions.  She had earlier advanced in the Beach Beauty, Sports, Talent, and Head-to-Head challenges. Broadcast journalist Ganiel Krishnan from Kawit, Cavite, also advanced in both contests conducted during the gala. She had earlier made it on the list of the Beach Beauty, Beauty with a Purpose, and Multimedia challenges.   Tracy Maureen Perez from Cebu City also got called twice in the gala. She was also included in the shortlist for the Beach Beauty, and Head-to-Head challenges.  Bataan lass Dindi Pajares is also among the double qualifiers in Wednesday’s gala. She also advanced in the Beach Beauty and Beauty with a Purpose event. Taguig City’s Asha Gutierrez, who had earlier advanced in the Sports and Beach Beauty events, also qualified for the National Costume and Top Model awards.   The twin contests served as the highlight of the gala event, which also featured performances from the 10 delegates who qualified for the talent award. MWP National Director Arnold Vegafria said the annual charity gala serves as an important fund-raising event for the pageant’s programs. “Aside from our ongoing MWP scholarship program, we are also jumpstarting our very own mental health advocacy,” he said. He said the candidates are encouraged to seek or initiate their advocacies, in line with the Beauty with a Purpose program, adopted from the global Miss World pageant. “Beyond the beauty and the glam, this is the purposeful life that we encourage all our candidates to aspire for,” Vegafria continued. The 2021 Miss World Philippines coronation night will be on July 25 also at the grand ballroom of Okada Manila. Aside from the main crown, the pageant will also bestow the following titles: Miss Supranational Philippines, Miss Eco Philippines, Reina Hispanoamericana Filipinas, Miss Tourism Philippines, Miss Environment Philippines, and Miss Eco Teen Philippines.

These stories are different compared with episodes when a celebrity’s story is featured, she noted during the online press conference last July 6 for the show. Meanwhile, the episode where she is set to appear will air on July 24 on the Kapamilya Channel at A2Z. “Sa artista kasi a lot of times alam na natin, eh, dahil nababalita na sa industriya and people talk about the artistas. Ako, kapag gumagawa ako ng MMK, I am always so amazed by the courage and strength of ordinary people,” she said.

She cited her role in the episode to air this Saturday, where she plays a mother who bonded with a total stranger, Heaven Peralejo. The episode is close to Buencamino’s heart as it tackles mental illness which is one of the issues she advocates for. In 2015, she and husband, fellow veteran actor Nonie Buencamino, lost a daughter who suffered from depression. Peralejo plays Julie in the episode, whose mother, Caridad (Iza Calzado), develops schizophrenia. Because of the responsibilities suddenly left to her, Julie begins to resent Caridad.

Campus queen aims for the ‘world’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/385956/campus-queen-aims-for-the-world/,"05:15 PM July 21, 2021","MAKATI CITY, Philippines — She was proclaimed queen of public scholars when she bagged the Miss PASUC (Philippine Association of State Universities and Colleges) crown in 2017, now Joy Barcoma aims for a bigger title—Miss World Philippines. The former working student also took home the 2017 Miss Philippine Islands crown while pursuing her degree in broadcasting at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, and finished second in the 2018 Miss Mandaluyong pageant. Armed with commendable pageant experience, Barcoma gained enough confidence to aspire to become the country’s representative in the biggest and longest-running international beauty pageant in the world. Barcoma sees the Miss World Philippines stage as a platform where she can effectively promote mental health awareness to a bigger audience, and hopes to take advantage of the global arena of the Miss World pageant to amplify her voice and further bring the matter to international consciousness, especially now that the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted countless of people around the world. “The reason I joined is to promote mental health literacy. We need to educate people, starting with our own families,” Barcoma told a select group of media scribes at a recent virtual conference. “I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I thought I was okay, that it was normal,” she confessed. Barcoma appealed to people to know their mental health status and urged others to listen and be more empathetic. She went on to discuss how a person’s mental health condition affects relationships with family and friends, and impacts performance in school and work. “It’s something we need to take a good look at,” she continued. She also noted how families of patients at the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) abandon their own loved ones seeking treatment. “These people are already aware of the gravity, how much families affect healing. If they abandon their family, there is nothing more we can do. The best way is to educate everyone,” Barcoma explained. She said building a holistic approach to the mental health situation in the country may elicit enough support from the people. “So that if the family can’t be there, then we can be there for them (abandoned NCMH patients),” Barcoma declared. To further push this, Barcoma launched her “I’m Here” campaign to encourage community involvement by listening and being there for one another. The movement also seeks the creation of safe spaces for people where they can seek professional help without the fear of any stigma associated with mental health illnesses. The pageant scene, itself, is bereft of mental health “situations” where participants experience severe online bullying from fans of rival contestants. “As beauty queens, we are in a competition, but we are not competing with each other,” Barcoma addressed the critics, urging them to observe magnanimity. “We fight for the people we care about, the purpose we want to show. The crown is just a bonus,” she continued. Barcoma once dreamed of looking at the world from outer space as an astronaut, now she dreams of conquering the world through a crown, while her feet are still firmly planted on the ground. Barcoma competes with 44 other candidates in the 2021 Miss World Philippines pageant. The national competition took a break in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from the top title, the pageant will also bestow the following crowns: Miss Supranational Philippines, Miss Eco Philippines, Reina Hispanoamericana Filipinas, Miss Tourism Philippines, Miss Environment Philippines, and Miss Eco Teen Philippines. The coronation night is scheduled to take place at the grand ballroom of Okada Manila in Parañaque City on July 25.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Iza Calzado plays mother with schizophrenia in ‘Maalaala Mo Kaya’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/385321/iza-calzado-plays-mother-with-schizophrenia-in-maalaala-mo-kaya/,"04:41 PM July 07, 2021","Award-winning actress Iza Calzado considers as special her latest “Maalaala Mo Kaya” appearance because she nearly lost the opportunity to do it. “Alam mo ‘yung minsan na may dumarating na alam mong para sa iyo siya,” she initially said during the online press conference for the drama anthology yesterday, July 6. (You know those occasions, when you know something comes along just for you.) “And then nag-free ‘yung schedule ko and they already offered it to somebody else. That person said suddenly ay hindi siya puwede,” Calzado revealed. (My schedule freed up, but then they already offered it to somebody else. That person suddenly was not available.) Calzado is playing Caridad, the protective mom of Heaven Peralejo’s Julie character, and who also has schizophrenia. Because of the responsibilities suddenly passed on to her, Julie begins to resent her sick mother until Esther (Shamaine Centenera) came to her life and became her other mom. “It was almost like I was the letter-sender and I could understand what the letter-sender went through in some ways,” Calzado said. While the condition of Calzado’s character differs from that of her own mom (her departed mother had bipolar syndrome), for her, acting the part “became just a choice also of making sure that [we get to show that condition] and make it human, to humanize what they are going through, what the family has to go through.” Calzado believes the episode is important and that it allows artists like her “to serve [their] purpose not only as actors but as mental health advocates.” “Maalaala Mo Kaya” is streamed every Saturday, 8:30 p.m. on the Kapamilya Channel, A2Z, Kapamilya Online Live YouTube channel, ABS-CBN Entertainment Facebook page and iWantTFC. For viewers outside the Philippines, it can be watched on the The Filipino Channel on cable and IPTV. JB RELATED STORIES: Iza Calzado ‘forever grateful’ to onscreen rival Jodi Sta.

Self-compassion: The loving begins with you,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/385225/self-compassion-the-loving-begins-with-you/,"04:45 PM July 04, 2021","“I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peace—a connection to what matters.”—Oprah Winfrey Look inwards. The loving begins with you. Coming into the second half of 2021, I wonder if I have fully utilized the first six months to grow into a more spiritual and soulful person with a more grounded life purpose. Still navigating this ever-evolving pandemic, I feel I need to work on a higher sense of self-worth and challenge my critical inner voice to remove destructive thoughts. The first step in building self-worth is to stop comparing one’s self to others and stop being so critical of every move, especially in a relationship. The critical inner voice is like a nasty coach in our heads that constantly nags us with negative emotions. Loving one’s self is a skill that takes time to perfect; however, the act of being compassionate to oneself is hardly every perfect. Perfection is not the intended goal, though—it’s all in the practice. And though each act of compassion toward ourselves may feel small, they are the building blocks for a strong foundation of falling in love with who we are—and all that we can be. By practicing mindfulness, we reduce our tendency to ruminate on problems or negative forms of thinking that are not conducive to real growth or change. The practice of self-compassion can help us avoid self-limiting or destructive thought processes, like the critical inner voice that often diminishes our motivation or initiative. We all need something positive to hang on to, to build hope and motivation moving forward. That’s why I want to talk about gratitude. Not only do we have to face the daily insecurity and trauma of COVID. Our world is also rife with racial injustice, destructive fires and storms, political upheaval and other hardships. Being grateful and looking at the bright side are just hollow concepts, unless you can truly feel aware of the sources of goodness in your life. Just knowing the silver lining is real—that there are things to be grateful for, things that make a positive difference in life—is a start. The value of our life is our true priceless self worth. Making good and healthy choices is a constant pursuit. Like practice for any instrument, test, sport, job, lecture or relationship, it takes ongoing practice to remind us to keep working on our character traits. We don’t have to feel obligated to get carried away by the feeling or all the what ifs that our minds can throw at us. Instead, we can step back and recognize them as just thoughts and feelings, and not as absolute truths. Meditation has been found to improve overall mental health, especially in relieving stress and anxiety. By taking the time to allow our body to relieve itself of stress, we are at the same time practicing self-compassion. In the process of cultivating the much-needed skill of showing ourselves compassion, we also string along a whole other list of benefits, such as strengthening our resilience, learning to cope in a healthy way, and improving our overall emotional well-being. When this reality is denied or resisted, suffering arises in the form of stress, frustration and self-criticism. However, when this reality is accepted with benevolence, we generate positive emotions of kindness and care that help us cope. Our character is defined by values. These core values are the result of our behavior. That means these values are defined by our actions—not the other way around. Authenticity is a core value that makes one unafraid of other people’s judgements. Stay true to yourself. Be the same person at every occasion in life. Truthfulness is connected to being authentic. Be honest about who you are and what you’ve done. Joy and love are core values that should be ever-present, especially in any relationship. Life is short so do things that bring you joy. Joyfulness should be part of anyone’s daily life. Get to know your siblings on a deeper level. Have two or three friends that you spend your time with. Love your family. Own your actions, mistakes and current life situation. Responsibility is fully owning wrongdoings and being accountable without passing fault or blame. Stay loyal and faithful. Once you build a bond with someone, don’t break it unless it’s necessary. But most importantly, stay loyal to yourself. Never sacrifice your own mental well-being for others. Treat yourself like you treat someone you love. In each of our lifetimes, we will be faced with struggles, big and small, internal and external. The pursuit of self-compassion will allow us to face these obstacles with a sense that, not only are we on our own team, but we are very much a part of a larger team. Life, indeed, is a journey with abundant opportunities and limitless detours. What could be more glorious and gratifying than taking chances to keep the fire of your inner artists ablaze? The León Gallery International, in cooperation with Derek Flores of DF Art Agency, recently presented its latest art exhibition “Art Detour.” The featured artists included architect Juan Carlo Calma, photographer Jay Yao (Jose Campos III), Korean artist Wonhee Cha Delgado or “Whee,” creative director Tracie Anglo Dizon, interior designer Kim Lim, and pop culture artist, painter and sculptor Ciane Xavier. In their own powerful artistry, they depicted their personal passion and zeal for the arts. Dizon, a creative director turned painter, has dedicated her productive years to the arts. I was glad to bump into her in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where we enjoyed a soulful visit. Whee exhibited masterpieces with provocative strokes, vibrant palettes and definite textures. Just before the pandemic last year, Whee married my cousin Rashid Alexander Delgado at a lovely traditional festive celebration.

"Miss Bikini PH, Miss FIT PH to hold live pageants this year",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/385066/miss-bikini-ph-miss-fit-ph-to-hold-live-pageants-this-year/,"09:22 PM June 30, 2021","MAKATI CITY, Philippines — Two nationwide pageants that conducted online competitions in 2020 will hold live ceremonies this year. At a media conference held in Quezon City on June 28, ProMedia CEO Paul Izon Reyes said his company’s two national pageants, the Miss Bikini Philippines and Miss FIT Philippines, “will not be virtual” this year. “The Miss FIT Philippines will be held in September, while the Miss Bikini Philippines will be sometime November or December,” he continued. ProMedia markets itself as a “fitness project management company.” Reyes clarified the dynamics between the two competitions and said Miss FIT Philippines is the “younger sister” of the Miss Bikini Philippines pageant. “Miss FIT—face, intelligence, tone—promotes holistic fitness, while Miss Bikini is leaning more towards ‘beauty’ while still promoting overall health,” he explained. Last year’s Miss Bikini Philippines saw 2019 winner Louise Theunis relinquish her title virtually to the new queen, Chelsea Fernandez, at the culmination of the online competition. Theunis also served as national director of the Miss FIT Philippines tilt, which was held a few months before she turned over her national crown. Now Theunis will see action on the virtual plane herself, as she competes in the 2021 Miss Philippines Earth pageant. She represents Carrascal town in the province of Surigao del Sur in the second virtual edition of the 21-year-old national pageant. Theunis is one of what Reyes refers to as ProMedia’s “pageant athletes.” He said the pageant contenders train and compete like athletes, and his company provides holistic support for the aspirants they are supporting, such as fitness regimens, nutrition plans, and mental health guidance. Joining Theunis in the Miss Philippines Earth pageant are fellow “pageant athletes,” Miss Bikini Philippines runner-up Elda Aznar of Davao City, and Miss FIT Philippines runner-up Anita Gomez of Olongapo City. Joining the Miss World Philippines pageant from the ProMedia stable is Natasha Jung, who first joined the 2020 Miss Bikini Philippines contest. But the first to see action is reigning Miss Caloocan Shanon Tampon, who is competing in the 2021 Binibining Pilipinas pageant culminating on July 11. Tampon said “swimsuit is my forte” and thanked her “pageant athlete” training for her competitive form. The animal rights advocate had already earned a Marketing Management degree from the Far Eastern University but is currently taking up Mechanical Engineering at the New Era University. The five ladies are just the first batch of contenders fielded by ProMedia to national competitions. They are currently grooming two more aspirants who may join the national arena next year. Reyes said he hopes his pageants will continue to serve as a springboard to bigger competitions. Before Janicel Lubina and Angelee delos Reyes earned their Binibining Pilipinas-International and Miss Philippines-Earth crowns, respectively, they first took home the Miss Bikini Philippines title.

Coping with trauma: ‘You are not alone; we are all in this together’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/384750/coping-with-trauma-you-are-not-alone-we-are-all-in-this-together/,"07:14 PM June 24, 2021"," Going through deeply distressing events such as forced isolation, losing a loved one, physical and verbal abuse, natural disasters, and other extraordinary experiences shatters our sense of security. These may leave us struggling with emotions that have long-term physical and mental effects on leading to trauma.  Recovering from trauma may take a while, but Dr. Gina A. Alfonso, Founder and Clinical Director of MAGIS Creative Spaces, assured those suffering from stressful circumstances that “You are not alone. We are all in this together.” Dr. Alfonso, a mental health clinician, who also experienced trauma herself in the past, was the resource speaker at Globe and the Department of Education (DepEd)’s TAYO! Naman! (Tulong, Alaga, Yakap at Oras para sa mga Tagapagtaguyod ng Edukasyon) webinar Episode 5: Healing from Past Hurts and Traumas.  During the webinar, Dr. Alfonso enlightened teachers and non-teaching personnel about trauma –  what it is, how one responds to it, how it affects the brain, and different ways to recover from trauma.  “What happens with trauma is sometimes we think it is just stored in our brain, but it is actually absorbed in our body. It affects our nervous system. Our nervous system goes on hyper-alert. We are experiencing life like it’s not safe. Everywhere we go, we feel like there’s danger kahit wala. That’s because our nervous system was affected by the incident. Ang importante is to be really aware. Ano kaya ang dahilan. Ano kaya ang practices na pwede kong gawin para ‘yung stress ng trauma mawala? It’s really about learning more about the nervous system,” Dr. Alfonso said.  While everyone has their own traumatic experiences, she noted that these have different effects on each individual. Some people recover fast, and some do not.  “We are all experiencing distress differently. What is most critical in our healing process is self-compassion and kindness towards ourselves and others, and a lot of patience—realizing that we are not alone. We can learn from others and their journeys. And that if we take care of ourselves, we will be better equipped to care for others,” she said.  During the ensuing panel discussion facilitated by Raffy Berina from EB Magalona National High School, Dr. Alfonso mentioned that trauma could also affect one’s cognitive ability. If a student is going through trauma, educators can help by practicing a socio-emotional approach. Self-compassion, kindness, and patience towards oneself and others are crucial to recovering from trauma.  “One of the things that is important when working with people who have had traumatic incident is to hold judgment and be compassionate. Second is to let them know nandito lang ako. Sometimes we don’t need to give solutions,” she said.  The speaker left the audience with the ABCD of trauma to guide them in coping with it.  A  –  Ask for help from somebody you trust to build a strong support system.
B – Body doesn’t lie. If your body needs something, pay attention.  Remember that our body and brain can heal.
C – Compassion and patience to ourselves, our loved ones, and those we are working with are key to healing.
D – Dance. Move. Engage in the arts and play. These are the best way to self-regulate, and when you’re consistent, you will see you’re on your way to recovery.
E – Every micro-step we make towards healing is important and worth celebrating.  TAYO Naman! is an online Mental Health and Psychosocial Support program designed to help teachers, non-teaching personnel, and parents learn about self-care, wellness, and resiliency.  The 14-part webinar series is led by the DepEd Disaster Risk Reduction Management Services (DepEd-DRRMS) and the Bureau of Human Resource and Organizational Development-Employee Welfare Division (BHROD-EWD) in collaboration with Globe’s Global Filipino Teachers Series on Psychosocial Support Services, Philippine Mental Health Association and Magis Creative Spaces.  The latest webinar featured panelists from the DepEd Division of Negros Occidental, namely, Angelito Yanson Jr. from Maranon Elementary School, Cinderella Diansin from Minoyan Elementary School, Loje Lingco from Pandan Elementary School, and Riezel Jan Sosas from the Division Office of Negros Occidental.  The next episode on June 25 will be about “Resilience through Positive Psychology: Emerging and Keeping up from Adversities,” to be spearheaded by the DepEd Nueva Ecija Division.  The webinars are held every Friday until August 20 from 8:30 to 10:00 am and streamed live on DepED Philippines, Deped DRRMS, and Globe Bridgecom.

"More master classes, original dance videos: BP aims for world-class status",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/384703/more-master-classes-original-dance-videos-bp-aims-for-world-class-status/,"06:23 PM June 23, 2021","It’s launching its 52nd OnStream season, despite the closure of its home venue After a year of organizing a successful virtual platform, Ballet Philippines (BP) is in a position to push the envelope for its 52nd OnStream season despite the closure of its home ground, the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP). The company has risen above difficult circumstances by providing a vehicle for possibilities via Ballet.ph, a portal to livestreamed classes, videos of old and new works, profiles of company members and a children’s section, among others. BP president Kathleen Liechtenstein said the priority this season is to keep the company in shape with daily online classes conducted by its Russian artistic director Mikhail Martynyuk and American guest artist Joseph Philips. BP will continue to offer free master classes, taught by an international roster of artists, for both company members and dance aficionados. Aside from technique, she said, dancers will learn acting to enhance their performance. Russian film actor, thespian and teacher of stage dance Olga Nasyrova, from Russian Institute of Theater Arts, is scheduled to give one of the master classes. In May, actor Alexei Andreev from Moscow State Pedagogical University taught basic acting in the Stanislavski method, in pure Russian. This famous technique helps the performer create a backstory for the character or role, and deliver a more truthful portrayal. At press time, the season’s repertoire is being developed. Martynyuk is out to prove the company’s mettle in the classics by restaging Marius Petipa’s “Paquita Pas Classique” for video. This is considered a cornerstone of classical ballet, with difficult solo variations and exacting ensemble work. It will be interesting to see how Martynyuk executes it, considering that the original was intended for a cast of 16, with a single danseur. BP’s rendition will be down to its core of 10 dancers, with more males in the corps. Liechtenstein announced that two videos are in the pipeline. One is “Tatlong Pag-Ibig ni Jose (Three Loves of Jose Rizal),” choreographed by Philips. “Rizal’s first love embodied innocence and freshness in the person of Leonor Rivera,” Liechtenstein said. “The second was mature love, as represented by Josephine Bracken. The third one, fatal love, was for his country.” The dance was filmed at Yuchengco Museum, against a backdrop of Rizal memorabilia and photographs. BP is creating a “cultural kit” for its second video in partnership with the fifth district of Manila, which covers Ermita, Intramuros, Malate, San Andres and south Paco. Through dance, Martynyuk is highlighting famous landmarks in these areas. Philips is also choreographing a piece on mental health. At the press launch, he mentioned that BP is exploring the possibility of acquiring works that are performed in major companies. The company is set to participate at an international winter dance festival in Sochi, Russia. The press launch of BP’s 52nd season was more of chest-thumping for its 51st. Last season, BP conducted 365 company classes, which were joined by 6,847 participants. It also organized 52 online master classes, which attracted 1,167 attendants. Ballet stars, such as Vadim Muntagirov of the Royal Ballet and former American Ballet Theater principal Jose Manuel Carreño, plus several international ballet masters, taught pro bono. Early this year, seven certified teachers of Gaga, a movement language based on individual performers’ physical and visceral experiences and imagery, conducted a workshop where recording was not allowed. The teachers are former members of the Israel-based Bathsheva Dance Company led by Ohad Nahrain, progenitor of Gaga. Plans are afoot for a second workshop. Liechtenstein said BP produced 31 original videos to showcase the dancers. The website has uploaded 16. All these videos were produced with partners who helped defray production costs. Asked how BP raised the budget for that, the BP head kept mum about a marketing tack developed to persuade sponsors. The videos were shot in different locations, such as theaters around the city, museums, the Manila House deck and the beach in Calatagan. One of last season’s successful videos, Martynyuk’s “Galvanized House,” will be sent to an international competition, said Liechtenstein. The video shows the relationship between movement and music on one hand, and an unconventional house designed by architect Carlo Calma on the other. Also announced at the launch was the reopening of BP’s Dance School through its virtual program. Classes in different levels—from kindergarten to professional, including adults—will be offered. School director Rhea Bautista said, “While it’s true that there are limits to teaching dance online, it helps us focus on things that truly matter. Students increase understanding of their bodies, breaking down their techniques—and strengthening both these fundamentals.” Ultimately, said Liechtenstein, the goal is for BP to bid for world-class status. “Post-COVID, BP plans to perform outside of the Philippines, and not just focus on Filipino communities. To be looked upon by big companies, you need to dance on the international stage with a repertoire that appeals to international audiences.” —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

Stroem revealed that he was in the “emergency room twice for symptoms of [COVID-19].” “At that time, they did not have swab tests. Since my symptoms were not as harsh, and they [didn’t] have many swabs, they had to send me home. Seems like we understand it more now, but back then… I was SCARED FOR MY LIFE,” he said.

After thanking other who were instrumental in his health journey, he shared that he is also into chelation therapy to remove impurities in his blood. “It was a grueling process, but not IMPOSSIBLE! If you put your mind to it you can move mountains.” he said. “It is never too late to start. You can be 34, and have your dream body… You just have to put in the WERK.” Stroem recently released a single, “Sanity,” where he touched upon the subject of mental health.

A basketball court is a staple in almost every barangay. You can see boys and adult males shooting hoops in open spaces. The game is on television screens and in gadgets. And why not? It does not require much to play it: little space, no maintenance, no expensive gear, no required number of players for a social game. It is the perfect bonding activity for fathers and sons, with the bonus of a good health and great fun. And who best to talk about basketball bonding than the Paras father-and-son tandem, which joins an elite group of two-generation basketball stars.  Ahead of the game Three decades after he joined the PBA, ‘Tower of Power’ Benjie Paras remains the benchmark by which rookies are measured. He holds the distinction of being the only basketball player who received both Rookie of the Year and MVP awards in the same season. He is known for power and grace at ball handing, rebounding, deft mid-range shooting, well-timed blocking and the uncanny ability for inside scoring. In his second month playing professionally, he exploded with 50 points, never allowing the veterans to intimidate him with very physical plays. With such a powerful record, one would imagine the pressure of being the son of a Benjie Paras. How did Benjie make sure his son, Andre, recently drafted by Blackwater Bossing, was spared from such a pressure, especially as the younger Paras started playing basketball in grade school, at the height of his dad’s basketball career? Benjie gives the game away with the following revelations: Fun and games As Andre takes the game professionally starting next month, Benjie’s wise advice is for him to just enjoy the game. “Relax. Follow the play. Have fun. Do not expect anything,” Benjie tells Andre in the special Father’s Day episode of The Good Fit, which starts streaming via SMDC The Good Life on Sunday, June 20.  Benjie reminds Andre how, on his own, the younger Paras developed strong defense skills. When he started amateur basketball, Andre looked at basketball as a side fun activity because he was more interested in his showbiz career then. Benjie tells him it was this attitude that made him excel as he allowed his instincts to take over. “Do not put any pressure on yourself. Just get in there, enjoy the game with your teammates and have fun,” says the father. Enjoy more of these tips, trivia and funny quips from Benjie and Andre via The Good Fit as they do a game showdown at SMDC Field Residences in a month dedicated to fathers. Game On!

We were meant to climb the corporate ladder in school,” reveals Kylie Verzosa as we talk about dreams. It’s all bright lights and crowns the way we see it now. Kylie says it was a little bit more than that. “On my first try, I didn’t win, and that even made me want to try harder. I kept going until I eventually won.” One will quickly discover that Kylie doesn’t let anything get in the way of what she wants. She describes her road to her Binibining Pilipinas International and Miss International 2016 win, “It was every day of just waking up with one thought: ‘I want to win the crown'” Kylie doesn’t just think of it, she goes all in, “I didn’t go out, I didn’t party, I didn’t drink, I didn’t see my friends for a year because I was just so focused. I only had this one chance. I couldn’t screw it up.” Now imagine that hard work and passion as Kylie transforms into a fully-fledged actress. “I’m the type of person who always gives my best at everything.”   A post shared by Lifestyle Inquirer (@lifestyle.inquirer)   How did acting fall into your life plan? 
It was always a childhood dream of mine. It was a secret dream. I wanted to be on TV; I wanted to be in the movies. But I was always told that I was too tall, so I found modeling first. I used to dorm in Ateneo because I’m from Baguio. On my dorm wall, I would stick the magazine photos I liked. I didn’t realize that was my vision board. Do you remember specific photos on that vision board?
Funny, you know, being a beauty queen wasn’t even there. I love the Victoria’s Secret Angels [Laughs]. I was such a big fan of Candice Swanepoel and Miranda Kerr. How do you find the transition from beauty queen to actress? 
In the beginning, it was quite difficult because you built this person; you built this Kylie: a pageant queen. And then the challenge was to take all those walls down, to take all the things you built over the past years, and to show you have the capability to become someone else, and not just to say the lines. Acting isn’t just reading lines. 
In the beginning, I flopped as an actress. When people saw me fail, I felt like people said, “She’s just a beauty queen. She can’t act.” But then again, it pushed me even further. You’re the type that when more people say “No,” the more you’re like “Go.” 
Yes. The more I fail, the more I want to be better. Let’s talk about “Parang Kayo Pero Hindi” with Marco Gumabao and Xian Lim.
I honestly can’t wait to show more of the things I’ve learned now. I believe I get better with every project. My recent project with Marco and Xian, it’s a beautiful story. It’s one of my favorite projects I’ve done so far. It’s a story about complicated relationships. You know the feeling when you’re dating, you’re doing everything that couples do, you’re lovey-dovey, you’re sweet, but ‘di pa rin kayo (you’re still not an item), or it’s very undefined? Neither one of you wants to make the first step, or either one’s not ready. It was very fun but also a bit of a challenge to play, but I enjoyed it. How are Marco and Xian like as your co-stars?
Marco has been my friend since 2016 because we did Los Bastardos together. It’s so much fun working with him. Funny too, because I’m more friends with Marco than Xian. I told the director, “Direk, I think it would work that Xian and I don’t know each other so much as compared to how Marco and I know each other.” It helped with our role. Marco and I were together in a long-term relationship in the miniseries, while Xian and I are a new item. Real-life helped out the script.
It worked! But, taping it, Xian and I got close also. He’s super professional. And we had to tape under quarantine, so we had to be disciplined. We shot for 17 days. I noticed you’re such a fan of your director RC Delos Reyes. Why is that? 
I still consider myself relatively new to the acting industry, so it was different from my past directors when I worked with Direk RC. I was able to talk to him, and he gets me. Some directors would say, “Oh, you’re sad here, sad!” But you can’t really act out what it’s like to be sad when you don’t know why you’re sad. I would call RC an “actor’s director.” He gets the emotion you need from the actor. Did you experience anything similar to the plot of “Parang Kayo Pero Hindi”? 
Yes. For sure. I hated it. I hated walking on eggshells. How did you get out of that? What’s your advice for anyone who is going through that? 
People really need to go through that, I think. That’s why the story is relatable. When I went through that period, I put my foot down. I was very straightforward in finding out what was happening. How did it turn out? 
It turned out good because I knew what I wanted. But if I were also wishy-washy and didn’t know what to do, I would have gotten a different result, maybe. I always say you have to know what you want from a relationship. Do you want a fling? Do you want to get kilig? Do you want to stay with this person forever? Do you want love? Do you want company? Don’t get hurt if the person doesn’t give you what you want when you don’t ask for it in the first place. How do you work on your craft off-camera? 
I do theater workshops, especially during the lockdown. Tomorrow, we have a session. This is how to keep your instrument warm. Is this just a private group? 
It’s a group of private theater people, but Jake [Cuenca] is in it. I do a lot of acting workshops and script reading with a theater coach. I do it twice a week. It’s just reading scripts, but what I found is that theater actors dissect the script in a different way. It’s in-depth and detailed. It’s been a productive year or so, it seems. 
Yes, it was. I had to say, the start of 2020 was a bit hard. It’s cool since before Viva gave me Parang Kayo Pero Hindi, or The Housemaid, I was doing these workshops with my friend. Without even having a sure thing. I just did it because I just really wanted to get better at it. We shot Love Lockdown also. Have you heard of that? Oh, yeah. How was working with Jake Cuenca in that way? 
Working with Jake made me realize I need to get to his level. He’s been in the industry for like 20 years. I’ve learned a lot from him also. What do you have coming up?
I have The Housemaid coming out. It’s an adaptation of a South Korean movie. It’s a psychological thriller. It’s my first lead role in a film, so I’m so nervous. It’s a role I’ve never done before. The original went all the way to Cannes Film Festival, so I have big shoes to fill. My co-stars here are Albert Martinez and Jaclyn Jose. What did you learn from these two powerhouses?
I was just so amazed by them. Miss Jaclyn is straightforward. She tells you, “Parang, di ka magaling dyan (It seems you weren’t so good there),” so you’re always on your toes. You listen to her comments, and it’s even an honor to receive them with her years in the industry. Si Sir Albert, maalaga siya. (Sir Albert is nurturing.) Many dark things are going on in the film, so I learned how they prepare before scenes.  I observed how both of them do breathing exercises. They moved around to get into character. What did you develop in terms of your acting skills through this film? 
I really like this character. It was really so difficult, though. It wasn’t easy because she was not me at all. I even went through my theater coach about it, and she asked me if I’m sure about the role. Let’s talk about Mental Health Matters.  
I started Mental Health Matters because I found that there was a lack of information. This was 2016. There was a lot of misinformation about depression. I was going through my own struggles, and I couldn’t really find any resources about it. And no one was really speaking up about it. There’s also a stigma behind talking about mental health, mental illnesses, depression, and anxiety. I also wanted to shed light on the fact that depression is a real sickness that, if left untreated, can lead to suicide. That was a bit of my advocacy that I believe really needs to be spoken about in public. How difficult was it to go public about this? And not only that but to gather yourself to help others?
It was difficult for me to start because I didn’t really know anyone speaking up about it. When I started to share my story–I felt so scared because it’s such a big part of me. I started a support group on Facebook because I found that I had a really good support system while going through that rough time in my life when I was depressed. And I was thinking: “What about the people who don’t?” When you speak up about what you’re going through, it heals you little by little. What’s the next big thing for Mental Health Matters? 
We partnered up with KonsultaMD. If you text “KYLIEKMD” to 22566002, we’re offering one month free of KonsultaMD. Through this app, you can consult anytime with doctors. What’s the advantage of connecting online with doctors and experts? 
I love online sessions because you can go anonymously–you can turn your camera off. It’s just taking the first step, and that’s one thing that Mental Health Matters advocates. It’s okay to seek help. Let’s normalize going to a psychiatrist. It’s okay to speak to someone about what you need to. It’s normal; it’s even required. What’s one thing you want to tell people who are going through depression?
Depression is a real sickness that needs to be treated for you to get better. I know it takes supreme effort on your end. It takes willpower. It is going to be difficult, but you have to drag your ass out of bed; just take it one day at a time. Brushing your teeth and taking a shower when you’re depressed may be the smallest thing, but that is already a triumph.  Parang Kayo Pero Hindi can be streamed via Vivamax, available on iOS and Android. The Housemaid is set for release later this year by Viva Films.  Photography Andrea Beldua

"For Maxene Magalona, ‘Friends’ can soothe anxiety, cure depression",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/383654/for-maxene-magalona-friends-can-soothe-anxiety-cure-depression/,"05:33 PM May 30, 2021","Actress and yoga instructor Maxene Magalona turned emotional after watching “Friends: The Reunion” starring Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. Magalona spoke about how she thoroughly enjoyed watching the one-time reunion TV special, as can be seen in her Instagram page yesterday, May 29. “May 27, 2021 will forever be etched in my heart. The one where they all got together again for the #FriendsReunion,” Magalona said. “I reminisced about the times when I would binge watch Friends during my college years. Looking back, I thought I was being unproductive by just staying home and watching the show over and over again,” she said, noting that she’s lost count of how many times she has seen the series. “Some people thought I was crazy (and lazy) for not wanting to do anything except watch Friends.” After watching the reunion, Magalona finally realized why she was so hooked on the show.   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Maxene Magalona-Mananquil (@maxenemagalona)  “[It] helped soothe my anxiety and cure my depression. I seriously saw the entire cast as MY own friends. I would even dream about them and imagine as though I was hanging out with them,” she recalled. “The comfort that they brought me was real,” she added. “Even up to this day, I still rewatch all the episodes and laugh just as much as I did the first time. This may sound absurd but it’s true — Friends really helped so many people from all over the world battle their mental health issues. And I am proud to say that I am one of them.” As a fan, she thanked the cast for helping her ease her anxieties in the past. “To my Friends @jenniferaniston, @courteneycoxofficial, @lisakudrow, Matthew Perry, @mleblanc and @_schwim_, I’d like to express my infinite gratitude to you for contributing positive and healing energy to the world. Life just wouldn’t be the same without you,” Magalona said. “Thank you for coming out with the reunion during one of the most difficult and traumatic times we’ve all ever experienced.” “This is something that we’ve been waiting for and it just couldn’t have come at a better time. God bless your kind souls!

‘Working out shouldn’t be optional—make time for it’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/383486/working-out-shouldnt-be-optional-make-time-for-it/,"07:05 PM May 25, 2021","This busy mom works out up to 7 times a week  Pearl Managuelod is a busy, busy woman. The 42-year-old secretary general of the Muaythai Association of the Philippines is also a board member of the Philippine Olympic Committee and executive committee member of the International Federation of Muaythai Associations. She was also appointed deputy chef de mission for the 31st Southeast Asian Games in Vietnam, and just recently joined the National Academy of Sports in the student-athlete support services division. “Plus, I manage my two teenage boys with online schooling and a business on the side,” she told Lifestyle. But she’s never too busy to work out. “It shouldn’t be optional or something we only do when we have the luxury of time. We need to make time for it. It should be as essential as breathing, eating and sleeping.“ Managuelod, who relocated to Nasugbu during the pandemic, works out five to seven times a week. “I’ve been a Batangueño since June. It’s the best decision, since my kids and I are closer to nature, and we get fresh air, the beach and more outdoor time.” She’s been preparing for her next triathlon, as well. “I’m looking forward to my first race in October since 2019—the Ironman 70.3 in Subic Bay.” In this week’s Fitness Diaries, she shares her routine, diet, motivation and other fitness secrets. Have you always been into fitness? It was an on-and-off journey when I was younger, but I didn’t commit to it seriously until 2007 when I had my second son. What inspired your fitness journey? When I gave birth to my second son in October 2008, I fell into postpartum depression. I was also struggling with other mental health issues because my partner and I separated and I had a toddler and a baby to take care of. A friend invited me to try Bikram yoga in 2009 and I was hooked. The overall transformation—physical, mental, emotional, spiritual—I felt were life-changing. Since then, I got into other sports. My fitness routine: I’m into triathlons and marathons, so majority of my workouts are geared toward swimming, cycling and running. I incorporate weightlifting thrice a week. My workouts are normally an hour. A typical week would look like this: Sundays are for long, slow distance. Then Mondays are for recovery so I either do yoga, take longer walks or just go in the pool or Jacuzzi to relax. Tuesdays-Thursdays-Satursdays, weight training; Wednesdays and Saturdays, bike and swim; Friday, running; and then Sundays, bike and run. I walk at least 2 klometers a day, which is convenient because I have to take my dogs out. I take advantage of the nearby beach so I go for open water swims and paddleboard with my sister or kids. Favorite workouts: I love lifting. It’s so empowering, especially when you see muscle definition after. My favorite is leg day, so squats and dead lifts. I also love compound exercises. Given my tight schedule, I get to work out multiple muscle groups in a shorter time. Then for cardio, I love running but not when it’s really hot. Workout frequency: Five to seven days a week if I were to count yoga for recovery. Where do you work out? During COVID, I do my workouts at home and outdoors. I do indoor cycling on my bike trainer because I’m too scared to go on the road alone. Fitness essentials: I cannot live without my running shoes, bike, free weights, TRX, yoga mat and my Garmin watch. For apps, I use Garmin Connect and Sweat. I also subscribed to Zwift for indoor cycling. Also my Therabro massage gun! It’s a lifesaver and the best investment for self-care and recovery! My workout playlist: Eminem, EDM and hard rock. I only use this when I lift, though. When I do indoor cycling, it’s usually a Netflix series or the Zwift app. I prefer running with no music. Just me, my breath and my pain. And enjoying the scenery. My diet: I love to eat and I have a big appetite but I do watch what I eat and try to stick to my macros, depending on my training. I also eat home-cooked meals; buy organic and fresh products; limit processed, sugary, oily foods. I eat as healthy as I can. I used to do intermittent fasting but I’ve plateaued and so I’m back to my normal routine. What I usually eat in a day: Breakfast is usually toast with peanut butter and banana, muesli or cereals with fruits, oatmeal, yogurt, eggs and sometimes protein pancakes. Lunch is a sandwich, fish or meat with veggies, pasta. I snack on yogurt or smoothies or protein shake or toast with peabut butter, dark chocolate, nuts. Then dinner is salad with baked chicken, sandwich, dumplings, seafood, meat or pasta if my workout was heavy. And the occasional steak. Plus, lots of water throughout the day! What’s off-limits: Nothing, really. I eat pretty much everything but in moderation. I’m particular with the nutrition labels of the products I buy. So, low in sugar, low in sodium, no ingredients I can’t pronounce. I follow a very simple rule with nutrition: Eat what you expend. Meaning, match your caloric intake with your level of activity for the day. Do you have cheat days? Yes! I live for cheat days. It’s once a week, usually on a Friday when my kids have their pizza movie night, or Saturday. My happy hour starts at 5 p.m. I eat whatever I want—pastry, ice cream, dessert, burgers (still homemade), chips and alcohol. What keeps me motivated: I have fun when I work out. It’s never a chore for me. It’s already part of my lifestyle. I love the feeling I get after my workout, knowing I’m healthier and stronger with each day. It’s also a great stress reliever at the end of a hard day. I also like going for runs when I need to clear my head. I do my best thinking after a workout. My children are also my motivation. Being a single mom, I have to be a good role model and I want to live a long and healthy life to see them grow up. There are days when I don’t feel like working out, but I take it as my body needing to rest … I don’t beat myself up for missing full workouts so I go for longer walks instead or do a 15-20 minute workout or stretching. I like what Jim Rohn said, that motivation gets you started but it’s discipline that keeps you going. How did the pandemic affect your fitness routine? The biggest challenge was not being able to train with my triathlon team. We used to go cycling in Clark and run at the University of the Philippines every week. Now, I have to train on my own. The pools and gyms were also closed so I had to make adjustments with my home workout routines. I miss the machines at the gym so I make do with free weights, kettlebells and my TRX. There was a time I joined the Ironman virtual races last year but that got old pretty fast. Nothing beats live experiences. Other fitness secrets: I mix up my workouts so it doesn’t get boring. I schedule my workouts at the same time every day. I also buy nice workout clothes so I feel nice when I work out. Tips for people who want to get healthier: Find an activity that you truly enjoy. It’s easier to stick to it when you have fun. A workout buddy can also be helpful so you have someone to push you. Then find classes that you like and fit your schedule. There are so many free classes and workout programs on YouTube and the web. It can be as short as 20 minutes. What’s important is that you’re staying active. And lastly, let’s change our mindset about exercise and working out. It shouldn’t be optional or something we only do when we have the luxury of time. We need to make time for it. It should be as essential as breathing, eating and sleeping. As for nutrition, it’s about mindful eating. Most often, the extra calories we eat are out of boredom or emotional eating. So be more aware of the reasons we reach for those cookies or have that extra serving. When we see food as fuel for our body and sustenance, it will really change our relationship with food.

From track to streets: The cult of fixed-gear bikes,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/383001/from-track-to-streets-the-cult-of-fixed-gear-bikes/,"06:20 PM May 15, 2021","They are popular with younger cyclists because of their affordability, ease of use and low maintenance costs Your speed depends on how much power you generate with your legs combined with the different specs that the bike has, like gear ratios, tire sizes and aerodynamics, which all play an important role in how your bike will function in different environments. The track bike, or more commonly known as the fixed-gear, is a type of bicycle which as the name suggests, has a fixed gear. The bike does not coast and your legs are your brakes. Built for track-racing in velodromes, the fixed-gear evolved and has garnered a huge following of hobbyists, professionals and other creatives. Seeing the most action in city streets, the fixed-gear bike is popular with the younger generation of cyclists because of its affordability, ease of use and low maintenance costs. The bike itself is very minimal compared to road bikes or mountain bikes which need cables and hydraulics among many others, for it to be used properly and effectively. To some, it serves as a form of transportation, to others, a tool to make a living and win championships. Tikboy, an entrepreneur and cofounder of PussyFxd and RektaValenzuela, uses his fixed-gear as his main mode of transportation to deliver products of his brand. The fixed-gear is one of the main reasons he’s able to pay their bills and make ends meet, especially now during the pandemic. “Always wear a helmet and be a defensive rider by using lights during night rides,” Tikboy said. Raffy Magpali, a student and full-time bike messenger, said that the fixed-gear has helped him survive the pandemic by using it as a tool to deliver goods to different places around the metro. “My bike is my main source of income,” he said.JE Itorma, also known in the community as Quacky Wheelie, a professional cyclist and rider for a brand in Quezon City, believes that the fixed-gear has been a big help to him. “My bike helped me love life more especially during the time when I was struggling with my mental health . . . It’s the nature of a fixed-gear—you just have to keep on going, you can’t stop,” Itorma says. Unlike other bikes where you have the option to shift gears while riding, with fixed-gear you’re limited to use a single-gear ratio, which may be a disadvantage to some, as it may be light or heavy depending on the capability and style of riding of the rider. Visual artist Kiko Escora, also known as ManilaAnimal in the community, has collaborated over the years with local brands in putting out new merchandise and bike parts catering to the fixed-gear community. “A lot of people find the fixed-gear braking system inconvenient, when it can actually make riders more mindful of road situations and immediate navigation, thus, being more careful riding,” Escora said. Most individuals didn’t start with the fixed-gear as their first introduction to the bicycle, often starting with the BMX or mountain bike. Riders evolve and develop their taste. But for Theo San Diego, a professional cyclist from Valenzuela City, the fixed-gear was his first bike. “What I really wanted at that time was a road bike but my budget prevented me from getting one,” he said. Now, he is sponsored by multiple brands, and has also competed in international fixed-gear criterium races such as King of Track in South Korea. Giancarlo Maglanque, a freelance graphic illustrator and cofounder of North Side Fixed, started riding fixed due to its simplicity. “It’s perfect for my lifestyle, being a minimalist and an artist—it just represents who I am,” he says. Fixed-gear communities have grown throughout the years as the bike became more and more popular. You’ll find a community of fixed-gear riders in pretty much any city. “I’ve seen it firsthand when my friend got into a serious accident during a tune-up criterium race. We didn’t know where to ask for financial help for the hospital bills. But when I reached out to the fixed-gear community, groups like Manila Fixed Gear, WeFxd, Built Cycles and The Project didn’t hesitate to help . . . The fixed-gear community is solid,” Maglanque said. —CONTRIBUTED INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
What’s for ulam: Filipino love language for community and connections,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/382914/whats-for-ulam-filipino-love-language-for-community-and-connections/,"05:04 PM May 14, 2021","When Filipinos want to greet and check in on someone, they will always ask: “Kumain ka na ba?” It’s a cultural idiosyncrasy that shows just how well-versed Pinoys are in the use of food as a love language – from our pasalubongs and pabaons, to our hating-kapatids and handa for visitors and giant boodle feasts. We nurture and cherish one another through these shared gastronomic experiences. Nothing communicates thoughtfulness and care quite like taking a bite of your favorite ulam, courtesy of your mama, your lolo, your tita, your BFFs. In the Philippines, when we say comfort food, we truly mean it. Giving that comfort to our loved ones is now more important than ever, what with the stress and anxiety brought on by the ongoing lockdown. While the initial shock and fear from the start of the pandemic has somewhat mellowed, most people now report experiencing lingering feelings of dull, dreary numbness. Psychologists call this condition languishing; a state where a person feels drained of vitality and joy—i.e., a serious case of the blahs. While not yet depression, it is the absence of well-being, where you start to feel unfocused, demotivated, and stagnant — and they say it will be the world’s prevailing mood for the rest of the year. While we have no choice but to hunker down in our homes, physically quarantined and cut off from our usual outdoor activities, it is important that we take care not only of our own mental health but the mental health of our loved ones as well. Even our most mundane social interactions are now things to be treasured, and the act of sitting down and sharing a good meal, in particular, has become one of our most meaningful emotional lifelines; a way for us to connect and support one another through these difficult and exhausting times. This sense of community is something GoodAh!!! wants to bring to every gathering, through its Salo-Salo meals. The homegrown food chain store, already popular for its iconic take on the classic lugaw and tapsilog, today boasts an array of viands that would be mainstays in any Pinoy table spread, all put together in convenient bundle sets you can order through delivery and share with your family and friends, hassle-free. There are four different Salo-Salo meals to choose from. Those craving good savory meals can choose between Set A with Pork Ribs, Kare-Kare, and Garlic Kangkong with Pork and Set B with Pork Bistek, Pork Sinigang, and Daing na Bangus. If you want a more celebratory feel, you can also opt for Set C with GoodAh!!!’s signature Herbed Chicken, Pork Liempo, and Pinakbet, or Set D with large Crispy Pata, Beef Nilaga, and Lumpiang Shanghai. Each Salo-Salo set costs less than P1,000, but what’s even better is that GoodAh!!! is currently offering at least 20 percent discount on all of them. So, this is the perfect time to do a customary welfare check on your family and friends, banish those blahs by offering comfort beyond what mere words can express, the way only the best food can. Because for us Pinoys, nothing could be more welcome than a good helping of delicious Kare-Kare, or mouthwatering Crispy Pata, or piping-hot Sinigang to warm the heart. “O, kumusta na kayo? Are you GoodAh?” Goodah!!! is available for 25-hour delivery via GrabFood and Food Panda. Customers can also call its Sucat, Bicutan, Timog, and Granada branches during store hours, and check out their website and Facebook to find out more.

Dress codes are dangerous,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/382592/dress-codes-are-dangerous/,"08:02 PM May 08, 2021","Body-shaming, victim-blaming, misogyny and homophobia can all stem from dress codes Let’s be honest, dress codes suck. The whole idea of dress codes defeats a student’s self-expression, creativity and free will. Let me be clear about a few things. Number one, when I say students should be allowed to wear what they want, I don’t mean clothes that are inappropriate for the school’s environment like bikinis, swimsuits and whatnot. Number two, there should be a certain limit to “wear what they want.” Students should be able to express themselves through their taste and fashion sense without harming the school’s environment. Most of the time, when someone from the school staff sees a girl in ripped jeans and cropped top, they feel the need to pull her aside and tell her that what she’s wearing is “too revealing” or “too distracting.” But when boys unbutton their polo shirts, nobody says anything. Nothing like, “You look messy, button your shirt up.” If anything is said at all, that’s the furthest it can go. One time, my best friend wore a striped overall dress with a jean jacket to school and one of her teachers scolded her for wearing something that showed off too much of her body and skin. A few days after, a slimmer girl wore the same outfit and nobody said a word. “Dress coding” can also be a form of body shaming, which can deeply affect a person’s mental health. When it comes to calling someone too fat, too skinny, too curvy, etc., there are so many ways to go about it. When teachers “dress code” a girl for wearing something that enhances her curves, they say her outfit is “distracting the boys,” but when a skinnier girl wears the exact same thing, nobody bats an eye. The teachers may not even realize that they’re body-shaming. Because of this, the girl’s mental health can get affected immensely—because she isn’t as skinny as others or because she has an hourglass figure. It’s also common for curvier women to be victims of catcalling, which can fuel their anxiety. I’ll say, dress codes can also be used to victim-blame. Whenever a girl gets dress-coded, the excuse is always something like, “The boys will get distracted!” But, come on, ripped jeans and off-shoulder tops? Who’s going to stare at someone’s knees and shoulders and get “distracted”? Girls are made to believe that they have to change their way of expressing themselves because of how the boys feel. It’s messed up to tell a girl to cover up because “the boys in the class will get distracted.” It’s kind of like saying, “it’s your fault for activating their hormones.” Why should the girls have to change the way they dress for the boys’ benefit? Shouldn’t we also teach the boys to have human decency and to keep it in their pants? If you’re going to tell a girl to cover up, you should also teach the guy to show women some respect. Now, this doesn’t necessarily mean that boys aren’t subject to feeling undermined due to dress-coding, because they are.Internalized misogyny According to @impact on Instagram, there was a male student in Texas who wore nail polish to school and got suspended for three days because of it. This goes hand-in-hand with people’s internalized misogyny and homophobia. A lot of schools are against boys dyeing their hair and painting their nails, because it’s “only for girls” or “inappropriate for our environment,” which I honestly never understood. Because of various excuses for dress code, boys are also painted as hormonal monsters who aren’t able to control themselves. Although that happens sometimes, it isn’t the case always. Dress codes can impact all students of all identities. Body-shaming, victim-blaming, misogyny and homophobia can all stem from dress codes, even as people tend to look past it. Girls are made to be perceived as seductresses who wear certain outfits to impress guys. Why can’t we normalize girls wearing outfits for their own benefit? Not all boys are hormonal, disgusting creatures; for those who are, they should be taught to respect women. Dress codes can affect students’ emotional health at such a young age, and because of that, they can grow up in a world of self-doubt and constant self-hatred. Let students wear whatever they want to school. It’ll be beneficial for everyone at the end of the day. —CONTRIBUTED The author is a 15-year-old incoming 10th-grader.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Gifts from the ocean,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/382391/gifts-from-the-ocean/,"05:56 PM May 02, 2021","My nickname “Sea Princess” stems from my immense love of the ocean and all the creatures in it. I formed a deep connection with the ocean over countless years of being a beach lover, but staying by the sea during quarantine further intensified our bond—one that has healed me tremendously. Living in Batangas for weeks has been a perfect way to relax my mind and reduce stress, mental health issues, and all the anxiety brought about by the pandemic. From a purely therapeutic perspective, the healing powers of the sea have several physical and mental benefits. The ocean provides a playing field for everyone to connect with nature and with the deepest parts of our soul. It bombards us with multisensory stimulation: we feel the grains of sand, we taste and smell the salt in the water, the wind rushes over our face and body, we hear the waves crash and feel them caress our skin. It is a complete sensory immersion that nourishes our bodies and leaves us with no choice but to remain in the present. Getting out in nature provides a wonderful escape from negative thoughts. Nature has the ability to positively impact our health, including improving short-term memory, increasing levels of vitamin D, improving sleep quality, decreasing anxiety and depression, reducing inflammation, and even increasing creativity. Current studies suggest that we may need more vitamin D than presently recommended to prevent chronic disease. With summer approaching, many of my friends are reminiscing about their favorite beaches to relax, swim, and get that good vitamin D. Ocean water is significantly higher in minerals, including chloride, sulfate, magnesium and calcium. It can also be highly soothing for skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema. The ocean is one of our planet’s most important resources. It covers 71 percent of the Earth’s surface, provides much of the food we eat, supplies 50 percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere, supports more than 90 percent of the trade between countries by ship, and houses half of the world’s communication cables underwater. Yet just 10 percent has been explored by humanity—and what a beautiful 10 percent it is. It is vital for us to take care of the ocean as much as it takes care of us. In 2020, the European skincare brand Bioten was launched on Philippine shores by Iface Inc. I was delighted to be part of their new campaign, because Bioten puts the environment at the forefront whenever creating or formulating new products for their line. They are known for being a skincare brand that prioritizes sustainability in all efforts, from packaging to the sourcing of materials. They advocate the use of natural ingredients and even place the percentages of each natural ingredient present in their products. Early this year, Bioten launched its Honest By The Numbers campaign, where it engaged three personalities known in their fields to be champions of their respective environmental causes. With Bioten, “caring for nature” becomes more than a brand catchphrase—it is a concrete and honest commitment by the number, together with their partners who do the same. Each environmental champion takes their personal advocacies to heart, and Bioten is there to aid their efforts: Nadine Lustre, actress and singer, who is the brand endorser of Bioten’s Skin Moisture Line; Issa Barte, founder of the youth advocacy group For the Future; and yours truly! Nadine teamed up with Bioten to raise funds for 88,000 trees as part of an effort to reforest the ancestral lands of the Aetas in Yangil, Zambales. The 88,000 trees are representative of the 88 percent ingredients of natural origin found in Nadine’s favored Bioten Skin Moisture Line. Bioten is supporting her efforts by matching the funds raised by Nadine—44,000 worth of seedlings from Nadine and 44,000 seedlings from Bioten. Issa Barte’s organization For the Future (forthefutureph.com) is one of the groups leading the reforestation efforts in Yangil, among many of their other environmental causes. Personally, I have committed to keeping our oceans clean by seeding clams off the coast of Nasugbu, Batangas. Unknown to many, clams are actually a vital part of the sea’s ecosystem. Given the amount of damage and pollution our seas have suffered, clam seeding will go a long way in restoring these ecosystems. For this campaign, Bioten is donating P93,000 to my cause—93,000 being representative of the 93 percent ingredients of natural origin found in my preferred Bioten Hyaluronic Gold line. Check out the wonderful campaign feature at the site metro.com, where it highlights the efforts of Bioten, launched on World Earth Day 2021. The most positive thing that has come out of this pandemic is how our collective “forced pause” has allowed people across the world to see that our wellness depends on the wellness of the planet. Given the state of the world, perhaps there’s never been a better time to “just be”; go hug a tree, listen to the birds chirping outside, feel the fresh breeze on your face—not just to heal ourselves, but to heal our earth. Recognize that without a healthy planet we will not be able to enjoy all these natural gifts given to us. As health and wellness become our deepest treasures, we need to prioritize the collective healing of our planet, as well as the communities within it. In closing, I would like to share the fund-raising project of Assumption College (AC) San Lorenzo ’96. The Silver Batch is proud to present the AC96xHogsmith BACK TO B(AC)ICS apron—a black cotton canvas apron with plaid accents, designed by the girls of AC ’96 in collaboration with Hogsmith Aprons. These limited edition and premium-quality aprons come in two designs (with or without the AC ’96 logo on the front pocket), and are sure to take us all back to our days of preparing pansit, turon and other dishes in our beloved high school cooking lab. Each apron retails for P1,996, or $40, and is available for preorder via Instagram (@acsanlo96) or SMS (c/o Lillian, tel. 0917-5417222 ). They are available for nationwide and international shipping.

Help community pantries from your home,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/382058/help-community-pantries-from-your-home/,"07:53 PM April 24, 2021","As the movement’s mantra goes: ‘Magbigay ayon sa kakayahan’ Just because you’re stuck indoors doesn’t mean you can’t be a part of the beautiful community pantry movement that’s continuing to spread throughout the country, despite intrusion and fears of red-tagging. (Seriously, leave the kind and compassionate alone and let them do what the heartless can’t.) Ana Patricia Non started things with her Maginhawa Community Pantry and you can lend a hand, too. Here are some ways you can help: Donate. There are so many community pantries all over the country that you can give to. There’s also a Facebook group—Community Pantry PH—meant for organizers, donors and advocates of community pantries. You’ll find a database of community pantries there and more specific ways to help. The University of the Philippines Department of Geography, Mental Health AWHEREness, MapBeks and Ministry of Mapping are also working on mapping the community pantries (bit.ly/communitypantrymap)—as of press time, they had mapped 342 pantries, according to Mikko Tamura. You can choose one that’s in your own community. Send over food and basic pandemic necessities—canned goods, rice, noodles, vegetables, fruits, alcohol, masks. As the community pantry mantra goes: “Magbigay ayon sa kakayahan.” Cordillera Landing on You, or CLOY (facebook.com/cordilleralandingonyou), a social enterprise which has been helping local producers, farmers and indigenous communities in Cordillera by buying their products and bringing them to customers in the National Capital Region, has introduced a Pantry Pack. The pack, meant for donating to community pantries, contains a selection of fresh vegetables and is sold at cost for just P100—”no profit, all help,” says CLOY’s Tina Arceo-Dumlao. Cash donations are helpful, too, and with cash donations, you can offer aid to community pantries in other parts of the country. GCash, Paymaya and online bank transfers are easy ways to send money for people to use—and you don’t have to leave your home. Encourage others to donate, too—even the people in your household. People really do want to help, sometimes they just need a nudge. And sometimes they also just need a little help. Maybe your grandparents need a crash course on how to send cashless donations. Maybe your mom needs assistance in booking a rider who can bring canned goods from your kitchen to a community pantry. Do a barkada donation. Turn your upcoming birthday into a chance to give. Share posts and information about community pantries on social media. Not only are these stories of kindness a breath of fresh air, they’re a great way to inspire more people to put up pantries in more communities and to donate—the more pantries there are, the more people could be helped. Seeing acts of generosity has the power to move others to give. INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"Help! I’m a hoarder: Easy, free way to declutter",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/382049/help-im-a-hoarder-easy-free-way-to-declutter/,"07:32 PM April 23, 2021","Humble Sustainability will take anything—good stuff, broken things, electronics, objects that trigger bad memories, literal baggage from exes—and have them reused, recycled or upcycled Humble Sustainability is the hoar­der’s hero. If you are overwhelmed with clutter and don’t know what to do, the startup Humble Sustainability will pick them up for free. There’s no minimum requirement to book a pickup, but founders Niña Mirabueno Opida and Josef Werker recommend pooling them for a single pickup to reduce carbon footprint. They will take anything—good stuff, broken things, electronics, hand-me-downs, objects that trigger bad memories, literal baggage from exes—and have them reused, recycled or upcycled. In an email interview, Opida described Humble Sustainability as “a value-driven marketplace focused on sustainability and circularity.” A “frustrated designer,” Opida and her partner Werker have been advocating sustainability since they met four years ago. Werker is half-Welsh and half-Dutch, and has been living in the Philippines for the past eight years. “Josef’s mother is an environmental activist, and we became fascinated with thrift shops,” she said. The couple did a deep dive into climate change and looked into ways to connect design to sustainability to solve a problem—clutter. “We realized that clutter doesn’t just take up space and waste money, it also damages our planet due to excessive buying and keeping things we don’t use,” Opida said. “Cluttered homes cause mental health issues, which is especially relevant right now as the pandemic has highlighted the importance of mental health and making use of what we have.” Bookings have been regular since they founded Humble Sustainability in 2020, with as many as 250 pickups in a month, Werker said. (See related story on Page C2 on how to book.) The average number of disposed items is 150, but the most they have collected racked up to thousands of pieces and required several trucks! “Humblers” or clients are a mixed lot. “They are businesses, schools and individuals from all sorts of backgrounds,” Opida said. “Anyone who has access to the internet can book a collection, and anyone with clutter is a potential customer.” But how can one practice true sustainability during the quarantine when online shopping is so convenient and addictive? “Stop buying stuff!” Opida said. “Jokes aside, overconsumption means more resources are produced and used. Handle waste properly—reuse, recycle and dispose.” Do these at home, she said: “Unplug phones, switch air-conditioner for an electric fan, turn off TVs and lights.” She added, “Grow your own food! Follow reuse hacks with straws, mugs, bags, water bottles.” Tips are also posted on the Humble Sustainability Facebook page. For fashion, borrow items from family and friends as they might have items used only once. Mend torn pieces before buying more clothes. Look into the new mushroom leather made of mycelium or the vegetative part of the fungus. Sell barely used shoes, bags and accessories. Buy preloved. Opt for reusable facial rounds in using beauty products. For cleaning the home, use hydrogen peroxide and vinegar in a spray bottle alternatively, but never mix them. Sprinkle baking soda on the carpet before vacuuming. Boil together cinnamon, cloves, herbs and fruits and use this as air freshener. Establishments can also offer discounts to shoppers and diners who bring their own bags, cups and containers. Both vegans, the couple also encouraged restaurants to add plant-based items on the menu, to compost food waste and to ditch single-use utensils and packaging. To reduce digital carbon footprint, cut down on email newsletters and delete old Cloud files. Install ad blockers and reduce streaming. Buy secondhand and dispose of gadgets properly. Electronics are one of the most common items collected, along with furniture, books and clothes. Werker recalled that the very first item they got was a box of medicines, and they had to research on how to handle it safely—and legally. The secondhand meds were eventually donated to a local community. “We’ve received saxophones, pianos and some amusing items I cannot even talk about publicly, and you would not believe what people have handed over. Some were in perfect condition!” Humblers give up valuables, too, like jewelry, for a number of reasons—“mental health, helping the planet, creating space,” Werker said. “Minimalist living has been linked to many mental health benefits.” Clients would feel better “after giving back, taking part in social impact initiatives and practicing kindness”—and they have more space. Humble Sustainability has also helped families who had to let go of items owned by the deceased, providing them with comfort during dark times and giving new life to the person’s belongings. Through technology, Humble Sustainability made a decluttering service system that connected recyclers, charities and artists in creating the solution of circular living. Werker defined circular living as “a mentality and a lifestyle in which we extend the life of products in one way or another, a lifestyle that will get us one step closer to a circular economy.” In a year, the founders’ “fierce passion for social impact” proved to be greater than the fear of just the two of them making insignificant changes. “We believe that the ‘I’m just one person’ mentality needs to be shifted to ‘I can make an impact,’” Werker said. “Circular living has the ability to change the world, and it really starts with one small step. Be patient and practice sustainability step by step.” INQ Do you have questions on subjects relating to style, shopping, fashion and beauty?

‘Each household has a front-liner’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/381906/each-household-has-a-front-liner/,"05:59 PM April 18, 2021","Tributes to a sister, a best friend, a mom, K-dramas, students and a beloved pup This week’s personal pandemic heroes: a sister, a best friend, a mom, K-dramas, students and a beloved pup. Each household has assigned one person to be a front-liner. Ours is my sister Hanna, my only sister among seven siblings. Hanna resigned from her job as a social worker at an orphanage, without knowing all this would happen. So she decided to be the family’s front-liner. From managing the monthly finances, going out to the market to buy stuff and then cleaning and sanitizing them to cooking delicious and healthy meals, helping our nephews with their lessons and making sure everyone in the family (especially our nephews) is safe—she’s done it all with flying colors! Now that she’s landed a new job at an NGO (nongovernmental organization), she continues to assist our mom in doing all those things. Our family appreciates and loves her so much for all the things she’s done for us! Props to all the front-liners of every household! —David Soterio San Jose I live by myself but I never feel alone, thanks to my dog, Yoshi. It’s hard not to smile when you look at him! He also does something every day that makes me laugh. I’ve convinced several other friends to get dogs and each of them have thanked me because their dogs have helped them survive the pandemic, too! —Liz Claudio For me it’s not a person. Been drowning myself in K-drama—shallow, feel-good, no-stress K-drama with not much drama like “Strong Woman Do Bong-Soon,” “What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim?” and now I’m rewatching “Goblin” because at least I know how it will turn out and what’s gonna happen next. —Tina Cabanayan I’m a full-time multimedia specialist and a part-time college instructor. Every Saturday, I teach typography and layout to my multimedia arts students at Faith Colleges. So hosting online classes and talking nonstop for an hour (even with their cameras off, making you feel like you’re talking to a concrete wall) is somehow therapeutic for me. You work from home and your only means of communication with your colleagues and friends is through social media. At home, you’re with your family 24/7. So you miss having actual conversations with other people. Having a moment to keep up with others and exchange opinions with them about important matters even once a week somehow makes this social isolation more tolerable. So I want to thank my students for always attending my class, despite the challenges of online learning. You have no idea how relieving it is to speak your mind at times when everything seems routine. —Dexter Balita My mom is my lockdown heroine! After the first few months of last year’s lockdown where she actually spent some time crying, she pulled through with a vengeance. She made sure she kept busy, and the things she does are worth her while. A year shy of 70, she single-handedly planted her own farm-to-table garden that now lets our family harvest veggie ingredients for pinakbet or tinola. She reconnected with her high school friends, learned to put stickers on chats and even post stories na nahihiya ang ka-titahan ko. She used to stick to the classics when cooking, but since the pandemic, she began exploring new cuisines like making her own empanadas and gyoza! Now she’s getting the hang of online ordering. She has taken to personal shopping, too, discovering a kuya rider to get everything she needs from fresh seafood to stuff she likes at S&R. Best of all, no matter that our event place business has closed because of the pandemic, she remains hopeful and faithful that, as many mothers like her would say, this, too, shall pass. Easy to think and feel that this pandemic wreaked havoc on my life, but look, my mom’s been stuck at home for a year and she’s pulled through with a positive outlook. I couldn’t possibly break down when I have a mother who’s shown me courage and resilience through all this, and I have a feeling she’s not stopping! —Ana Felizardo-Mendez My pandemic hero would have to be my best friend Angelique. I remember getting a call from Angelique the minute the lockdown was announced. She already knew that I would be at a loss as to what to do first. She patiently calmed me down and talked me through all of it. Her daily random memes/Twitter finds are her attempts to keep the situation a little lighter. She made sure that we remained in touch every day to update each other on our physical and mental health. There were also moments when she did not need to say or do anything to show me that she was there. When my dad had a heart attack and I shut everyone out, she knew how to be there for me from a distance. She let me deal with it in my own way and never forced me to talk to her or open up. My dad eventually recovered and when I felt ready to talk to people again, she was the first person I called. She picked up on the first ring, and no questions asked, she just listened to me. Angelique has been saving me even before this pandemic and more so now. I wouldn’t be able to go through all of this without her. —KZ Macam INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
This super mom lifts weights—including her toddler,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/381655/this-super-mom-lifts-weights-including-her-toddler/,"07:37 PM April 13, 2021","Even a crushed ankle couldn’t stop Niña Defensor from moving Niña Defensor has always been athletic. But the single mom said her real fitness journey began after she gave birth to her daughter four-and-a-half years ago. “What served as the catalyst for this journey was when I put everything I had into being able to relactate after two months of losing my breast milk due to stress at work,” she said. “I realized I could create significant changes in my body as long as I was consistent.” That was also when she started meditating. “It has done wonders for my mental health because God knows so much s–t went down during that period.” Defensor said practicing meditation every day allowed her to stay focused in all aspects of her life. “I trained to be a fitness coach at a well-known fitness studio, joined a dragon boat team and just made it a point to move every single day, and loved every moment of it.” Defensor, who owns the barber and tattoo shop Qubo Manila (@qubomnl) where she does permanent makeup, said, “Since the pandemic began, the foot traffic in our barber and tattoo shop has come almost to a complete halt. I’ve had to put my cosmetic tattoo clients on hold, but it has given me more time to deepen my meditation practice, explore my artistic capabilities and focus on being a more present single mom.” And she’s also spent time exercising, of course.When lockdown started in March 2020, Defensor was working out every day. “I did my own workout programs, attended HIIT Pilates classes by my friend Premyer Tamayo on Zoom as much as I could, and most of those times, I had my 4-year-old, who would serve as my weights.” But halfway into 2020, she crushed her ankle. “I needed immediate surgery to reconstruct my ankle with metal plates and screws on either side of my right foot.” She spent the first couple of months of 2021 learning how to walk again. But this super mom is determined not to let that setback keep her from her active lifestyle. “I’ve just gone back to working out with a little bit more intensity, and I couldn’t be more ecstatic about that.” My favorite workouts and exercises: I love lifting weights. So since I have not been able to hit the gym, I do body weight training at home using a pair of dumbbells, resistance bands, and my 4-year-old. (Laughs)Workout frequency: I am back to working out three to four times a week. I used to work out six days a week when I would teach at Saddlerow as a rowing and circuit coach and do other workouts outside of my classes. My fitness must-haves: A good playlist is top priority! I’ve also invested in good workout clothes. A good sports bra and compression tights are very important to me. I mix Xtend BCAAS in my workout tumbler as well and, when I lift, I take my whey protein. I explore different brands with that one. My workout playlist: My playlists vary according to my mood, of course, so it could range from ’80s, ’90s guilty pleasures to bubblegum pop to grunge and metal. Of course, I have my OPM playlist, too, and that has Razorback, Greyhounds, Wolfgang, as you would know! (Laughs)Do you stick to a strict diet? I never really had a strict diet. It was more of a mindset shift for me. I wouldn’t deprive myself, I’d have it all in moderation. However, the lack of movement during the healing from my surgery caused me to step it up a notch so I’ve been staying away from processed food now and limiting my sugar intake. Tips for people who want to get healthier: Enjoy the journey. Don’t obsess over the outcome. When you are grateful for movement and health every day, you get to your destination much quicker than expected. INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Annual fecal test key to early detection of colon cancer,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/381652/annual-fecal-test-key-to-early-detection-of-colon-cancer/,"07:33 PM April 13, 2021","The pandemic has severely affected screening of the third most common cancer among Filipinos Colorectal cancer (CRC), a malignancy of the large intestine, is the third most common cancer among Filipinos. More than 17,000 Filipinos were estimated by Globocan to have been diagnosed with cancer in the colon or rectum in 2020. Around 10,000 persons were also estimated to have died from the disease last year, despite it being one of the most treatable and preventable cancers. CRC is a preventable disease, as screening can prevent this cancer through the removal of precancerous lesions via a procedure called a colonoscopy. Thus, it can reduce death through early detection and treatment of cancer. The fight against colon cancer has been a very challenging battle in the Philippines. There is no national population-based CRC screening program in the country. The plans on prevention and early detection initiatives for CRC by the Department of Health (DOH) under the National Integrated Cancer Control Act (Nicca) has yet to be formulated and was further halted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has severely challenged the provision of routine health care, including screening of CRC. What is alarming is that this interruption has resulted in a delayed diagnosis of colon cancer, possibly in a more advanced stage. As the lead advocate of the CRC screening campaign of The Medical City, I recently initiated a forum in collaboration with Kaiser Permanente (KP), an American integrated health-care consortium and the largest nonprofit health-care plan. The webinar was titled “Colorectal Cancer Screening: Best Practices and Challenges of a Cancer Screening during the Pandemic and Beyond.” KP’s cancer screening programs are probably America’s best, if not one of the world’s best programs. Its quality of care has been highly rated around the world, and this is attributed to its strong emphasis on preventive care. Their best practices on CRC screening was the subject of the lecture of Dr. Theodore Robert Levin, the clinical lead for CRC screening at KP Northern California. It was timely as the implementation of Nicca aims to expand the health benefits of Filipinos to include screening and prevention of cancer. According to Levin, KP Northern California implemented an organized CRC screening, consisting of a direct-to-patient annual mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) outreach to eligible patients in a large community-based population in 2006. Opportunistic colonoscopy was allowed as a screening option by request. Levin published their results in 2018 and demonstrated that the implementation of such program rapidly increased the participation of patients and the up-to-date status of screening from 38.9 percent in 2000 to 82.7 percent in 2015 (as compared to 66 percent nationally in the United States). The higher rates of screening were associated with a 25.5-percent reduction in annual colorectal cancer incidence from 2000 to 2015, and a 52.4-percent reduction in cancer mortality. During the pandemic in America, KP’s program was stopped for three months, but they were able to rapidly resume the FIT outreach due to numerous employed strategies. The FIT outreach is particularly relevant due to limitations in access to colonoscopy and population fears of in-person visits because of COVID-19. Dr. Eric Tayag of the DOH talked about “Recalibrating Nicca Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic.” Filipino patients have developed increasing mortality and morbidity, worsening mental health status, a big decrease in provider visits, and declining health services coverage, he said. The good news is that the government has budgeted a total of P620 million for Nicca and cancer assistance fund. Tayag recommended complementing the care given at cancer centers with telemedicine during the pandemic. Gastroenterologists and other physicians should promote the option of using FIT as a screening option among our patients. Filipino patients are still worried about the potential risks of transmission during endoscopic procedures, and their dwindling financial resources. The FIT test may be used to stratify patients as to who needs the colonoscopy more urgently than others, given the limited health resources of our country. When the DOH plans a population-based screening program in the future, this can result in diagnosing cancers in the earlier stages when these can be effectively treated and lead to an eventual decrease in mortality. When asked what would be his advice to Philippine health policy makers on starting a CRC screening program, Levin said “to start small based on your resources, use the FIT, build from there, and prove your concept.” We can hope that once this pandemic is over, screening measures to prevent CRC in the country can be finally realized. —CONTRIBUTED INQ The author is a Philippine and American board-certified gastroenterologist and lead advocate for CRC screening of The Medical City.

"Our personal pandemic heroes: ‘My companions, problem solvers, painkillers’",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380439/our-personal-pandemic-heroes-my-companions-problem-solvers-painkillers/,"06:26 PM March 15, 2021","In our continuing series, we bring you more stories about personal pandemic heroes—those who made other people’s lockdown lives easier, happier. The start of the lockdown brought a lot of uncertainty and I felt the need for a comforting, reassuring and supportive voice—someone who could make sense of what was happening. I found that in Fr. Domie Guzman, the parish priest of Our Lady of Sorrows in Pasay City. As a forward thinker and a man of action, he immediately set up the daily and Sunday online Masses of his parish for the benefit of his community, and luckily even those outside. Hearing daily Mass became part of my quarantine life, and Father Domie’s homilies are always inspired. They were not just insights into the scriptures, but motivations to live a purposeful life. It helps that Father Domie is an engaging, passionate and gifted speaker. —Abbey Tomas My sons Kubing and Kunta have helped me a lot during the enhanced community quarantine. Both of them were responsible for setting the table for every meal, cleaning up and washing the dishes. They also feed the dogs and take the garbage out every night. They even cook for us sometimes. Our family doesn’t have household help during the pandemic and we maintain a huge area. My boys have been very helpful and don’t complain when asked to do chores despite also being busy with their online classes. —Maan Chua My family helps make lockdown and pandemic life easy. They’re my companions, problem solvers, entertainment system, painkillers. Spiritual teachers. All of the above. They help keep me sane. They are artists, too, in their own way, follow them on Instagram: @levitation_studio, @_interstellayt_ and @washimachine_mnl. This is a big shoutout to my family, my wife Ge, my son Vito and daughter Estella. Love you! —Diego Mapa My kids Cash and Carrie made my pandemic life a little easier and happier. We got to spend a lot of time together. —Nikko Lim Pandemic life has been quite crazy, especially as we’ve been in it for a year now. Two things that I struggled with were managing my anxieties and staying hopeful and optimistic about meeting my personal goals. I have to thank my good friend Luigi Cortez for the random check-ins because it really helps having a friend who’d go out of his way to do that. Even now that he’s on another side of the world pursuing his MBA (Master of Business Administration) and we’re in different time zones, he never fails to make time for our random catch-ups. The mere fact that he’s pursuing his MBA in the time of COVID has really inspired me and made me believe that pursuing goals shouldn’t be stopped by the pandemic. —Macky del Rosario Some of the most effective pandemic heroes are the ones we see within the four sides of our computer screen. After randomly attending online Sunday masses, I found Fr. Jerry Orbos again on Facebook—again, because he would occasionally say Mass in the condominium where I stayed. Father Jerry has the God-given ability to lift his listeners’ spirits; other than his occasional jokes and ingenious acronyms, his deep insights and assurances of God’s love have been absolute lifesavers in times of isolation. “It is better to be presumptuous of God’s love than to ever doubt it,” he said. “Kapal-muks na lang kami, Lord.” He never turns political, threatening, or judgmental; this cancer survivor generates pure positivity and is a living, breathing messenger of divine compassion, in my book. He also runs a foundation that supports retired missionaries of the Society of the Divine Word, the order he belongs to. Once, in sheer gratitude, and since he has been locked down in the Divine Word Seminary since the pandemic started, I sent him some vitamin C as a selfish investment in keeping him healthy. He texted back, “I need Vitamin P, too—prayers!” From the comments during Mass, it’s obvious I’m not the only one Father Jerry is keeping afloat during this time, and I thank God so much for him. —Alya B. Honasan I am so grateful for my three girls. My loves, my life. My amazing wife who has become a homeschool teacher, psychiatrist, fitness instructor, handyman, yaya referee, entertainment director, master chef and guidance counselor, among other things. And my two kids who are my daily happy pills. —GP Reyes As a food lover who has been keeping a Facebook food page since 2012, the start of the community quarantine a year ago posed many challenges as it meant that I could no longer dine out and try different restaurants. That’s my hobby, a way to entertain myself while being a housewife who does all the housework. Also, where would I buy our family’s food supplies given the quarantine restrictions? Thankfully, my husband Caloy introduced me to an online food community, which was set up on Facebook for our neighborhood, and it’s where we can shop for all sorts of food items that we need or want. From eggs, fresh seafood, meat, fresh vegetables and fruits to home-cooked meals, restaurant dishes, cakes, ice cream, cookies, wagyu cubes—almost everything is available for delivery in our area. The group is now almost 10,000-strong, with food purveyors from neighboring villages joining in. The convenience of ordering food online without ever having to step out of the house is really something to be thankful for. Not only does it make our lives a lot easier during this very unusual time, but we also get to help our neighbors and small business owners earn a little income during this pandemic. I’ve discovered an abundance of food options and a wealth of good home cooks and talented home bakers within our community, and therefore have not skipped a day of posting on my food page. I’ve also met many wonderful neighbors because of it. One of them is Armand Bicaldo, a home cook who makes our family’s now favorite crispy adobo flakes. He followed my food page, and when he saw that I made jars of acharang labanos (pickled radish) for my teenage daughter, he offered to trade his Ilonggo-style beef tapa (also known as kusahos) for it. Not a fair trade, I know, but he insisted and so the food exchange was made. We both enjoyed what we got and it’s really a testament to how food can bring people together. Before the New Year, he sent me a scrumptious apple pie as a “thank you” gift for being a regular customer. These little things have made my quarantine life a lot easier and a little interesting. —Joy Cruz The pandemic made me realize that the world can just stop, in a snap. On March 12, 2020, I left Bonifacio Global City and went back to our Quezon City family home. What a year it has been! It has made me aware, that in times of uncertainty, we all go back to basics. Amid anxiety and stress, I have one hero who got me going. It is my nephew Andrei Christopher. Andrei was my little torch of light in these dark times. He made me realize that the innocence of a child is a beacon of hope. Viewing things through a child’s eyes is a reminder to live simply. He was so happy when the pandemic kept the family home every day. Isn’t family the most important thing, after all? I thank Andrei for his wild imagination, cutest antics and fun trivia, his “Tita, do you know?” moments. He saved me a hundred times, when the world was so dark and filled with negativity. My pandemic hero is someone who doesn’t even realize at his young age that he saved me from all this madness. —Maui Pere I want to share about my husband Brandz, who lost his job during the pandemic. He has been an amazing partner and has made this difficult time a breeze just by being so supportive and helpful with house chores and helping me take care of the kids. He makes us over-the-top, resto-quality dishes every day and he just enjoys serving us and making us happy. He has always been an amazing husband and dad, but I am so happy to have him home more because his presence makes everything light and wonderful! He also has a very positive outlook that has been really helpful amidst all the bad news we were receiving last year. Also, I see him constantly trying to become a better parent to David, our newly adopted son. It hasn’t been easy, but having him around has made everything better and has reminded me that we can get through anything! Not only that, he also started a food delivery business and has also built a commissary kitchen to help expand his business. I am really grateful for him, and he is such a hero to me and to the kids! He is the best. —Trix Clasara My wife, Kim, has really made this pandemic more tolerable for our family through her cooking. Since dining out isn’t an option for us anymore, she always makes an effort to learn and cook new and special dishes for us on the weekends. The kids now just request for their favorite restaurant food from their mom! —Paulo Rodriguez I was in the events and advertising industry for more than 15 years, and I played music gigs for 17. This pandemic turned my life upside down, as the industry that gave me my livelihood was badly hit by this nightmare. Our company closed down and I lost my job. It’s been a year now since I played my last gig. My mental health was fragile. I was always anxious and uncomfortable. I made myself feel better by taking pictures of sunsets every single day. It was also my prayer time. It was therapeutic, until reality punched me in the face again. Uncertainties. After a few months, I got to reconnect with an old friend, Charmy Buan. I call her Bing. I met her in the oddest of ways. In 2016, the car she was driving hit me. She brought me to the hospital and took care of me, making sure that I was okay. Her kindness meant a lot to me. That’s how we became friends. She attended a few of my gigs and I was always happy to see her in the crowd. While we weren’t always in touch, we kept tabs on each other. One fateful day, we got to talk again, and Bing invited me to attend a career preview. I grabbed the opportunity to learn about the business that made her successful. It was interesting to me, so I put in the work. It’s been a few months, and I am now a financial advisor. This changed the game for me. Bing picked me up from being in a slump, drowning in uncertainties. I knew from the start that she was a good person, but seeing what a great leader she is has been such a pleasant surprise. She is inspiring. Her heart and mission to help others makes her a hero to all of us, the team she leads. Through her mentorship, she has built an unshakable team. Soon, she will be promoted from a unit manager to a branch manager, and this victory is one that she truly deserves. Hats off to my pandemic hero, president Charisma Buan of Double Dragon Life Insurance Agency. I am truly grateful for the opportunity she has given me to defy odds and be a better version of myself in the weirdest of times. My hero, my president, and my friend.—Honey Machuca My pandemic heroes are my client- bosses from Foodpanda and Ayala Malls. Most of my agency’s projects and events were put on hold due to the pandemic. But I am very thankful for Foodpanda and Ayala Malls for giving us projects despite the pandemic. We survived 2020 because of the projects they entrusted to us. I am so grateful to them. I wish our fellow agencies would also recover the soonest.

Why traveling now is for your sanity,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380417/why-traveling-now-is-for-your-sanity/,"05:24 PM March 15, 2021","The healing huts of Siquijor, dive spots and cultural hive of Negros, and heritage sites of Bataan and Intramuros await to soothe troubled minds Some people go to the spa for a day of relaxation and pampering. I went to a healing hut in Siquijor where, in a ritual, a healer walked around me blowing bubbles into a jar of water with a black stone. The water turned cloudy, full of the toxins that were supposedly removed from my body. I must admit that I did feel a sense of healing and catharsis after that treatment. An entire year of the pandemic has taken its toll on our bodies, and whether or not we feel physically sick, I know that the fear, anxiety and stress of living with COVID-19 are lodged deep inside us. That is why it was no surprise that when the results of the Department of Tourism’s recent travel survey came out, the No. 1 reason people gave for traveling domestically, even during the midst of the pandemic, was for their sanity. Call it mental health, therapy or self-care—traveling is widely seen as a panacea for the troubles of the mind and soul. Siquijor will reopen to tourism this month in time for its annual Healing Festival, which happens during Holy Week both for practical and magical reasons. Even if potions are not your cup of tea, the island has a lot of natural ways to put you under its spell. There are also several other cultural spots around the Philippines that are now open, quick getaways where you can shake off the cobwebs of the quarantine and experience something wonderful and new. Siquijor is also just a ferry ride from Dumaguete, where I indulged in the culinary scene of Negros Oriental’s capital, starting with a breakfast of budbud and sikwate at the painitan of the public market. I also checked out “Atoa,” an exhibit of local artists at the Dakong Balay, a restored heritage house-turned-art gallery. Dumaguete happens to be a cycling haven, and those who dive will be thrilled to hear that the dive sites around Dauin have also been reopened. It was a weekend of healing on all fronts, and I will never underestimate how a simple dish of sticky rice dipped in chocolate and paired with mangoes can be so soothing. In January, I went to Bacolod to assess the readiness of Negros Occidental in opening its tourism destinations. It was my first official trip to the province since I became tourism secretary, so you can imagine how excited I was to sample its heritage cuisine and explore the province’s many heritage structures that take you back in time. I was stunned speechless by the Ruins, whose romantic and tragic backstory will move you to tears. I was also impressed by the restoration of the Balay ni Tana Dicang, an original and intact bahay na bato dating to 1883, owned by the sugar baroness Enrica Alunan Lizares, Negros’ original boss kween. Bacolod is also a cultural hive of modern art and design, and I spent hours soaking in the creativity of the Art District dedicated to homegrown contemporary art. Charlie Co’s Orange Project, the first professional gallery in the province, continues to be influential in developing the Negros art scene. Among the many galleries, artist-run shops, cafés and tattoo parlors in one spacious compound, you could spend a whole day finding inspiration and feeling invigorated by the display of Filipino creativity. If heritage architecture is your fancy, then a trip to Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar in Bataan should be moved to the top of your domestic bucket list. A resort like no other, the meticulously restored and ornately decorated mansions also function as hotels you can stay in to experience that colonial-luxe life of a reimagined Old Manila. Each casa, which owner Jerry Acuzar acquired from various locations around the country, is a witness to history and has its own rich tale of intrigue. Visitors can take a guided cultural day tour, which includes—check this out—a Venetian gondola-inspired balsa ride through its waterways. Lastly, I am inviting everyone to visit or revisit Intramuros, which was opened to the public on Feb. 17. There I discovered a new hobby, or shall I say rediscovered an old one, when I went on a guided Bambike tour of the Walled City. Intramuros, which won Asia’s Leading Tourist Attraction at the World Travel Awards 2020, is more than a heritage site and historical attraction to Filipinos, but the soul of Manila and a living place which we should all make part of our lives. One of Intramuros’ reopened attractions is the Casa Manila Museum. The temporary closure allowed for the redesigning and transformation by architect J. Anton Mendoza, who lent his skills and talents for free. Decluttered and rearranged, the once dark and dreary Casa Manila is now bright and elegant. All these places I mentioned are open to tourists in compliance with health and safety protocols. While we encourage people to travel locally to help revive the tourism industry—and maintain their sanity—this will only work if everyone commits to wearing their masks and shields, maintaining proper hygiene, reducing contact by using contactless apps, and keeping their distance. So, go out there and try something new, like riding a bike, or learn something old in our heritage sites, and you’ll discover the many different ways we can heal ourselves through this pandemic. —CONTRIBUTED INQ The author is the tourism secretary.

Gynecomastia: Living with man-boobs,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380389/gynecomastia-living-with-man-boobs/,"04:42 PM March 15, 2021","Men and women alike take pride in how other people appreciate and perceive them. Our physical appearance and attributes usually boost our confidence, and undeniably affect our personality. In a world where everyone wants to be in the limelight, whether on the big screen or just on social media, most of us are now more adventurous, willing to take risks and willing to be under the scrutiny of other people through different social media platforms. But what if you are a man with breasts bigger than the breasts of the women you know? Will you still be willing to post photos and videos of yourself on social media? In a society where manhood and virility is usually defined by a well-built physique with six-pack abs, well-defined triceps, and biceps, living with man-boobs can bring your spirit down. Most people are not aware that man boobs or gynecomastia is a common condition wherein men’s breasts tissue swell or overdevelop and become larger than normal. This can occur at any age, however, most cases of gynecomastia, occur during puberty and may persist until adulthood. According to a board-certified surgeon who has been known in the industry for specializing in gynecomastia surgery Dr. Vicente Firmalo, many Filipino males suffer from gynecomastia and most males who have this condition are really looking for a way to rid of their big breasts. “Men and women both have breast tissue but usually in smaller amounts in men,” Firmalo said. The American Society of Plastic Surgeon says that gynecomastia happens due to several factors such as hormonal changes, heredity, obesity, or the use of certain drugs, and it is often characterized by excess fat, excess glandular tissue development, sometimes excess breast skin, and may appear on one breast or both breasts. “We all know that men produce a hormone called testosterone while female hormone is called estrogen. Males also produce a small amount of estrogen. These hormones steer sexual growth in boys and girls. When there is an imbalance in the production of these hormones, it can affect their growth. For example, when a male produces less testosterone, and more estrogen, this causes male breast tissue to swell during pubertal years,” Firmalo explained. “From almost over 300 gynecomastia surgeries I have done since I became a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, the most common signs and symptoms are: a lump of firm tissue under the nipple or whole breast in one or both sides, tenderness or puffy areola. Sometimes, there is discomfort due to tenderness and sometimes there is discharge from the nipple. Another sign could be increased diameter of the areola,” Dr. Vice explained while adding, “If you have these signs and symptoms, it is best to have an appointment with a doctor to rule out signs of other illnesses such as cancer and can help you with the right treatment and procedure for your condition.” Aside from obvious signs and symptoms, he also pointed out that gynecomastia can also impact one’s mental health. “Those who have decided to correct gynecomastia through surgery are not just fixing their physical appearance but it is also their way to improve their mental health since this condition can make the sufferer feel embarrassed, depressed or anxious. Some of my patients were bullied because of their gynecomastia, they became the laughing stock in their groups or even in the family.” Firmalo shared that because gynecomastia usually starts during pubertal years in a man’s life, some patients really experience bullying. “Peers or people in the community would tease them and they (patients) may seem okay with it but they may be suffering inside – feeling sorry, insecure, anxious among other emotions.” “Gynecomastia in general, is usually a harmless medical condition but it can trigger depression and anxiety especially if you are being bullied for having it,” Firmalo said. Most cases of gynecomastia can be addressed through surgical procedures. “Some chests increase in size from weight gain and I usually recommend regular exercise to decrease the fat in their chest. This will help see which is the gynecomastia. To those who have hormonal imbalance, they will also have to see an endocrinologist. However, when the hormones have become normal, this is not an assurance or guarantee that the gynecomastia or gland will vanish, some will achieve their desired results, but not everyone will respond to hormonal treatments. In this case, if they are willing to go under the knife and their gynecomastia is causing them pain or distress, we can fix this through surgery The surgeon also stressed that it is important to only consult with board-certified plastic surgeons and the patients should also be careful in choosing their doctors. “It is also best to know your surgeon and his experiences in doing the procedure, the number of gynecomastia surgery he’s done, and what sort of follow-up a patient should do after the surgery.” According to Firmalo, gynecomastia surgery or male breast reduction might involve liposuction to rid of the fats, removal of excess tissues, and areola reduction. “The surgery will take around a couple of hours and the patient can be discharged from the center the same day.” Full recovery, however, Dr. Vice shared, might take between 4 to 6 months up to a year and patients are advised to refrain from doing strenuous activities and proper hygiene and wound care should be observed. A calendar of allowable activities should also be discussed with your surgeon and gradual progression to heavy activities. Gynecomastia may be a common condition among teenage boys and older men, and sometimes even we can become insensitive when we tease them about their condition, according to Firmalo, “They suffer in silence from the bashing, teasing and bullying and these affect their mental health, so let’s be sensitive and encourage them to address their condition.” Dr. Vicente Firmalo is a Fellow of the Philippine Association of Plastic, Reconstructive, and Aesthetic Surgeons (PAPRAS); Diplomate, Philippine Board of Plastic Surgery; International Member, American Society of Plastic Surgeons; Member, International Society of Plastic and Regenerative Surgeons (ISPRES); and Volunteer Surgeon, Smile Train and Operation Smile.

Royal family contests Harry and Meghan’s racism claims,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380230/royal-family-contests-harry-and-meghans-racism-claims/,"12:05 PM March 11, 2021","LONDON — Britain’s royal family has begun a fight back against racism claims made by Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, indicating the couple’s comments will not go unchallenged as the country divides into partisan camps. A keenly awaited statement from Queen Elizabeth II issued Tuesday was conciliatory towards her grandson and his mixed-race spouse, after their explosive interview with US chat show host Oprah Winfrey. But it also stressed that “some recollections may vary”, as Buckingham Palace vowed to look into the couple’s assertion that an unidentified royal had asked how dark their unborn son Archie’s skin would be. The row is being watched worldwide, in the United States where the couple now live and across the multi-racial Commonwealth, which the queen heads, dragging Britain’s most famous family further into a debate about racism and the country’s colonial past. The UK government is refusing to get involved in the family’s biggest crisis since the very public collapse of the marriage of Harry’s parents, other than to praise Elizabeth’s stewardship of the country and the 54-nation Commonwealth. But pointedly, Downing Street has declined to disown remarks by junior foreign minister Zac Goldsmith, a close ally of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who accused former army captain Harry of “blowing up his family”. Senior minister Jacob Rees-Mogg denied there were any wider ramifications for the 94-year-old queen, who has reigned over Britain and 15 Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada since 1952. “She has done her duty. I think she is loved across her realms for that,” Rees-Mogg said. “And I don’t think interviews with chat show hosts in the United States makes a great deal of difference to that.” Constitutional expert Robert Hazell, from University College London, also said it was likely the royals would weather the storm. “It would only become a crisis for the institution if opinion polls began to show that it had significantly reduced support for the monarchy,” he told AFP. However, Australia’s pro-republican former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the allegations should pave the way towards his country holding another referendum on abolishing the monarchy. “The bottom line is that in Australia the scandals, the personalities, the dramas of the royal family are not really the issue,” he told Britain’s ITV, which aired the Winfrey interview on Monday to an audience of more than 11 million. “The issue is that Australia’s head of state should be an Australian citizen chosen by Australians, not the king or queen of the UK.” US network CBS, which first broadcast Winfrey’s interview on Sunday, said close to 50 million people had watched worldwide, and the figure would rise as more territories air it. Winfrey said the racist remark did not come from either the queen or her 99-year-old husband Prince Philip, who is in hospital with a heart condition. The queen’s statement said the charge of racism was “concerning” and would be “taken very seriously”, but added that it would be “addressed by the family privately”. The Daily Telegraph newspaper said that in noting that people’s memories may diverge, the palace statement suggested that the person behind the remark about Archie’s skin tone may already have been identified. It said the public were unlikely to learn more, as this was “expected to be Her Majesty’s final word on the matter”. But The Sun newspaper said the queen was to investigate further through “private conversations” with senior royals including Harry’s father Prince Charles, her oldest son and heir, and Harry’s elder brother William. Former royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the 61-word statement was “the bare minimum”, at a time when the royals find themselves in an “enormous hole”. “In my judgement, it was too little and it was too late,” he told BBC radio. Charles has yet to comment, but on Tuesday was filmed touring a Nigerian Christian church in London whose pastors are promoting a drive to vaccinate more black people against the coronavirus. One of Meghan’s complaints was that she had suicidal thoughts during her time in Britain, but received no support, provoking fresh debate about the royal family’s ability to connect with ordinary people. It was later reported that she complained about former CNN host Piers Morgan’s criticism of her mental health struggles to his employers ITV, prompting him to quit as the channel’s flagship breakfast show host after refusing to apologize. A defiant Morgan said Wednesday: “I don’t believe almost anything that comes out of her mouth.” A YouGov poll of 4,656 people after the interview aired in Britain indicated almost a third (32 percent) felt the couple was unfairly treated — the same proportion as those who thought the opposite. Opinions diverged along lines of party affiliation and age, mirroring the fissures that have opened up in Britain since the 2016 vote to leave the European Union. Younger people and opposition Labour supporters were more favorable to Harry and Meghan. Older respondents and Conservatives took the royal family’s side.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.

5 women who inspire and empower other women online and in the real world,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380079/5-women-who-inspire-and-empower-other-women-online-and-in-the-real-world/,"03:52 PM March 08, 2021","Manila, Philippines – March 5, 2021 – TikTok takes pride in being a positive and inclusive platform, where women are empowered to express themselves creatively and authentically. Female creators on the app have helped transform TikTok into a real, inspiring, fun, and educational space for all, and they continue to do so each time they share creative new content.   Antoinette Taus (@antoinettetaus) Filipino-American actress, humanitarian, and Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Environment Programme, Antointette Taus, is a long-time fixture in the local entertainment industry. Recognized as one of the most influential role models of the youth of her generation, Antoinette’s main mission is to empower the youth to take the lead in the transition toward a future that is centered on the betterment of people and the planet—without leaving anyone behind. She founded the non-profit organization “CORA” (Communities Organized for Resource Allocation) and the purpose-driven business “The Sustainable Planet”, which are dedicated to creating sustainable programs and solutions to help solve global issues focused on hunger, poverty, inequality, mental health, plastic pollution, and climate change. For Antoinette, in order to be supportive of other women, you must first be kind. “Uplifting each other, being kind to each other, not judging each other. Just imagine, you don’t even have to look for support if naturally we just always tried to either to be kind or uplift everything around us that women and the girls are doing.” — Antoinette Taus Pau Kimberly (@paukimberly) Self-love advocate, Pau Kimberly, uses TikTok as a platform to make others feel better about themselves. In a lot of her videos, she encourages her followers, the women in particular, to rise up after each fall. In Pau’s content, one powerful message that we all need to hear shines through – “You are enough.” “We as a society are not yet used to women standing up for themselves, women that are strong and independent, women that are empowered, women that are not believing in timelines, women that are very career-driven. I use my platform to raise awareness that we shouldn’t care about others’ opinions. We as women are enough, and are worthy, in our own rights.” — Pau Kimberly Veronica Limcaoco (@beloynica) Veronica “Ron” Limacaoco is an active member of Girls Got Game PH (@girlsgotgameph), a non-profit organization that works to empower young women through sports. The group organizes roving sports camps in underprivileged areas throughout the Philippines. Here, girls can learn how to play different sports, which helps them build self-confidence. As a result, Girls Got Game PH actually helps to build our country’s future, one self-reliant woman at a time. Veronica believes that women must work together to empower one another. “There’s no one perfect way to do things, like we are all after the same goal – Women empowerment. We are just doing it differently, I might be doing it through sports but in the end we only have the same goal, and it’s impossible for one person, one organization to do it all. So, the best thing to do is work together.” — Veronica Limacaoco Nove-Ann Tan (@ihomeschoolph) Homeschooling advocate, Nove–Ann Tan, is a hands-on homeschooling mom who also provides support for other homeschoolers. She has also authored two books, “I Homeschool: How to Homeschool Without Losing Your Mind” and “Happy Wife, Happy Life”, and hosts a weekly podcast where she shares valuable insights and information about homeschooling. For Nove-Ann, it is important to make other women feel that they are not alone in whatever they may be going through. “It’s making a message that ‘Hey, you are not alone, I am here.’ Magtulungan tayo. Never be ashamed of your your weakness, of what you’re going through, because you will never know, you’ll be a blessing. May isang taong lang na mag-swipe sa TikTok mo, kahit na isang tao lang ang matulungan sa message mo, it would be very valuable.” — Nove-Ann Tan Maica Teves Maica Teves is the Executive Director of Samahan ng mga Pilipina para sa Reporma at Kaunlaran (SPARK!)

"Angel Locsin reveals being diagnosed with depression, anxiety in the past",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/379576/angel-locsin-reveals-being-diagnosed-with-depression-anxiety-in-the-past/,"09:13 PM February 23, 2021","It may not be known to many, but actress Angel Locsin was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past. She made the revelation in her digital show “Iba ‘Yan” where mental health was tackled with Ricky Ducas, founder of Anxiety and Depression Support Group in Baguio City, as seen on ABS-CBN Entertainment’s YouTube channel on Sunday, Feb. 21. Ducas expressed his admiration for the actress, whom he said is also idolized by many for being an “epitome for women, strong women.” Locsin then pointed out that while others see this side of her, she is not without her own challenges to face. “’Yun ‘yung image ko talaga sa mga tao, ‘di ba, ‘yung strong. Makakatulong ba if sabihin ko na na-diagnose din ako ng depression and anxiety?” Locsin asked. (That’s really my image to people, right? That I’m strong. Would it help if I tell you that I was also diagnosed with depression and anxiety?) “Yeah, pero strong woman ako. Hangang ngayon strong woman ako. I have that condition and hindi siguro alam ng tao kasi wala naman nagtatanong, eh,” she said. (Yeah, but I am a strong woman. Until now I am a strong woman. I have that condition and people don’t know about it because no one asks.) “So, don’t worry, kung feeling mo ay alone ka diyan sa nararamdaman mo, marami tayo,” she said to comfort Ducas about his own struggles. (So don’t worry if you feel you’re alone with what you are going through. There are many of us.) She advised that what one has to do is to face the problem head on. She also stressed how it is not right to think of one’s self as a burden to others, and that it is important to take care of one’s self. Locsin, widely respected by her fellow actors for her relief efforts and charity work during calamities and amid the pandemic, has been internationally recognized for her philanthropy. She is set to marry her boyfriend this year, film producer and businessman Neil Arce.

How well is your ‘kasambahay’?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/378904/how-well-is-your-kasambahay/,"07:47 PM February 10, 2021","As we struggled through the pandemic, we may not have always thought about how it has affected our helpers’ physical and mental health Our yaya was supposed to have gone back to Zamboanga for vacation when the lockdown hit. She and many stay-in helpers were inadvertently stuck in their employers’ homes for an indefinite work stint, most without days off. When it was safer, we allowed our helpers to go to physical church even if we ourselves did not. But we needed to coach them extensively on safety as standards differ from person to person. As we struggled to power through the pandemic, we may not have always thought about how it has affected our household angels’ physical and mental health. “Pahuway” is Visayan for “rest, relax and reflect.” It is also the name of a yearly seminar given by De La Salle Zobel School that aims to equip kasambahay with knowledge related to their needs and work, to provide stress management techniques and to promote self-care. This year’s program was held online. School counseling head Erica Malli shared that the kasambahay seminar began in 2000. It was organized for those caring for their students. Asked about their dreams, various helpers shared how they wanted to be able to travel abroad, to have their children or themselves finish school, to have their own house and lot, or to be able to help their mothers. Not all kasambahay may have access to such a program, but household employers may want to take note of these and craft something similar for them. Guidance mentor Hannah Mamawal discussed how to gain awareness on stress and how to manage one’s self in stressful situations: “When we try to achieve our dreams, it can’t be helped that we encounter stress or trials in our lives.” The kasambahay defined stress as “hirap makatulog,” “pagod,” “nakakasira ng beauty,” “malungkot,” “nakakaloka,” “nakakapuyat” and feeling emotional. Stress is a physical and emotional reaction to change. It can be positive, when it gives you more energy or promotes growth and accomplishment, or negative, when it can cause sickness. Signs of stress include nervousness, sadness or anger, rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, sweating, pain or hardness in the neck, shoulders, jaw or face, headaches, tiredness, difficulty sleeping, diarrhea, stomach pain, no appetite or overeating, and weight loss. How can our helpers fight stress? Mamawal talked about mindfulness and learning different relaxation techniques that they can practice daily: deep and slow breathing, listening to music, reading, taking a warm shower, or doing something they enjoy (singing, playing with pets, exercise). She also talked about accepting things we cannot change (the 90/10 principle of Stephen Covey) and how we can control 90 percent of how we react. If your helper becomes heartbroken because their significant other left them, being stuck in your home without a face-to-face friend to talk to or the weekend to look forward to when they don’t have to put on a professional face, can be incredibly stressful and depressing, especially for kasambahay who have no access to data or Wi-Fi. Be mindful of such needs, and depending on your setup, you may need to be a source of emotional support. Mamawal advised them to take one day at a time, sleep eight hours daily, eat healthy and have someone to talk to. Breathing and tapping techniques by alternating negative tapping (“I’m stressed out and overwhelmed, I’ve got so much going on, etc.”) with positive tapping (“I choose to relax now, I choose to surrender now, I choose to find peace, I choose to find some space”) were also presented. Guidance counselor Dominique Sta. Cruz taught simple basic makeup looks as part of taking care of one’s self. She talked about its positive effects on one’s mental health. “It helps boost confidence, releases stress and enhances beauty.” If makeup is something you think your helpers are interested in, you can suggest appropriate tutorials on YouTube and maybe provide them with basic tools. Guidance counselor Jeri Gerido also taught basic photography tips and selfie hacks. She advised the kasambahay participants to know their angle, find their most comfortable side, be aware of lines and spaces, find a good spot with a good background, and be natural and confident. Gerido also gave tips on taking group and couple shots, lighting, food flat lay and travel photos. Social media has been the most accessible outlet for our kasambahay to express themselves, so photography is one of the best ways they can communicate their condition to the outside world. Since they live with us, it is natural to get emotionally invested in our kasambahay and vice versa. They may not only look to us for financial support, especially during these uncertain times; as they look after our family, let’s provide them with tools to help them look after themselves and support them in doing what makes them happy. —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

Kyla spoke about being affected by social media and the need to take a break from it, as per her Instagram page yesterday, Jan. 26. She also shared a photo of her taken during the video shoot of her collaboration with RnB singer Jay-R. “I felt like it was adding to my anxiety,” she said about her reason to temporarily delete her social media. “It’s nice to post pictures of your achievements and stuff like that – and get recognized for it. But I just feel like every time I would open it, someone is passively bragging about an accomplishment, [traveling] at this time when we can’t travel, getting new projects, etc,” she said. “It’s led me to always compare myself to others. And it’s not good for me.”   Isang post na ibinahagi ni KYLA (@kylaalvarez)  Eventually, she realized that she cannot completely shun social media, which necessitated her going back to her accounts. “Guess I couldn’t last more than a week doing this social media diet,” she explained. “I had to download it again, just to connect with my family.” She asked her fans to watch out for her video with Jay-R for the song “Undeniable,” and gave them a reminder: “Take care of your mental health as well.

"Grieving a loss, Cary Santiago picks up his brush again",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/377861/grieving-a-loss-cary-santiago-picks-up-his-brush-again/,"03:48 PM January 22, 2021","'It was for my mental health... When I paint, I’m able to forget'  Designer Cary Santiago is known for his laser-cut, perforated and intricately designed evening gowns that are one-of-a-kind. The Cebu-based designer made a name for himself in the Middle East before returning to the Philippines, where he was welcomed by Manila’s and Cebu’s most stylish women. Every month, he used to produce at least two bridal gowns and assorted evening wear for regular clients, but the pandemic effectively put a halt to his bustling business. Last March, he shut down his atelier and hunkered down at home. Like many of us, Santiago used social media to keep in touch with friends and family. Travel restrictions meant that the only vacation photos one could post were “throwbacks.” Six months into lockdown, he rediscovered his passion for painting but only began posting new “content”—mainly progress made in applying brushstrokes on canvas—in October. “I’ve always painted or done elaborate sketches,” Santiago told Lifestyle in a phone interview from his home in Cebu this week. In between pauses, where he instructed his helper on what to prepare for dinner that evening, we could hear birds in his garden, calling in the distance. “My mother was a costurera (sewer) and when I was in my early teens, she would ask me to copy photos from catalogs and magazines. That’s how I learned how to sketch,” he said. In high school, Santiago dabbled in makeup application and would come up with new colors by combining two or three shades of makeup. When he and other people discovered his talent for designing clothes a few years later, he stopped painting altogether. “Nobody was buying my paintings. They were not beautiful because at the time, it was difficult to get access to materials; those that were available were just too expensive. I became a fashion designer eventually. I was hired and was getting paid right away, so I stopped painting for a long time.” The strict lockdowns in Cebu last year, however, allowed him to slowly get back into painting. The solitude also allowed him to grieve the recent death of his best friend. When he paints, Santiago prefers listening to melancholy French songs even if he admits that he doesn’t speak any French. The emotion of the singer steadies him and helps propel him to complete a painting in three days. In three months, he was able to finish a total of 10 paintings, including some featuring brightly colored birds, a couple of horses, a sea turtle and an arowana. “I chose these subjects because I love the elements of air, earth and water,” he said. Santiago applies the same keen and artistic eye he uses when he designs to the way he paints. Instead of situating his subjects in nature, he prefers to let them stand out with a neutral background. “I have always been fascinated with anything that is flying, running or swimming. I’m fascinated with movement, but I make sure that my subjects are composed and are looking at me.” All 10 paintings have since been bought by clients and collectors including Dr. Vicki Belo, Mariquita Yeung and Bea Zobel de Ayala for prices ranging from P25,000 to P150,000. On Wednesday, he posted that over three dozen new orders for paintings have come in. In an earlier interview, Santiago pointed out the importance of saving up for a rainy day, but said that when he began painting again, he did so without intending to profit from it.  “It was really for my mental health. My best friend died. There were people I loved that I wanted to see but could not. When I paint, I’m able to forget. Listening to the French songs makes me more creative; I think that when you paint you have to be emotional.” There have been requests for portraits, but Santiago is not keen on the subject. “I’m a perfectionist and I can easily spot mistakes in portraits, like with clothes. But with animals you can change their colors, shorten their hair. For example, I can alter the color of a bird’s feathers, where instead of blue I can make it a bit violet.” He has begun accepting dress orders from returning clients but said he has no intention of stopping painting. In fact, next week he is launching two new services focusing on office uniforms and ready-to-wear dresses that will free up time so he can continue painting. “I will keep a few ‘madams’ (a term of endearment he uses for longtime clients), maybe 10 from Manila and 10 from Cebu who I will do made-to-measure for, but the rest of the business will be uniforms and ready-to-wear.” His paintings may be based on pictures taken by photographers, but as soon as it’s safe to venture outside, Santiago plans to take his own photos of his beloved fauna. He’s also considering doing paintings of exotic plants and flowers after a client requested one of tropical plants. “I won’t be doing common plants like gumamela. Instead I might paint phalaenopsis orchids. They’re my favorite.”   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"Much to be thankful for, more to be done",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/377748/much-to-be-thankful-for-more-to-be-done/,"10:57 PM January 19, 2021","On Feast of Santo Niño, let us look at three channels of care that society must provide for its children, if not its most vulnerable Jan. 17—Feast of the Santo Niño Readings: Isaiah 9: 1-6; Psalm 97, Response: The Lord is king; let the many isles be glad.; Ephesians 1: 3-6, 15-18; Gospel—Mark 10: 13-16Two of the most influential and inspirational global leaders of the 20th century share a similar view of what accounts for the measure and character of a society. Mahatma Gandhi said, “The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members” while Nelson Mandela said, “The true character of a society is revealed in how it treats its children.” On the Feast of the Santo Niño, I invite you to reflect on today’s Gospel, “Let the children come to me; do not prevent them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.” There is another perspective I wish to add for our reflection. This year is the 500th anniversary of the coming of Christianity to the Philippines, and with this we associate the devotion to the Santo Niño, the very first religious image and devotion Catholic Christianity brought here. Let us look at three services or channels of care that society must provide for its children, if not its most vulnerable and marginalized, regardless of age. The first, and more obvious, is the right to basic services. Let us prioritize just three. There are others, but these three are the most basic, I think and feel: health care, education and food security. Under health care, we face the problem of malnutrition, most especially the first 1,000 days of an infant that can inflict lifelong handicaps. Emerging as a health-care concern is mental health. While this is a concern across age groups, the youth are the most vulnerable. Again, much has been done in this area to provide support, but more needs to be done. For education, fundamentally, the problem of disparity is in access to education and the quality of education. The pandemic also highlighted food security. With the loss of jobs or income, providing for the basic needs of families, such as food, has become a widespread concern. The second channel of care is providing opportunities or access to material resources; in particular, jobs or income. One survey pointed out that heads of families prefer stable jobs over aid, or ayuda. Given the problem with education, this concern over access to jobs or income is further compounded. Lower skills jobs will soon disappear, which further narrows opportunities for the marginalized who have limited access to quality education. All these open our most marginalized to what I consider the greatest injustice: when they are robbed of their ability to hope and to dream. Pope Francis and many other writers tie this up with the direction the global economy is taking. With the exponential growth in technology in the fields of automation and robotics, and where most jobs are “STEM-ified” (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), hopes and dreams are further dimmed. The crisis may seem so economic in nature, but it is also a crisis of meaning, a crisis of the soul. In the year of the fifth centenary of Christianity in the Philippines, we ask and reflect, what is there to celebrate? Much, but more. There is much to be thankful for, but there is more that we need to do. The theme of the celebrations captures it well: “Gifted to Give.” Christianity has gifted us with many blessings, but there is so much more we can give—and desire to give. We need to do an individual and communal soul-searching. Begin with understanding what is there to celebrate as Christians, as the Philippine Church. Remembering is always the path to a genuine celebration, an honest remembering that leads us to, in Ignatian parlance, a realistic knowledge of ourselves and our world. This allows us to celebrate. In celebrating our deep sense of gratitude, it renews our faith in the gift of God, the gift of Christ to us—in him alone is our hope. The gift of this hope renewed, I pray, will be our first step toward a genuine celebration of 500 years of Christianity, giving us renewed inspiration to be a Church of the marginalized together. Gratitude leads us to give back in return—returning love for love in all things. —CONTRIBUTED INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
The Philippines has not been spared from this silent global pandemic,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/377708/the-philippines-has-not-been-spared-from-this-silent-global-pandemic/,"02:52 PM January 19, 2021","Obesity, defined by the WHO as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation, is a disease that leads to life-altering and potentially fatal consequences. It is the gateway to heart disease, various types of cancer, and diabetes. Six out of 12 obesity-related cancers are rising fastest among the millennial age group. In the Philippines alone, 33.2 million individuals live with this disease. Obesity in Philippine society and its relation to mental health One in three adult Filipinos has obesity. These cases are clustered in urban areas, namely Metro and Mega Manila, Cebu and Central Visayas, and Davao and Northern Mindanao. Filipino society does not handle obesity issues well. Overweight individuals often receive comments like “tumaba ka” or “magpapapayat ka nga.” These weight-related biases are an example of the stigma that people with obesity face every day, all of which contribute to feelings of depression. This results in individuals with low self-esteem and poor body image, and who are less inclined to find solutions and support. Research has shown a correlation between obesity and mental health problems. Published data documents a 55% increased risk of developing depression over time in people with obesity, while people who were depressed had a 58% increased risk of developing obesity. Obesity in the “New Normal” Obesity increases the risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms and triples the risk of requiring hospitalization. Additionally, an individual with obesity may have an impaired immune system and decreased lung capacity, which can make ventilation more difficult. The Philippines is now recognized as having the longest lockdown in the world. The limitations on mobility minimize physical activity, with most citizens working from home. Coupled with stress and boredom from the constant confinement, these conditions contribute to an increase in food intake. Stress eating, snacking, and getting fast food deliveries in an attempt to reclaim normalcy have resulted in unhealthy lockdown lifestyles. This puts Filipinos at a higher risk of developing obesity and facing complications should they contract COVID-19. The current generation is often credited with driving the global wellness market. The popularity of yoga, intermittent fasting, Keto diet, and other weight loss fads promise quick returns. However, these contribute to the misconception that obesity is an issue of physical appearance and simply requires a change in lifestyle. There is a need to create awareness for obesity as a medical concern. It is important to educate Filipinos about how obesity is a disease that interrupts the metabolic, biomechanical, and mental health of a person. Heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and the higher incidence of stroke, all begin with obesity. Finally, it’s important to separate the person from the disease. They are not obese people but rather, people with obesity. The first step to healing and the right path to wellness is awareness and acceptance, and that obesity, while a challenge, can be solved.

How Bubbles Paraiso has dealt with body dysmorphia,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/377219/how-bubbles-paraiso-has-dealt-with-body-dysmorphia/,"07:53 PM January 10, 2021","Actress and yoga teacher Bubbles Paraiso has battled with body dysmorphia for the longest time and is doing the best she can to still appreciate her body. Body dysmorphia is a mental health condition where the sufferer spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in appearance, usually unnoticeable to others, according to the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. Paraiso wrote a letter addressed to her body and acknowledged her physical flaws in her Instagram post yesterday, Jan. 9. She stated that she finds her legs too big. “Dear body, [thank] you for all that you allow me to do. I’ve suffered from body dysmorphia for the longest time — no matter what or how I looked, I would always find flaws and my legs have always been my biggest insecurity,” she said. While seeing her legs as bigger than normal, Paraiso feels they are “strong,” which for her has its own benefits. “But then again, these legs are strong. They’re not thunder thighs, they’re Power Thighs. (I mean… you’ve seen me bike, right? Lol),” she noted. Paraiso revealed that she has never been happy and comfortable with her body until lately, which has been possible because she has learned to embrace and love herself. “[My] body for what I am, for what it is…. flaws and all,” she said. “Here’s a reminder that you are good enough as you are. Love yourself a little more, you deserve that kind of love.” On the same day, Paraiso shared with fans and followers her checklist of the positive things she plans to do this 2021, namely: to protect her energy, to celebrate small steps and small wins, to embrace mistakes as lessons, to break up with fear, to make healing a priority, to try to learn something new everyday, and to be open to inspiration coming from unexpected places.

Posting her “favorite” photo of them, Imperial spoke of how the relationship blossomed from friendship to a romantic one. “Totally unexpected to fall for someone I thought I’d be just friends with forever but I’m really happy to have found both love & friendship with this one,” she said on Instagram.   A post shared by BARBIE (@msbarbieimperial) Imperial is grateful for Loyzaga coming into her life. “Thank you for making me happy & feel loved. Thank you for everything that you do to make me feel the love I deserve. So thankful for you, thank God for you,” she said, even using the hashtag “#angcheezynibarbie”. “Pagbigyan ngayon lang ulit naging ganito,” she quipped. (Please let me be, it has been a while since I have been this way.) On New Year’s Day, Loyzaga took to social media to make public his romantic relationship with Imperial. He posted a photo of them together with this caption: “Happy new year to us. Thanks for making the end of my 2020 memorable. [Let’s] gooo 2021!!” Before confirming their relationship, Imperial said last November during a guesting in “Magandang Buhay” that Loyzaga had been making his presence felt. “Siguro po nagpaparamdam,” she said when asked if Loyzaga is courting her. (Maybe he is trying to make his intentions felt.) “Actually po magkaibigan talaga kami before pa; super close talaga kami. Iyon nga po matagal po kaming hindi nagkita pero isa lang din po iyong grupo namin,” Imperial related. (Actually we have been friends since before; we are super close. But the thing is, it’s been a long time that we have not seen each other though we are part of the same group.) She admitted that their friends suggested they try dating, but they were reluctant. “Kasi noong 2018 hindi ba po parang ang dami kong pinagdaanan sa love life and si Diegs din. So parang ako, hindi kami perfect for each other nung time na iyon,” she explained. (In 2018, I went through a lot in my love life and so was he. So, for me, we were not perfect for each other at the time.) Back then, Imperial spoke up about being physically abused. Speculations were made that her bruises were from then-boyfriend Paul Salas. In the same year, she was romantically linked to “Araw Gabi” costar JM de Guzman. Loyzaga, meanwhile, faced mental health challenges and reportedly went to rehab to recover.

Self-fulfilling prophecy: Expect a good year for a good year,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/376887/self-fulfilling-prophecy-expect-a-good-year-for-a-good-year/,"11:58 PM December 29, 2020","(First of two parts) These are times when the coming new year still seems filled with a lot of uncertainties, but what is also comforting is the thought that 2021 can’t be any worse than this year. This year, which initially came with so much positive anticipation, since it indicated a perfect vision of 20/20, seemed to have blinded all of us. No one really saw it coming—not in our wildest nightmares! It started with the eruption of Taal Volcano, which made everyone realize that its small size could be deceiving. Then, COVID-19 broke out, not the type of infectious breakouts we’re so used to, but on a global scale, making “pandemic” an understatement. Life came to a standstill, like a clogged engine carburetor spluttering to a halt. We were on home quarantine for several months, and earning a living had to take a backseat. With so much time to ponder things, we realized the value of family, of friends and of life itself. The future, despite our previous grand plans, was suddenly of no moment. The only thing that mattered was the now, and how we could survive another day, week, month, or year, until hopefully it’s all over, and we could wake up from the nightmare. But it was also a defining moment for us, that despite such a challenging year, we discovered we were made of stronger stuff that God blessed us with. The adage, “When the going gets tough, the tough get going” suddenly became real. When the new year comes, we can all wave banners that we survived 2020, and we should be able to survive any other challenging year in our lifetime. This year was the Mt. Everest in our lives, and we’re nearing the peak. Actually, I think we’ve reached the peak, and we’re now on our way back down to base camp. We’ve been through the worst; it’s just a matter of completing the rest of the difficult journey with our current standard of care. Yes, we can look at the new year as an epiphany for most of us. Epiphanies are not everyday happenings; they lead us to significant realizations about important things in our lives. An epiphany makes us pause for a while and revisit what we’ve made of our lives, rethink our priorities and decide what we want to do for the rest of our lives. It gives us a feeling that no matter how we fared in the previous year—no thanks to COVID-19, or how we messed up our lives in the past—we’ve been given a clean slate and a fresh start once more. Whether we’re in our teens or in an age of aching bones or lapsing memories, we know the coming year can be made more meaningful if we could just reset our minds with a more positive orientation. It’s understandable how COVID-19 has adversely affected our mental health, and diminished our capacity to hope for good things to come, but the choice of what will happen is absolutely ours. We just have to make that decision and reclaim our control over our destiny. What we’ve become up to this point was largely influenced by the quality of the thoughts we’ve had all these years. The past somehow matters, but it hardly does when we realize that the rest of our lives will now depend on the kind of thoughts that we nurture from hereon. Let’s not allow our dread of COVID-19 to control our mindset, and incapacitate us into believing that life will remain at a standstill, and there’s nothing we can do about it. As we start the new year, the most important resolution that we can make for ourselves, for our families and for our nation is to have a positive mindset and expectations, no matter what COVID-19 may still have in store. Let’s also make a decision to be kinder to ourselves and to the people around us. Many times, we’re our own worst critic, and an even worse critic of others, of our leaders, of our nation. We fail to see the good things in our lives, in other people and in our country, and every small shortcoming is highlighted and even exaggerated. We’re good at making mountains out of mole hills. In past columns, we wrote about the tremendous impact of our mental disposition on our health, career, relationships and practically every aspect of our lives. We compared this to the internal or built-in GPS which directs our entire life to whatever we think of. We may not realize it, but many of the things that happen in our lives are due to our set expectations. It is what some would call a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we expect a bad year right at the start, like this week, chances are, we’re going to have a bad year. If we focus our thoughts on COVID-19 and what would happen to us if we get the virus, then we’ll likely attract the virus and possibly suffer from a life-threatening infection. Instead of focusing on problems like COVID-19, we can focus on the solutions and expect that things will turn out just as we would want them to. Let’s focus on a healthy immune system, and how our immune system’s killer T-cells are munching on all the viruses and bacteria that enter the body, like Pacman in the video game. Visualize that for a few minutes each day, thank God for it, and a reality it shall become. When despair and hopelessness grip us, repeatedly reciting Psalm 23 gives us the strengthening balm to allay all our fears: “The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want… Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me… Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.” Truly blessed are those who surrender everything to God during times like this. Here’s wishing everyone a blessed and bountiful 2021.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020

Visual artist Riz Cabrera has partnered with Smile Train to raise awareness for children born with a cleft through the launch of her online art auction which she hopes can contribute to sustaining Smile Train’s goal to provide children the urgent support and care needed. Every day, 540 babies are born around the world with this serious health condition that prevents them not only from smiling, but also poses difficulties in eating, breathing and speaking. Through the auction, Cabrera hopes to help fund the surgeries and therapies that could transform the lives of Filipino cleft patients. “When I came across the Smile Train website, I was deeply moved by their advocacy. While I initially wanted to just be a channel of blessings for the patients, my goal was to raise awareness for this generation, specifically to those dealing with mental health issues just like myself,” shared Cabrera. “Although we all have our own personal problems and trials, if we would just look beyond ourselves, we can still be a message of hope to somebody. I believe that focusing on helping other people is therapy itself and partnering with Smile Train rekindles hope within me,” she added. Visit 32auctions.com/smile2020 to view the artworks.

Single-use masks, gloves and the plastic bags from groceries and other purchases are instantly discarded in fear of the virus. Countless rolls of plastic cover have been used as dividers for social distancing. There’s also been an increase in the use of wipes, tissue, toilet paper and sanitizing products, producing even more waste. But there are still ways to care for the environment as we continue to keep our families safe from the virus. Luckily, there are people, organizations and companies that continue to be devoted to caring for the environment even in the midst of the pandemic. One such company is NutriAsia which reopened its BYOB(Bring Your Own Bote) store at the Mind Museum in Bonifacio Global City in August. They also opened BYOB in Quezon City Hall, the result of a partnership with the Quezon City local government unit. Zero-waste pioneer BYOB is a zero-waste pioneer in the country and it’s dedicated to promoting eco-friendly and green initiatives. In 2019, BYOB allowed customers to bring their own reusable bottles so they could get a refill of their favorite NutriAsia products and condiments without generating unnecessary waste. The store encourages responsible plastic use and is a step towards sustainability. For the reopening during the pandemic, NutriAsia made improvements to their popular refill service and modified it with everyone’s health and safety in mind. The staff wear PPE, masks, face shields and hair caps. Floor markers ensure that customers can observe social distancing while waiting for your turn. An alcohol dispenser is at the entrance too, so you can sanitize your hands anytime.  Want to BYOB? Your first step is ordering the NutriAsia products you want through an online and waiver form (https://cdn.jotfor.ms/nai.byob/orderform). You will receive an email that you need to present at the BYOB store. Then your bottles (make sure they’re clean and dry) go through a sterilization process using a UV-C sterilizer. They are then refilled and weighed. When that’s done, you can make your contactless payment using Gcash or BPI online. If you don’t have reusable bottles, don’t worry. You can buy a new 500ml glass bottle at the BYOB store for just P20. It’s been sterilized and ready to fill with your favorite NutriAsia products. A visit to the NutriAsia’s BYOB store is a great way to stock up on your pantry essentials while protecting the environment.

Spending time wisely during the pandemic,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/376141/spending-time-wisely-during-the-pandemic/,"04:37 PM December 14, 2020","As nationwide quarantines are carried out. The younger generations’ motivation, including my own, fell into hibernation as we lost battles against online shopping, binge-watching and junk food. Stretches of time ticked away as we were occupied by passive pursuits. With distance learning, students are expected to self-learn and answer all the activities that pile up with little time to rest. This leads to stress, showing that too much work is not good either. Time, then, is a significant factor when it comes to mental health. Managing it and spending it wisely are important ways of dealing with stress. When lockdowns were put in place, we were suddenly faced with what felt like indefinite, free time. As a young adult, I relished it because I could stay up all night, sleep in, and do whatever I wanted. But that didn’t last long as the repetition of meaningless activities started to mess with my temper. I knew I had to turn to creative outlets. Seeing how well-off our family is compared to some of our fellow citizens made me ashamed of how I spent my time. I got out of my shell, comfortable as it may be, and started thinking less of myself and more of how I may be of help to others, first and foremost to my family. Paying attention to what makes them happy is good practice for me to improve my relationships. Both of our parents are hard at work most of the time, so I took the initiative to help my younger sisters adjust when they started their online classes; and regulating their device use so that they won’t forget to rest their eyes and stretch some muscles. I also met a number of talented local artists on Instagram (@haruzaki_illust, @julieverse14, @rio_san2004, @shopbyandie) and did my best to support their small shops not only by purchasing their products but by sharing their content as well. Truly, health is wealth. Junk food is one of the myriad temptations at home. I found that actively participating in the preparation of food and cooking it ourselves is not only recreational but beneficial to our health as well. Cooking activates our olfactory and visual senses to signal the digestive process to start. Eating quickly does not facilitate this and overburdens our pancreas and liver. I was able to reconnect with my food experiences, how it connected me to the people I love. The fast pace of university life back then did not allow me to enjoy food as much as I wanted to, as I was constantly working against the clock and I couldn’t exercise often. Now I am encouraging my younger sisters to be as health-conscious as I am, inspired by the prevailing strength given by God to my father and mother who are over 70 and 50 years old and which I know they earned by perseverance. Taking my time in cooking, sharing meals with my family and reminiscing together, and thinking about health have made me pause and be grateful for God’s blessings. I’m not a plantita but I have enjoyed growing plants in the past. My parents are invested in agriculture so I am aware of some of the issues going on in the industry. I was reminded of these issues again as the pandemic hit our country and the demand for food security increased. So when I’m not cooking, journaling, doing science experiments, solving personal quandaries or exercising, I study about Israel’s agricultural advancements and watch documentaries on YouTube with my parents. Managing stress amid this pandemic isn’t easy but with the right practices to help us achieve the right mentality, it just could be. Every skill can be learned through patience and perseverance. Let us pursue the changes we want to see. —CONTRIBUTED The author is a 21-year-old Philosophy student at The University of Los Baños.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Things That Bring Us Joy During the Pandemic,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/374812/things-that-bring-us-joy-during-the-pandemic/,"03:08 PM November 20, 2020","The COVID-19 crisis has definitely turned a lot of lives upside down. Regardless if you are a social butterfly or not, everyone could feel the effect of the limitations that it has put on our regular lifestyles, something that a lot of us are still trying to deal with months after the country has been placed on quarantine. Besides the danger of the virus itself, another challenging thing that a lot of us face has a lot to do with being stuck in our homes most of the time. This is especially hard for the homemakers out there, who, besides working, also have to manage their tasks on top of taking care of their families. Then there are also the solo dwellers—people who are stuck in the city living far from their loved ones—who had to stay put (and stay sane!) while quarantining alone.  “It was really hard for me. I’m not someone who really loved going out when everything was still normal, but it’s different when you’re really required to stay put at home,” shares Katrina, a 30-something content manager who has been stuck alone in her city condo ever since the quarantine started in March. “I’m not complaining because I understand that it is for the safety of everyone, but it does affect your mood and even your mental health.” Thankfully, one of our best aspects as Filipinos is to always find a silver lining in everything we face. For Katrina, that involved getting into hobbies that she never would have expected she would enjoy doing before. “For me, it’s baking. I was surprised because I used to be really bad in the kitchen, but after watching some YouTube videos, I got inspired. I bought a mini electric oven and just got into it.” This does not come as a surprise since the hobby has skyrocketed in popularity over the past few months. Whether it is to blow off some steam or to start a mini business, many people are getting their hands all floured up lately by getting creative in the kitchen. “It gives me the break that I need,” shares Gladys, a mother of one and a part-time copywriter. “I have to juggle work and taking care of my daughter, but I also want to have time for myself. I love baking because you can really create something out of the activity, which is calming and relaxing in itself.” She adds, “I actually started my own business. I started with cookies, but now I have also been making breads and cakes. It turned out to be another source of income for me, too.” When asked about how she started her mini business, Gladys suggested getting the right ingredients as the first and most important step. “There’s a lot of trial and error, but the success of baking is all about using the right ingredients. I love using the flour from Joy of Baking because they are beginner-friendly and is of good quality.”  Joy of Baking is a notable brand of Agri Pacific Corporation, under the Rebisco Group of Companies. Since starting in 2015, it has been providing innovative flour products in the market using advanced Swiss and German milling technology. Moreover, the brand also follows stringent quality assurance to produce the best flour. The company also produces some of the best oil, shortening, and other baking products in the industry. For an average Filipino home baker, baking can be very intimidating. With Joy of Baking, however, everyone can now make home-baked tasty breads, pastries and cakes all the time. The Joy of Baking Complete Breadmix, for example, is perfect for making quick and easy breads like pandesal, ensaymada, and spanish bread because of its all-in-one formula and a free pack of yeast that comes in every bag. The Joy of Baking All-Purpose Flour, on the other hand, is ideal for baking and cooking needs like chocolate chip cookies, fried chicken, and banana breads. The Joy of Baking Cake Flour is a high quality flour that is perfect for moist, light, and fluffy cakes like chiffon, sponge, and batter type cakes. Lastly, the Joy of Baking Bread Flour is the best flour in making loaves, buns, and other breads. All fours are also fortified with Vitamin A and Iron making them healthy options for baking. Lately, Joy of Baking has also been even more focused on supplying the best materials to home bakers during the pandemic. Maria Minna Vistan, Senior Marketing Manager of Flour Division shares, “We want to encourage everyone to start, continue, or even improve their talent for baking. Since we are all staying at home, the best we can do is to make the best out of these moments. Baking is a great hobby because of the sense of comfort and satisfaction that it provides. It’s hard, but everyone can find their piece of joy during this time. You wouldn’t know what kind of happiness a slice of homemade bread can bring you until you try.” In addition to this, Joy of Baking has also been more proactive in reaching out to the community. The brand is actually inviting resellers from Cavite and Metro Manila so they could easily reach and encourage more people to get into a hobby. In the midst of this challenging climate, it aims to serve as a catalyst of change and hope by helping everyone start their own home business or simply bring the joy of baking and cooking at home as community resellers.

"Maxene Magalona, Rob Mananquil embark on a 10-day silent retreat",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/374568/maxene-magalona-rob-mananquil-embark-on-a-10-day-silent-retreat/,"06:37 PM November 15, 2020","Actress and yoga instructor Maxene Magalona, based now in Bali with her husband, musician Rob Mananquil, will undergo a 10-day Vipassana meditation silent retreat with him. Magalona cited several reasons for joining the retreat as per her Instagram page last week. “One of the main reasons why we decided to join this retreat is because ever since we’ve been beautifully stranded/divinely placed here in Bali during this pandemic, we decided to study and take as many courses, workshops and retreats that we can which we know will help us heal, grow and become the best versions of ourselves,” she said. “We really believe that this global pause is the best time to unlearn old and unhealthy habits to make space for new and helpful ones,” Magalona added. The couple learned about the Vipassana meditation technique from Mananquil’s sister Raya Mananquil DeLeon who was the original yogini in the family. “She did it many years ago and said that it was one of the toughest things she ever had to do but also one of the most rewarding,” Magalona said. The couple was so inspired by her that they decided to do the retreat themselves to have a personal experience of what it is all about. She said Rob wanted to do it at the beginning of the year in the Philippines but their schedules did not permit it, and she admitted to not being ready yet at that time. “Now that we’ve been praying to God to send us messages about which steps to take on this healing journey, one of our yogi friends here in Bali told us about the Vipassana retreat with @meditationdave of @the_yogi_lab which he took last September and said that it was one of the best decisions he had ever made,” she shared. Magalona also spoke about how she saw the sign that she and Rob needed to join the retreat. “He said he loved it so much that he decided to join the one in November which happens to be on the 11th until the 22nd. When he mentioned the dates and we noticed that it ends exactly one day before my birthday, we took it as a clear sign from God that we were meant to do this,” Magalona revealed. Magalona believes that the retreat will help her heal since this meditation technique is known to address complex post-traumatic stress disorder, the mental health condition which her psychiatrist diagnosed her with. “My birthday wish is for more people to meditate with us during this transformative experience so that we can all help the world recover by healing ourselves,” Magalona said.

‘These feelings are normal’: Solenn Heussaff speaks up on dealing with postpartum depression,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/374325/these-feelings-are-normal-solenn-heussaff-speaks-up-on-dealing-with-postpartum-depression/,"09:10 PM November 10, 2020","When actress Solenn Heussaff gave birth to her and husband Nico Bolzico’s first child, Thylane Katana, with it apparently came bouts of depression. Heussaff spoke about that phase she went through after she gave birth in her Instagram page today, Nov. 10, where she also shared a photo from her maternity shoot. “Though pregnancy is the best thing I have experienced, there is a lot you go through people don’t always talk about. Postpartum. AKA your mental health and state,” she stated. After giving birth to her daughter, Heussaff dealt with a state of depression and self-pity. She looked back on how devastated she felt about her physical state. “I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror, didn’t want people to come visit me, wanted to diet but couldn’t because feeding my baby was a priority, being conscious about the dark spots on my tummy, the way my armpits looked, feeling useless because no matter how much I ate my baby was crying from hunger because of my low milk supply and the list goes on,” she recalled. Heussaff believes that “no one truly understands it unless they go through it.” “All of these feelings are normal but I hated myself for feeling this way because I felt I was being selfish,” she explained. “And it is important to talk to people about how you feel and to be ok with it. YOU are important.” Since giving birth and despite the depression she had to deal with, Heussaff has consistently interacted with her fans via Instagram, where she shares random daily moments with her baby or engages in antics with Bolzico.

Virtual pageant seeks muse for ‘wholistic’ fitness,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/373975/virtual-pageant-seeks-muse-for-wholistic-fitness/,"04:11 PM November 04, 2020","MANILA, PHILIPPINES—With the COVID-19 pandemic changing the global landscape, a new national beauty pageant hopes to highlight what it takes to navigate the “new normal” caused by the international health crisis. “Good physical, emotional and mental health and strength are important for us to become better people inside and out, to strive for our goals,” Louise Theunis, national director of the Miss FIT Philippines pageant, told the Inquirer in an online interview. “FIT” stands for “face,” “intelligence,” and “tone” (toned body), according to the organizers. She said the competition wishes to emphasize “wholistic fitness” because “total fitness is taking a more profound role in fighting the pandemic, making this pageant more relevant than ever.” Twenty-four aspirants from around the country have been chosen to compete in the purely virtual pageant. “The official Miss FIT Philippines candidates will be competing in various categories including swimwear and evening gown competitions, fitness challenge and, of course, the question-and-answer portion,” Theunis shared. Various virtual activities on personality development, public speaking, stress management, skin care, nutrition, and exercise are also scheduled to help the candidates become better versions of themselves, the national director continued. The organizers have yet to announce the competition’s final date, but the winner is set to take home P100,000 in cash, while the four runners-up will receive a total of P140,000. “The Miss FIT Philippines queens must have what it takes to be a good role model to other women, to bring the essence of the Miss FIT Philippines advocacy with them during their reign as they inspire and empower others to be fit,” Theunis said. The pageant’s advocacy, she said, centers on holistic fitness, “defined as good physical, emotional and mental health and strength of the empowered woman. The winners will reign for a year until the next staging of the national competition, which is expected to be a live event next year.

She can still be detached from the rest of the world. A world going through a horrible pandemic.  On social media, Kim recently shared her 40th birthday tropical getaway. As people are stuck at home, naming the cracks on their ceiling or going through the most heartbreaking experiences, Kim is living it up on a private island. The rules do not apply to Kim even if the United States sees the highest rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths, economies plunge into recession, and mental health troubles reach alarming levels. Among many, many other pressing problems. Trying to dodge the criticism, she talks about how thankful she is for her life. It hasn’t worked as multiple platforms put out think pieces and call out articles. You’re currently reading this one that I’m writing in the comfort of my private home office cramped between my closet and kitchen. I guess it’s really Kim’s world, and I’m just living in it.   A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Oct 27, 2020 at 10:59am PDT  Vox goes in at Kim’s lavish birthday extravaganza in a piece entitled, “Kim Kardashian’s Performative Quarantine.” It perfectly sums up how we are not the same to rich people: “When Kim Kardashian acknowledges how wonderful and blessed her life is, for instance, what should that really mean? That she has the bare minimum amount of societal awareness to note that not everyone in the world can host an impromptu surprise private island getaway for their dozens of friends?

Time for a ‘world society’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/373461/time-for-a-world-society/,"02:39 PM October 27, 2020","“IF YOU wish to see the big picture, you need a big heart,” says Judy Johnson, Canadian author, organizational facilitator, and government consultant for leadership development. Why bother, when all that these times of acute uncertainties seem to require of us is to stay alive? Because, Johnson says, “However frightening the situations that the whole planet is facing now, this could be an opportunity to come together as a world society.” She proposes that everyone should be an “artist” in the conduct of his life. “When every facet of life is filled with the highest energy, living becomes art.” Thought power How this works is the subject of her talk on Oct. 29, “Supreme Thinking: Its Importance and Urgency in These Critical Times.” Hosted by Brahma Kumaris Philippines, the class is part of a free online series held Thursdays, 6-7 p.m. Johnson, a teacher of meditation at the Brahma Kumaris center in Halifax, Nova Scotia, has coached people across the globe on easy methods of living with meaning and grace. “Quality of life,” she maintains, “is the result of small actions repeated day after day, for a long time.” For 35 years, she has worked with government and private sectors in international and intercultural settings. Her workshops are known for being “simple, yet memorable.” From Albay to Tagum Johnson has spoken to local audiences from Albay in Southern Luzon to Tagum in Southern Mindanao (plus Metro Manila, Tagaytay City, Naga City and Cebu City in between) on such diverse subjects as “Love Beyond Romance,” “Health and Wealth through Meditation,” and “Keeping Goodness Alive.” She has authored three books that have been praised as “practical explorations of one’s inner landscape.” However, in her most recently published articles—among them “Creating Peace in a Divided World” and “Spirituality for Mental Health—she uses world-view lenses and echoes her responses to questions often asked during her numerous lectures around the world. Can we hope to recover our balance at the end of this unusually trying period? Meanwhile, what do we do with all this time in our hands? Massive change came to us all without warning. It made everyone uncertain of everything. There has been a marked increase in crime, domestic violence, and corruption everywhere as the world becomes more fragile and people feel more insecure. The more insecure the people are, the more self-centered they can become. We have been conditioned by regional, cultural, political, or religious views of the world. These beliefs that shaped us as individuals prevent us from seeing others as equals. Does this mean we are a long way from resolving the situation? At the very least, it is unlikely that the methods we have used to solve our problems in the past will work now. As Albert Einstein said, “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking that we used to create them.” It is time to step back and use a deeper perspective to find new solutions. We could use this time to embrace our human family. And then we can do amazing things. More and more, the pandemic is being seen as the cause of mental health concerns worldwide. Does this mean the resolution of the latter depends completely on the resolution of the first? Anxiety and depression were declared a global mental health pandemic before COVID-19. Social distancing has left us alone with our minds, having eliminated distractions that we previously employed (to curb restlessness and panic). This forced introversion is intensifying a plethora of mental health issues. What help can a meditation practice offer in this time of intense emotional and mental disturbance? Meditation helps me accept myself as the living being that makes everything in the body, including the brain, function. Therefore, I am not my brain. If brain chemistry is out of balance, it can cause depression or anxiety. Understanding this dichotomy allows me to detach from the experience of depression. Instead, I can support the healing process by creating new attitudes and approaches from positive thoughts. Through meditation, I become familiar with peace, my natural state of mind. I immediately see when my peace has been eclipsed by another energy. (There are two ways to participate in Judy Johnson’s class on Thursday: via Zoom  or facebook.com/rajayoga.makati.

Quarantine University is back in session,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/372824/quarantine-university-is-back-in-session/,"05:55 PM October 17, 2020"," Lawyer Chel Diokno’s Quarantine University was back in session to celebrate World Mental Health Day on Oct. 10. This time, our classmates were Cheats band members and husband-and-wife podcasting team Saab Magalona and Jim Bacarro, Miss Trans Global winner Mela Habijan, YouTuber AC Soriano, and Dr. RJ Naguit, national chairperson of Youth for Mental Health Coalition. Just like in the previous session held on International Youth Day in August, the class started with Diokno taking attendance and then quizzing his students in a graded recitation. He asked Habijan, “What were you in school? Were you the teacher’s pet? Were you the class president? The most likely to succeed?” “I am everything you said,” Habijan said. “Growing up, I always inculcated within me that I had to fight for my space. Being an LGBTQ+, I’ve always been reminded that the label ‘gay’ or ‘trans’ or being LGBTQ+ will always be seen as a weakness. Therefore, my defense mechanism was to be good at school. I had to perform well, I had to make sure I was on top of everything and ’yun ’yung nakasanayan ko. “I always had to be my best, so before they see me as this gay little kid or now as a trans person, they’ll see me as someone who’s intelligent and smart. But now, things have reversed. I want them to see me as a trans woman and that being trans allows me to be intelligent, to be smart and someone who can transform.” “Grabe, class ba ’to or Miss Universe?” a viewer commented.“You’re beautiful inside and out,” wrote another. During the group discussion, they talked about their low points during the pandemic. “When the lockdown was announced, the first thing I asked myself was, ‘Paano ako mabubuhay?’ Dahil lahat ng kabuhayan ko na-cancel unti- unti,” Habijan, an actor, mentor and events host, said. “What dawned on me was, it was the end of my career.” She spent time reflecting, crying and asking God what to do next. She found comfort in watching the Thai boys love (BL) show “2gether: The Series.” Naguit said, “Very important sa atin ’yung pag-express ng emotions natin especially kung mabigat na siya sa atin. In a time of pandemic, posibleng magkaroon talaga tayo ng negative emotions—pwede tayo magalit, malungkot, magluksa kasi nagkaroon tayo ng loss of mobility and madaming mga uncertainties. Ito ’yung mga tinatawag nating ambiguous loss. Hindi natin alam kung nawala na ba talaga sila or kung babalik pa ang mga ito. Very important na napag-uusapan natin ito ngayon, at least napoproseso natin ang mabibigat na nararamdaman natin.” Bacarro, who runs the Filipino shirt brand Linya-Linya with friends Ali Sangalang and Panch Alvarez, said, “I think the most difficult part was, we had to close a lot of stores in the malls. I had to tell people I cared about that they wouldn’t be working for a few months. I had no answers. It was the first time I was put in that position. And I had to do it via Zoom pa.” Magalona added, “You tried so hard to provide what you could as a business pero it just wasn’t working anymore and it was very tough.” Bacarro said, “I’m just glad Linya-Linya was able to survive the storm.” Working from home was a big switch for Bacarro. “I have a certain workflow . . . It was about adjusting and reminding myself that I have other people here . . . ”Magalona, a breastfeeding mom to two babies, has been working from home for a while. “I had feelings pero alam mong kawawa naman ’yung iba so parang ayaw mong magreklamo, nahihiya ako. I’m also freaking out but I know a lot of people have it so much worse. Nandun ’yung guilt na magreklamo or even vent about it . . . are my feelings valid?” she said. “You have to remind yourself that there are things that are outside your control,” said Naguit. “Somehow may magagawa ka for them but we can’t solve everyone’s problems. Meron tayong limits as people. And we need to recognize that we have our own ways of coping so we cannot compare ’yung coping natin with another person.” Soriano, who graduated from college in February, said, “Parang gumuho ’yung mundo ko. I had really big dreams for 2020. Tapos parang nasisira ng nasisira ’yung hopes mo. Eventually, I just took it one day at a time, I allowed myself to rest. Somehow nakakapagtrabaho pa rin naman ako, thankfully.” Soriano is working with a telco on creating a program that donates a modem to a student with no connectivity for every modem purchased by a customer. “’Yun ’yung mga pinagkakaabalahan ko. I still choose to look at the brighter side.” Naguit said, “I think it’s very important na magkaroon tayo ng sense-making sa mga nangyayari sa atin na negative things. Sabi nga ni Viktor Frankl, ‘Suffering ceases to be suffering once we find meaning in it.’ Important na i-channel natin ’yung energies natin to something also very productive. Pero syempre kailangan din natin kilalanin na hindi naman pwede na all the time ay 100-percent productive ka . . . You also have to cut yourself some slack. ’Yun ’yung minsan mahirap—how do you lower ’yung expectations sa sarili mo? ’Yun ’yung mga naririnig ko sa mga bata ngayon.” Talk turned to the toxicity of social media and keeping updated about what’s happening in the country. Habijan said, “Some people have stopped reading the news. I disagree with that because you still have to be in the know. Although guilty din ako . . . because [with] the government’s response to COVID-19, huminto na talaga ako, nawalan na talaga ako ng pag-asa pagdating sa pagreresponde sa sitwasyong ito.”Magalona said, “Nakaka- depress talaga ’yung mga nangyayari . . . Being a mother of two boys, I have to be happy around them but on the other hand, I don’t want to give up on the country. Kaya natin ’to.” Diokno asked Naguit how to handle bashers or people making threats online. Naguit said, “You need to take a step back kung overwhelming na siya.” And change your notification settings, he said. “We have control over these things. Sometimes we just need to be mindful of how we use social media.” Habijan said, “We have to choose our battles . . . There are people who do not deserve our attention, but at the same time, there are people we have to respond to because it’s an opportunity to educate.” They talked about support systems, coping mechanisms and the importance of harnessing the power of social media for positive things. “It’s up to us how to use it. ’Yung social media in the time of pandemic became my means to fulfill dreams,” Habijan said, referring to her joining—and winning—virtual pageant Miss Trans Global and starting her online show “3Some,” where she’s interviewed guests like KC Concepcion and Vice President Leni Robredo. “I think we should learn from that, that the pandemic shouldn’t stop us from achieving our dreams,” said Diokno. In their podcast “Wake Up with Jim and Saab,” Bacarro said, “We always promote gratitude.” Their audience is young, he said, and they’ve been encouraging them to register to vote. “Not everyone is as fortunate as us to get decent information, to know what the country needs . . . yes, manage the information you receive, it doesn’t mean you should withdraw lang,” Bacarro added. “You should still actively seek the information necessary to actually contribute. Kasi kung lahat tayo, we submit to the fact na, ‘Okay, lahat ng people running this country engot,’ bakit tayo rin magiging engot? You have to seek to be educated pa rin. Just look for the mediums that won’t compromise your mental health.” Quarantine University is on Chel Diokno’s Facebook page.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Neri Naig wants to return to painting,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/371334/neri-naig-wants-to-return-to-painting/,"10:33 PM September 22, 2020","Neri Naig is thinking about returning to painting, a hobby of hers which took a back seat when she started getting busy as a housewife and businesswoman. Naig feels the need to go back to painting as seen in a post she made on Instagram yesterday, Sept. 21. “Mas maganda pala na mas darker ang pininta ko dati,” the mompreneur said about her painting, a photo of which she showed in the post. (It’s beautiful that I used darker shades before.) She admitted that she doesn’t have any formal training in painting, but she got into it before as a hobby. She appears to be missing it now. “Parang gusto ko ulit maglaro sa canvass. May time pa ba ako? Gagawa ng way!” she wondered. (It’s like I want to play again with the canvass. Do I still have time? I’ll find a way.) With the pandemic forcing people stay at home, Naig feels that one should have some diversion to be productive and to prevent being burned out. She cited hobbies such as reading, playing the guitar and gardening as some forms of positive diversion that also promote mental health. “Simulan mo na, matatapos na ang lockdown ay wala ka pa ring nauumpisahan,” she said. (Start it now, before the lockdown finishes and you’re not able to start anything.)

QUICK QUIP: Creating the perfect space with model Steffi Ziebert,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/371147/quick-quip-creating-the-perfect-space-with-model-steffi-ziebert/,"09:42 PM September 21, 2020","Elusive, but not quite. That’s what Steffi Ziebert is. That kind of cool girl who’s not into the tag. Still, you’ll see her pop up in ad with a major beauty brand, and also share her opinions about today’s news. Somewhere between the days melting together, Steffi put up Sabina Room. When the notification popped up on the phone, we knew that we just had to catch up. What is Sabina Room? 
Sabina Room is a home and room decor store. I named it after my second name Sabina, and I like to think of my items as a little glimpse of my “room” and things I like. Tell us about what’s available.
The items in Sabina Room are mostly things that I found, and I’m interested in. Being stuck in my room during this pandemic made me think about everyone else who is stuck in theirs who also want to spice up their decor. Why did you pursue Sabina Room, given the situation?
Being stuck in my room became my everyday routine.  I figured, why not turn this routine into something I can enjoy?  I love fixing and re-arranging my room because I realized it helped my mental health a lot. Having a room with items that I like to see gives me a better mood. I want to share this happiness with people who have a similar taste as me. In the past, when I would find something interesting to put in my room, I would immediately tell my friends and family about it. So Sabina Room is the same but with (I like to think) a broader reach. What should we watch out for without giving away too much?
More cute and useful items for the perfect quarantine room. Six months into the lockdown, what have you enjoyed about life-at-home? 
I miss going out, and all but life-at-home has made me closer to my family more than ever. And I’ve discovered a lot about myself as well. What’s your routine?
Most days, I wake up and have breakfast with family, then I check Sabina Room for orders and inquiries. I lounge around watching shows and movies until the afternoon. I then try to do a few home workouts. I’ve been doing personal art projects as well. From time to time, I call my friends on Zoom or video chat to catch up. Who do you think we should follow on social media?
@everywhereweshoot, @lizmariahv, @subicbae, and @gustafwestman The music you have on loop? 
I’ve been listening to a lot of different music lately, depending on my mood. Most days, I listen to ’90s house music. Other days I listen to pop music too. I have Loner’s new EP Into Midnight on loop recently! At-home look that makes you feel better?
Oversized shirt and little shorts! What’s the best spot in your room?
My closet has a bigger window than my room, so I love staying there because it’s brighter during the day, and that’s where I shoot my content. What do you do to take a break?
Some days I just let myself do nothing and be free from the pressure of “being productive.”  QUICK QUIP: Aryanna Epperson on keeping a peachy outlook  Bela Padilla debuts skincare line born out of love for K-Dramas    CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020

Bicol is a hotspot for art. Look at how Salingoy Art Group is taking its annual September fiesta exhibit online with pintaFRANCIA sa Pandemya. At the height of the feast of Our Lady of Peñafrancia, patroness of the Bicol region, the exhibit shows off Salingoy’s recent efforts. Twenty-one artists have put up their respective artworks that collectively present their rumination on how art helps with healing during the ongoing global health crisis. Grace De Luna, one of the artists featured, describes how her works like “Same Parts” and “Aabutin” directly reflect her process and experience in the past few months. “I created these four pieces during the ECQ period when I locked myself in my room and binge-watched American Horror Story.  I was in a mental health slump at that time, and creating them helped me deal with that.” Other artworks play with landscapes associated with Naga. Spot them in the works of Roderick Imperio featuring bucolic scenes and the different landmarks of the area. Some are perfect snapshots of today’s reality with characters in face masks, going about pre-COVID-19 activities. Salingoy Art Group’s founding member Pancho Piano focuses on the image of Our Lady of Peñafrancia for this exhibit. Other artists participating in pintaFRANCIA sa Pandemya are Marcial Abay, Jr., Hermel Alejandre, Geraldvic Badong, Jr., Warren Balane, Melissa Basmayor, Maria Nessa Buena, Dario Buan Encinas, Marizeal Joy Cata, Jao Deauna, Junie Linsoco, Gemmalyn Vela Padilla, Nitoy Peñera, Rommel Perez,  Jerome Sta.

ASK A DERMA: How is dry skin related to stress?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/370264/ask-a-derma-how-is-dry-skin-related-to-stress/,"07:04 PM September 07, 2020","In one of our first ASK A DERMA features, we talked about how stress is linked to pimples. Other people, however, may not be experiencing spots, but manifest the effects of stress via dry skin. If you’re reaching for lotion more than usual, it’s not just the lack of moisture or the weather. The stress about these days could be affecting your skin health. How? And what can one do to avoid it? These are a few questions we brought to Dr. Antonio C. Sison, Psychiatry, Dermatology, and EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). How do medical experts define stress? It was Hans Selye who, in 1936, coined the word “stress.” It’s defined as “the non-specific responses of the body to any demand for change.” He later used the term stressor to describe the stimulus to distinguish the stress response. One misconception is that stress is negative and is a threat to one’s well being. There is also eustress, which helps the person perform better. In contrast, when the person feels a level of stress is overwhelming, the person would experience distress resulting in lowered performance. Stress was of particular interest in the medical field, which propelled the description of Psychosomatic symptoms. These are bodily symptoms and sensations triggered by stress or other psychological symptoms. In 2010, the International Classification of Diseases included Acute Stress Reaction as a diagnosis. From 1936 up to the present, we see the development and recognition of the impact of stress on medical and mental health. What are the different skin conditions that stress causes? The field of Psychodermatology studies the interplay of the brain and the skin. One focus of interest is the impact of stress and skin. When one is under extreme stress, the body responds by increasing levels of cortisol and other hormones, which may lead to increased oil production resulting in skin breakouts. Further stress can also be a cause of hair loss. Moreover, stress can cause chronic skin conditions like acne, psoriasis, rosacea, and eczema to flare or worsen. And when this happens, this may become another stressor for the patient. Parents are advised to be watchful on the impact of stress on young children. At that age, they would not be able to communicate their feelings. Stress may cause a flare of the child’s atopic dermatitis, causing itchiness, which may disturb the child’s sleeping patterns. These symptoms, in turn, further aggravate the stress level of the child. This highlights the importance of addressing both stress and the skin condition of the person. Why is dry skin linked to stress? The stress response increases levels of cortisol and related hormones, which could lead to a decrease in the synthesis of hyaluronic acid. Moreover, persons under stress may forget their usual skincare routine, another possible reason for dry skin. Additionally, the person may forget to drink adequate amounts of water, which may lead to dehydration. Since I mentioned earlier that children are also vulnerable to adverse effects of stress, such as skin problems, it’s important to note that a child’s skin is much thinner than that of adult skin. This makes a child’s skin more permeable and more prone to dryness than adult skin. Dry skin increases the risk of developing skin conditions. What are habits people often do that exacerbate dry skin? This is a very interesting topic since I observe that Filipinos have concepts of cleanliness that lead to habits that contribute to dryness of the skin. Typical examples are the excessive use ofhilod, stone, face towel, or loofah during bathing, use of strong soaps, hot water, and taking long baths. Excessive use of alcohol-based skin products, excessive face and hand washing, along with using exfoliating products can contribute to dry skin. Other habits that make dry skin worse are alcohol drinking as it induces loss of water, smoking as it depletes Vitamin C, inadequate intake of water, and having an inconsistent skincare regiment. What are things one must look or avoid in soaps, lotions, and other skincare products to alleviate dry skin? Avoid sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). This is a surfactant — a compound in many cleansing detergents that degreases and washes dirt away. This ingredient is also in certain body washes, shampoos, and facial cleansers. It’s an effective cleanser, and some people can use it on their body and face with no adverse side effects. But since surfactants can have a drying effect on the skin, soaps containing SLS can cause further drying in people with already dry skin. Look for glycerin. If you can’t find a natural soap, look for products that have glycerin, which will provide the skin with enough moisture. Avoid added fragrances and alcohol. Fragrances, ethyl, and alcohol can dry the skin and irritate. When shopping for soap, it also helps to smell it before buying it. It’s not uncommon for soaps and body washes to have added fragrances. This appeals to the senses, but it can mess with the skin. If you are looking for a soap with scent, it is best to ensure that the soap’s perfume content is held to a minimum. Avoid synthetic dyes. Not only should you look for ingredients that hydrate the skin, but it’s also important to avoid artificial colors. Synthetic colors are chemically achieved and typically harmful to the skin, the likes of which may exacerbate dry skin problems rather than relieve them. It is best to use a soap that is designed for dry and sensitive skin that is suitable for everyday use. One example is Oilatum. This soap is an emollient cleanser that is suitable for daily cleansing. Oilatum has protective anti-oxidants, is non-GMO, contains no animal derivatives, and is paraben-free – which makes it safe for both parent and child.   Oilatum Soap Bar.

‘Love is not tourism’: Hope for couples kept apart by coronavirus,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/368451/love-is-not-tourism-hope-for-couples-kept-apart-by-coronavirus/,"01:01 PM August 13, 2020","PARIS, France — Are the long months of lonesome waiting finally over? Coronavirus travel restrictions have kept lovers and unmarried couples apart since the outbreak, but governments around the world are now showing more understanding of their plight, with some introducing measures to allow a happy and long-awaited reunion. Before the pandemic, Frenchman Nicolas Perret would meet his partner — who lives in Russia — in one or the other country using a tourist visa. They last saw each other several months ago. “At some point this will all come to an end. We know that much, but no one knows when, or how much harm it will have done,” the 50-year-old engineer told AFP, saying they have considered changing jobs, taking up studies again or even getting married in order to reunite. Some governments permitted married couples and civil partners to get round travel bans and join their other half, but couples lacking official paperwork to prove their relationship were kept separated. The rules — judged unfair by melancholy lovers — prompted a worldwide social media campaign called “Love is not tourism”. “It is obvious that we must halt tourism to protect us and others,” the lobby group said on a website set up to back the campaign. “But love is not tourism. This is not just about a summer holiday, it is about mental health and the future of people all around the world.” Non-essential travel to the European Union remains prohibited from a number of countries, including the United States, with exceptions for EU citizens, residents and their families. In theory, member states can choose to allow unmarried partners in documented relationships to enter the EU, but in practice few do so. On Friday, the European Commission urged member states to end many couples’ torment and allow entry for unmarried partners of European citizens and residents. Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, has sent a questionnaire quizzing the 27 member states on their policy. Travel restrictions have prevented Emeric Tonri from returning from France to Vietnam where he lives with his wife and their four-year-old daughter. “It’s tragic, I haven’t seen her since December,” said Tonri, who has worked in the southeast Asian country for the past six years. Writer Lucie Azema had been living with her Azerbaijani boyfriend in Iran’s capital Tehran for over a year when the pandemic tore them apart. Since the outbreak, Azema has been stuck in France and her boyfriend in his home country, where he fled to escape the worsening health crisis in Iran. “We’re being worn down, as we can see the situation isn’t getting better and it could well go on for another year,” Azema told AFP. For the past week, Azema has been waiting in Turkey in the hope of a loosening of the restrictions or a loophole that will allow her boyfriend to leave Azerbaijan. But entries and exits from the ex-Soviet state remain strictly prohibited. According to the Love Is Not Tourism movement, only 11 countries allow binational couples to meet up. On Sunday, France became the latest to announce measures to put an end to these couples’ plight. They will be able to apply for a pass to allow their partner to enter France, by presenting documents at their local consulate which prove common activities, their identity, residency in France for one of the two people concerned as well as a return ticket. “This virus doesn’t like love. We do,” the minister in charge of tourism at the French foreign ministry, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, told Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper. Frenchman Fabien Lefebvre, who has not seen his Iranian partner since February, welcomed the measures. “But time is ticking, and the level of tension and despair is already very high,” Lefebvre told AFP. “Many are at their wits’ end. For some, their employers won’t let them leave again after the summer holidays, so they won’t be reunited before Christmas.”  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020

COVID-19 pandemic causing some to have strange and bizarre dreams,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/366138/covid-19-pandemic-causing-some-to-have-strange-and-bizarre-dreams/,"03:17 PM July 13, 2020","SINGAPORE — Concerns over the coronavirus pandemic have found their way into people’s dreams, a development that psychologists say is common around traumatic events. For Ms Gunriddh Sial, it has turned into nightmares. She suffers from trypophobia, a fear of small clustered holes which can induce panic, disgust and anxiety. One night, she woke up abruptly when she dreamt of “a green virus in the form of a human” serving her a slice of pizza. “The virus had small, round holes all over it. I felt very anxious. It was both weird and eerie because I had just discussed eating pizza in a restaurant with my husband that evening,” said Ms Sial, 25, who is doing a master’s degree in supply chain and logistics management. She said it happened two weeks ago after she told her husband, a 32-year-old physicist, she wanted to have pizza in a restaurant. Ms Sial had been looking forward to it after food and beverage businesses were allowed to offer dine-in services from June 19 with safe distancing measures, as Singapore entered phase two of its gradual reopening. Her husband dissuaded her from doing it, saying they should avoid dining out until the Covid-19 situation improved further. That night, she had her strange dream, which she said was all the more scary because the virus was made up of such small holes – “exactly the kind I fear”. Dr Lim Li Ling, a neurologist at the Singapore Neurology and Sleep Centre in Gleneagles Medical Centre, said dreams may reflect the conscious or subconscious stressors, and fears and issues people experience in their waking hours. “These underlying fears may surface during sleep as part of their dreams or nightmares. People who experience traumatic or catastrophic events such as Covid-19 may develop psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety and depression. “As a result, distressing or vivid dreams may be a manifestation of these psychological disturbances,” said Dr Lim, adding that she has seen older patients who have generalized anxiety and poor sleep due to fears of the pandemic and the frustration of having to stay at home. This translation of a traumatic experience into dreams was noted in May by Dr Deirdre Barrett, assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School’s department of psychiatry. Studying the dreams of survivors of the Sept 11, 2011 terror attacks in the United States, she found that bizarre, emotional and vivid dreams tend to increase after a crisis. Ms Sial said she has been waking up intermittently because of stress over the pandemic. “Since the Covid-19 outbreak started here, I’ve had dreams where green objects and creepy-looking bugs were flying around. I don’t know what these dreams mean, but they are disturbing,” she said. While the content and meaning of dreams are not well understood, Dr Lim said during periods of stress, there may be symptoms such as fear, anxiety, depression or exhaustion which lead to a hyper-arousal state mentally. This, in turn, prevents deep and restful sleep, causing one to wake up feeling exhausted. Ms Sial feels her heightened interest in news related to the pandemic around the world has caused her to feel more stressed. “At one point, I deactivated my social media accounts and did not watch the news for a week. It was too overwhelming as everyone was talking about the virus and I needed a breather.” Dr Kenny Pang, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Asia Sleep Centre, said it is believed that during a stressful period in a person’s life, the emotional centre of the brain, called the limbic system, is stimulated and very active. “The limbic system retains some memory of the event. This same area of the brain is also very much involved in the dreaming processes at night. Hence, some scientists believe that after a very stressful period of one’s life, one might have dreams of the events that had occurred previously,” said Dr Pang, who is the founding member of the International Sleep Surgical Society, as well as a member of the World Sleep Society and the Singapore Sleep Society. The myth of “the more I dream, the more tired I am” is not true, he added. “In general, dream sleep is good for the brain. It is a period of rejuvenation and memory rebuilding. The more we dream, the more refreshed we are in the morning.” However, disturbing dreams can cause sleep fragmentation, which may lead to poor sleep quality, said Dr Pang. In March, human resource executive Samantha Ng recalled that she dreamt of hand sanitizers, toilet paper and anti-bacterial soap falling from the sky. “I was standing on a vast plot of land and these items were falling from the sky, so I ran to grab them. I remember feeling happy that nobody was jostling for them with me,” said the 29-year-old with a laugh. Dr Mark Toh, consultant clinical psychologist at Promises Healthcare, said people dream about such items because they represent “perceived solutions to address the threat of being harmed by Covid-19”. He added: “Our psyche is highly concerned about safety and security and, therefore, when a threat is perceived, we consciously and unconsciously move in search of items or avenues that promote and restore our sense of safety.” Undergraduate Sng Ler Jun had a “funny” dream before the circuit breaker was announced in April. The 24-year-old dreamt that he was late for an examination in school and was denied entry because he had forgotten to wear a face mask. “Apparently, the mask was a requirement to take the exam. It was not compulsory to wear masks at that time, so I found it funny that in my dream, it was so important to wear a mask,” he said. He laughed it off, he added. “I didn’t wake up in shock or perspiration. I found it amusing and just brushed it off.” However, there are nights where he stays up worrying about his job prospects. He graduates in December. “I want to be a journalist, but I am worried about getting a job in the post-Covid-19 era. The mild anxiety from this has somewhat affected how early I sleep.” He is taking melatonin gummies to help calm his mind on some nights and promote a healthy sleep cycle. Dr Toh says insomnia is a common occurrence for those who have difficulty sleeping because of worries about employment or their future. To cope with this, he advises people to practice good sleep hygiene such as limiting daytime naps to 30 minutes, avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine before bedtime, and doing regular exercises to promote good-quality sleep. “It is important at this time of disruption and uncertainty during a pandemic that we establish goals to maintain good physical and mental health, consistent with building our resilience to cope with the unrelenting demands of living effectively in the present and in the future,” said Dr Toh. Sleep hygiene is the practice of following simple guidelines to ensure more restful and effective sleep which can promote daytime alertness and help treat or avoid certain kinds of sleep disorders. Trouble sleeping and daytime sleepiness can be indications of poor sleep hygiene. Dr Kenny Pang, a ear, nose and throat specialist at Asia Sleep Center, shares tips on having a good night’s sleep. 1. Go to bed at the same time each day. This will allow your mind and body a chance to rest regularly and at a fixed scheduled time. Avoid tricking your body as it is sensitive to light exposure and changes in times. 2. Get regular exercise each day, preferably in the morning. There is good evidence regular exercise improves restful sleep. This includes stretching, aerobic exercise, meditation and yoga. 3. Get regular exposure to outdoor or bright lights in the day. This allows the mind and body to be aware of day and night, as melatonin is produced during the night. 4. Keep the temperature in the bedroom cool and comfortable. You will not be able to sleep well if you are perspiring . It should not be too cold as well. 5. Keep the bedroom quiet when asleep, as a noisy environment might keep you awake. Your bed partner should preferably not be a snorer. The spouse of a snorer has been shown to sleep an average of two hours less in terms of quantity when compared with one whose bed partner does not snore. 6. Keep the bedroom dark enough to facilitate sleep. Melatonin levels in the blood start to rise by about 9 to 10pm and peaks by 1 to 2am. It helps to have a dark environment for sleeping. 7. Keep your feet and hands warm. Wear warm socks, mittens or gloves to bed. 1. Exercise three to four hours before going to bed. The heart rate and adrenaline levels in the blood needs some time to slow down. 2. Engage in stimulating activity just before bed. This includes playing a competitive game, watching an exciting show or movie, or having an important or heated discussion with a loved one. You should also avoid surfing the Internet just before sleeping. 3. Have caffeine such as coffee, tea, soda and chocolate in the evening. They contain stimulants that might keep you awake at night. 4. Read or watch television in bed. The bed is meant only for sleep and sex. 5. Go to bed too hungry or too full. You will not be able to sleep when you are hungry, as gastric pain might keep you awake. On the other hand, a full stomach will promote reflux disease and cause chest discomfort. 6. Take daytime naps if you have any form of insomnia or sleeplessness. The guilt of sleeping in the afternoon may keep you up at night. 7. Command yourself to go to sleep. This only makes your mind and body more alert.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
‘I got rid of half of my closet’: Heart Evangelista on how she mastered the ‘art of letting go’ in quarantine,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/365731/i-got-rid-of-half-of-my-closet-heart-evangelista-on-how-she-mastered-the-art-of-letting-go-in-quarantine/,"07:25 PM July 07, 2020","If there’s one thing that Heart Evangelista learned while in quarantine, it is the art of getting rid of some things in her life, whether this was stress or material possessions. Heart, along with Iza Calzado, Glaiza de Castro and Max Eigenmann were asked by YouTube vlogger Denise Mallabo on the skills they had mastered during the lockdown in the episode titled “Drinks with the GCQ”.  The four were asked, “What skill have you perfected during this quarantine?” “The art of letting go,” Evangelista immediately quipped. “Yeah, because ano ako, with material, with emotions, with all of that, ano kasi, makimkim ako, eh. Parang I keep everything, ‘yung love, ‘yung pressure,” she said. (Yeah, because I hold on to materials, emotions. I keep everything, even love and pressure.) Relating that she already had “bad anxiety” before the lockdown, she shared how she developed “burning mouth syndrome.” “Your tongue is burning, your palate is burning and there’s no cure,” she said. “I went to seven doctors and I had numb hands, numb feet because parang masyado akong nape-pressure sa lahat (I felt I was too pressured by everything).” During the lockdown, Evangelista said mental health became more of a priority. “Although I would still deal with pressure during the lockdown, but because I felt that I had to survive, parang my mental health is so important,” she said. “Parang iyon na ang kayamanan (It’s like that is the treasure), peace of mind.” With that, she “had to master the art of letting go.” “So I let go of any kind of stress, any kind of pain and I just lift it up,” she said. “I also mastered, you know, letting go of my old stuff, re-purposing it for… a better cause. And I don’t need so many things,” she explained. Going through this process, Evangelista let go of some of her luxurious possessions. “So, I got rid of half of my closet and I feel good about that,” she revealed. “Ang sarap ng feeling na gumaan ‘yung buhay ko. (It’s good to feel that my life has become lighter).” “So for me, I think the lockdown, it’s sad that everything is happening but then again there is a purpose for everything,” she mused. “And I feel for people that are struggling with certain issues, we needed that pause in life and I really feel that, I feel like I relaunched the new me during this lockdown and a big part of it was the art of letting go.” That said, Calzado could only agree. “That’s wonderful, Heart,” she said. Calzado also shared her own thoughts on Evangelista’s realizations. “It’s right. In life you know we have to let go of things that no longer serve us… relationships, things that no longer serve us,” she said. “They may have served us before, you know, you can’t discount that there was a purpose before, but if it no longer serves you then let go.” NVG RELATED STORIES: ‘Darling, don’t look down’: Aiko Melendez lambasts vlogger-influencer who belittled trike driver Heart, Chiz open up on concerns with anti-terror bill, coping with online hate  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020

ASK A DERMA: How stress stirs up zits,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/362372/beauty-check-how-stress-stirs-up-zits/,"10:09 PM May 13, 2020","You’re not going mad. The stress over our current crisis isn’t just taking a toll on your mental health. It’s also why you have unwanted visitors to your face. Pimples never observe social distancing. Almost two months after enjoying virtually-pimple-free skin thanks to two sessions of Remedy’s Hollywood Laser Facial long before the lockdown, I noticed zits started sprouting. I had some on my chin and three on the lower part of my cheeks. I buzzed up Remedy immediately to avail of their online consultation service. If you’re new to Remedy, just send them a direct message to schedule an appointment or to learn more about what they can offer you. Dr. April Geraldez-Rivera of Remedy confirms that stress, which is at an all-time high even if you’re safe at home, is causing a hormonal imbalance. Cortisol, the hormone responsible for your brain’s alarm system, is over-active these days. Pair that with the hormonal see-saw, your oil production increases and you’re more prone to inflammation. Not to mention you’ve got another hormone, adrenaline, that keeps you up until early morning, making it all the more perfect for a to pimple manifest. If you’re acne-prone, you’ll likely see more zits than usual. The lucky ones who have good skin might also be surprised by a zit or two. I asked if there’s a way around it. Dr. April says you need to learn how to avoid exacerbating the stress. Otherwise, you’re regimen, no matter how expertly-prescribed or formulated, can only go so far. Minimize your stress with small adjustments. Limit social media consumption to certain hours of the day. Be discerning of your news updates. You don’t need to know every single news item about COVID-19, and it’s impossible to do so. Stick to the essential data. Switch off your screens an hour before bedtime. Take it a step further with breathing exercises, meditation, or some beginner’s yoga. I always concentrate on a task that doesn’t involve a gadget such as decluttering. Don’t give up hope, though, if you’re struggling with stress management. Take it a step at a time. Don’t let it dishearten you from keeping a disciplined skincare regimen. In my case, Dr. April reminded me of the value of sunblock, even if we’re mostly indoors. I also apply only the necessary products to my face. Acne-prone skin responds to a “less is more” philosophy. I’ve skipped out on moisturizers, serums, and facial oils. Oh, and be strict about using your mask. Use it only when necessary. If you have sensitive skin like me, the contact of the mask to the skin triggers spots. Bummer! But since masks are indispensable, always wash your face with a gentle cleanser when you get home from your grocery run.

"Pronti, Partenza, Via!",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/358120/pronti-partenza-via/,"03:58 PM February 26, 2020","The first-ever scooter run of its kind; organised by premium Italian watch brand, D1 Milano, the Italian Scooter Run is truly one of the must-see events of the year. This event aims to showcase an entertaining mix of classical elements that embody the Italian lifestyle – scooters, coffee, and watches.  The initial leg of the inaugural Italian Scooter Run was held on February 16th at 6:00 a.m., starting from Moto Italia Greenhills to The Refined in BGC. Over a hundred riders eagerly joined in the experience, including television hosts Kuya Kim Atienza, Jay Taruc of Ride PH, and Mark Laccay of the Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride. After the proceedings, all participants gathered together to enjoy a hearty breakfast spread and specially brewed coffee; complimentary of Coffee Lab. By bringing riders from various motorcycle and scooter clubs across the Philippines together, the Italian Scooter Run ultimately creates opportunities for like-minded individuals to not only share their love for bikes, but also help in generously contributing in relief efforts for local residents affected by the Taal Volcano eruption and other recent natural calamities. Moreover, this event also aims to educate riders and motorists about the important of safe and accident-free driving.  The Italian Scooter Run marks the first instalment in a series of upcoming Italian motorcycle-related events for the Philippine market. Up next will be the Italian Bike Run, which instead centres on the heavy-duty Italian motorbikes, and is set to take place later this year. D1 Milano is definitely no stranger to the motorcycle industry, in fact the brand was an avid supporter of Ride PH’s – Moto Heritage Weekend 2019, as shown through its engagement in last year’s Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride – a global fundraising event for men’s prostate cancer research and mental health programs. D1 Milano indeed plans to carry on this initiative by participating in the Ride PH Café occurring on March 9th, along with the upcoming Distinguished Gentleman Ride 2020. From Italian culture, architecture, arts, family, cuisine, coffee, fashion, and accessories, D1 Milano proudly promotes its Italian heritage with a unique touch of finesse, boldness and character that is appreciated by many, and perfectly expressed through its tagline, Wear Your Attitude.

The brand has received well praises locally, and continues to eagerly draw in more clients each day, due to its high-quality and stylish lineup of premium watches. On that account, D1 Milano recently opened a new mono-brand store located on the second floor of Ayala Manila Bay Mall, with hopes to further expand the brand’s reach, as well as better serve the growing demand from old and new customers.

Bong Joon-ho: South Korea’s boundary-pushing satirist,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/357067/bong-joon-ho-south-koreas-boundary-pushing-satirist/,"02:21 PM February 10, 2020","by Claire LEE South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho has been on quite a wild ride this awards season. That trip reached its climax Sunday when he made history with “Parasite,” the first non-English-language film ever to win the best picture Oscar. The film, a vicious satire about the widening gap between rich and poor, took home four Academy Awards — for best picture, best director, best original screenplay and best international feature after winning the Palme d’Or at Cannes, a Golden Globe and two Baftas. “We never write to represent our countries,” said the 50-year-old Bong. “But this is (the) very first Oscar to South Korea. Thank you.” Later, as he accepted the prize for the best international feature, he said in English, eliciting laughs from the audience: “Yeah, I’m ready to drink tonight.” As the night wore on and “Parasite” kept collecting awards, Bong was overcome. “It’s very hard to believe. It’s such a great honor,” he said backstage. Bong — who is known for his dark and genre-hopping thrillers — already had a series of critical and commercial hits behind him before “Parasite” and is one of South Korea’s best-known faces. His triumph on Hollywood’s biggest night should take him to new heights. The significance of Bong’s win “cannot be underestimated both for Korean cinema and non-English language cinema as a whole,” Jason Bechervaise, a professor at Korea Soongsil Cyber University, told AFP. “It will obviously go down in the history books.” Bong grew up in an elite artistic family in Seoul — his maternal grandfather was a renowned novelist while his late father and all of his siblings are university professors in fields including fashion and fine art. He studied sociology at the South’s prestigious Yonsei University and reportedly took part in street protests while enrolled there during the country’s pro-democracy movement in the 1980s. Bong once told an interviewer he had been arrested for using petrol bombs. He was among the first wave of South Korean filmmakers to blossom after the country’s full democratization, which opened the door for a cultural renaissance. His “Memories of Murder” — a 2003 feature film based on real-life serial killings that rattled the nation in the 1980s — was seen as a metaphor for a repressive society under military rule. Bong’s 2006 monster blockbuster “The Host” portrayed an incompetent government left helpless in the wake of a disaster. In 2014, parallels were drawn between the film and the Sewol ferry sinking that killed 300, mostly schoolchildren. His 2013 “Snowpiercer” depicted a dystopian future in which the last humans on Earth — who survived a failed attempt to stop global warming — travel endlessly on a train separated according to class and the lower class revolts. Tilda Swinton, who was in “Snowpiercer,” also starred in Bong’s Netflix-produced 2017 sci-fi action-adventure “Okja” about a country girl trying to save a genetically-engineered beast from a greedy multinational firm. Quentin Tarantino — whose “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood” won two Oscars on Sunday — once likened the South Korean to “Steven Spielberg in his prime”. Bong is “not a filmmaker who has come out of nowhere, he’s been an established director for close to 20 years and has made exceptional films,” Bechervaise told AFP. “He’s also very charming and sociable. This has been a factor, I think, in how far the film has gone having done hundreds of interviews, possibly more, and mingling with voters and the Hollywood elite.” Throughout his career, Bong has often tackled dark and difficult subjects including violent crime, systematic oppression, and the climate crisis. He also has candidly spoken about dealing with severe anxiety, in a country where mental health has long been a taboo topic. “All his films are sociology-in-motion, and all his films have a political subtext,” said Michael Hurt, a sociologist at the University of Seoul. “They’re all deeply inoculated with socially critical, political thought, without being preachy or obvious about it. Few other directors can do this.”  Photo courtesy of Agence France-Presse  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER. Prove your humanity",2020

Do your own BTS tour of Seoul—it’s a great time to be Army,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/356224/do-your-own-bts-tour-of-seoul-its-a-great-time-to-be-army/,"07:18 PM January 27, 2020","Who would’ve thought that when it debuted in 2013, Bangtan Sonyeondan, or BTS—comprised of Kim Namjoon (RM), Kim Seokjin (Jin), Min Yoongi (Suga), Jung Hoseok (J-Hope), Park Jimin (Jimin), Kim Taehyung (V), and Jeon Jeongguk (Jungkook) —had to fight for its place in the crowded K-pop industry? But BTS’ fans, collectively known as Armys, have always believed in the boys. Today, BTS members are global superstars who have transcended the boy band image to become innovative, daring and revolutionary artists —with a following that’s exponentially growing the world over. (Watch the group at the Grammy Awards on Jan. 27.) They constantly surprise and excite Armys with their projects and performances, never shortchanging their global audience. And it’s fascinating how the bigger BTS gets, the more intimate its relationship becomes with fans. The boys reach out to Armys whenever they could, spending time on Weverse, a Twitter-like platform, and V-Live, a streaming service, for real-time conversations. “Army” is part of the boys’ daily vocabulary. Armys’ formidable might keeps BTS on top so that even the group’s impact on South Korea’s economy has become significant. The think-tank Hyundai Research Institute regularly monitors the BTS effect. In 2017, the institute said that one in every 13 tourists went to South Korea because of BTS. In June 2019, it reported that revenues from the foreign fans’ BTS destination tour have an estimated economic impact of 4.14 trillion won. According to the institute, BTS’ three-day “Love Yourself, Speak Yourself” concert finale in Seoul last October had 1 trillion won ($860.7 million) worth of direct and indirect economic impact on South Korea. BTS is an exciting world because Armys never know what the band’s got up its sleeves. Its new album, “Map of the Soul (MOTS):7,” due for release on Feb. 21, completes the septet’s Jungian-inspired musical narrative. The singles “Shadow” and “Black Swan” are introspective and cutting-edge. The group also introduced “Connect, BTS” which combines contemporary art and music, as part of its pre-album launch activities. Incidentally, “MOTS:7” has sold a record 3.42 million stock preorders in its first week of availability, according to a Forbes.com report. With BTS now commanding the world stage, it will be a sentimental hometown pilgrimage for Armys who have loved the group since day 1 and for those who recently fell into the rabbit hole, as it were, and have no plans of getting out. Sentimental pilgrimage You can do this BTS tour of South Korea: Nonhyeon-ro 145-gil in Gangnam-gu Subway: Hakdong Station, Exit 7 Although Big Hit’s founder, Bang Si Hyuk, is a recognized songwriter and hitmaker, his company, when he started, was nothing compared to the agencies that ruled the K-pop industry. Big Hit used to rent a floor for its office, and another floor for BTS’ dormitory, where its members shared a single room in this nondescript building in Gangnam. It looked like a deserted property when we visited, except that fans milled about and every inch of the building’s walls, railings and stairs, are covered with Armys’ messages of love and support for BTS and Big Hit. From its current second address, Big Hit is reportedly moving this year to a bigger and swankier building where the company will occupy several floors to accommodate its growing enterprise. 14 Dosan-daero 28-gil, Nonhyeon-dong, Gangnam-gu Subway: Hakdong Station, Exit 7 Less than five minutes away by foot from the old Big Hit building is Yoojung Sikdang, the Bangtan boys’ favorite restaurant when they were trainees. Imagine seven lanky boys, barely out of their teens, walking to the neighborhood restaurant after a long, grueling rehearsal. (These days, BTS could no longer walk the streets without any security or manager in tow.) Yoojung Sikdang, decorated floor to ceiling with BTS memorabilia, has traditional and affordable Korean fare such as hot pot bibimbap, grilled pork belly and vegetable wrap, and sausage stew. We’re not sure if the nice lady who showed us the boys’ favorites on the menu was the restaurant owner, but nonetheless she has fond memories of Bangtan. She showed us their favorite table, their seating arrangement marked with stickers. She said they were handsome, polite and kind. We asked if their long-time, extremely good-looking manager, Sejin, also went there and she laughed, nodding her head. Loved by the boys, Sejin has become a celebrity among Armys. Filming location 22 Bongeunsa-ro 4-gil, Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu Subway: Sinnonhyeon Station, Exit 5 This is a place for pizza lovers and K-pop fans. Laundry Pizza is a favorite filming location for K-pop groups. The interior is like a laundromat with a row of laundry machine lids on one side of the room. The place, which has a ’70s bistro vibe, was the shooting location for BTS’ “Love Yourself: Her,” a nine-track album which made a historic debut on record charts in South Korea, Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom, and made impressive rankings on record charts across continents. 25 Olympic-ro, Jamsil 2(i)-dong, Songpa-gu Subway: Sports Complex Station BTS’ highly successful “Love Yourself: Speak Yourself” concert tour wrapped up at the Jamsil Stadium. My friend Camille and I watched on the second day of the three-day finale. It was my first-ever stadium concert, and while I could barely see the boys on stage, their songs, energy, and the state-of-the-art production gave an unforgettable thrill. Jamsil’s main stadium was built in 1988 for the Summer Olympics. Since then, several legendary acts like Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson had performed here. But certainly, its most significant artists are its own South Korean trailblazers, like musical genius Seo Taiji, whose Seo Taiji and Boys are credited for laying the foundation of K-pop. The Bangtan boys have their copper handprints mounted along with those of Seo Taiji, on a display board in the stadium grounds. From Apgujeong Rodeo Station to Cheongdam Intersection Subway: Apgujeongrodeo Station, Exit 2 BTS is among the 17 K-pop groups that have “Gangnamdol” (portmanteau of Gangnam, idol, and doll) bears along the K-Star Road in the upscale neighborhood of Gangnam. Supposedly, a band gets to have a bear on K-Star Road depending on its chart sales and popularity abroad, among other criteria. BTS’ message of self-love and social awareness was among the reasons they gained fans around the world. In the songs, listeners found meaning and relevance that cut across race, belief, gender identity and age. But the message is most striking among today’s youth who deal with bullying, violence and mental health issues. BTS has partnered with Unicef for its youth empowerment campaign, and in September 2018, the group became the first Korean band to appear at the United Nations General Assembly, where band leader RM spoke on the group’s behalf. 1F, Main Branch of Lotte Department Store, 30, Euljiro, Jung-gu, Seoul Subway: Euljiro 1-ga (Line 2) BTS is among the Lotte Duty Free celebrity endorsers featured in a “star avenue” at the Lotte Department Store’s main branch, near the famous Myeongdong shopping district. The Bangtan boys also have their handprints here. We hope that its interactive video and commercial film will still be at the tunnel for Armys to enjoy this year. With its undeniable selling power, BTS has become brand ambassadors for several Korean products—from high-end vehicles to sportswear, face masks to vitamins. While the boys do have a taste for foreign luxury brands, they unabashedly love their own, wearing local brands and modernized versions of the hanbok. In their reality shows, the boys always crave for Korean food, and they’d have casual musings about home whenever they are overseas. In 2018, BTS became the youngest recipient of South Korea’s Hwagwan Order of Cultural Merit. Branches all over Seoul BTS created BT21 in 2017 in partnership with Naver’s Line Friends. We went to the different Line Stores in Seoul (.ie., Gangnam, Itaewon, Hongdae, Myeongdong, Insadong, YP Books at Coex) because the BT21 characters and merchandise are unbelievably cute, though pricey. The attraction of BT21 for Armys is, the characters are the members’ alter egos—Koya (RM), RJ (Jin), Shooky (Suga), Mang (J-Hope), Chimmy (Jimin), Tata (V) and Cooky (Jungkook). There are also BT21 cafés in some of the bigger Line stores where fans can hang out. BT21 has 5.1 million followers on Twitter and 2.54 million YouTube subscribers. A YouTube animated episode of Chimmy’s backstory, where he was abandoned as a baby and found a friend in Tata, had Armys in tears just before Christmas. Armys joke that if BT21 released an album, it just might join BTS on the record charts. Steam cooking 30 Baekjegobun-ro 45-gil, Songpa 1(il)-dong, Songpa-gu Subway: Jamsil Station, Exit 10; or Seokchon Station, Exit 2 Fans predict that Jin will be Bang PD-nim’s successor at Big Hit because of his business savvy, earning him the moniker “Jin Hit Entertainment”. Jin and his brother opened Ossu Seiromushi, a Japanese restaurant where Armys can experience the Japanese seiromushi method of steam cooking in bamboo trays. We got a taste of the sweetest vegetables and the most tender meat, and the serving was large enough for four people. I went there with my friends Kel and Lai a week after the concert, when the other customers in the cozy restaurant were still predominantly Armys . When you’re at Ossu, make sure to look at the top shelves by the cashier. You’ll see a row of comic book heroes collectibles. Those on display might just be Jin’s. 149 Dasan-ro, Jung-gu Subway: Yaksu Station, Exit 2 Aside from being on Seoul’s Michelin Guide, Geumdwaeji (or Golden Pig) Sikdang is also Jimin and Jungkook approved. According to the Michelin Guide, the place serves “fine cuts of YBD pig, a cross breed between Yorkshire, Berkshire and Duroc.” Jimin and Jungkook would eat on the third floor of the restaurant, where the sunroof has a nice view of the neighborhood. Fans can ask the staff to see the menu signed by the two BTS members. Hannamdong Shinseong Miso City 39 Dokseodang-ro, Yongsan-gu Subway: Hannam Station, Exit 1 The Run BTS series is a reality show where the boys face challenges, all while letting their hair down and being their playful 20-something selves. In Run episode 45, BTS tried its hand at being baristas for a day at the &Gather Café. One of Korea’s top ranked baristas gave the boys a crash course on coffee-making, taught them how to make espresso and latte, and helped them make their signature coffees. You can try the BTS concoctions here: Rosy Latte by Jin; Creamy Latte by Jimin; Injeolmi Latte by V; Shakerator by RM; Coco-presso by J-Hope; Espresso Berry Latte by Jungkook; and Suga’s Iced Lemony Coke (Café Lemoni in the show). 31-9 Jamwon-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul Subway: Sinsa Station (Line 3), Exit 4 “I’m Fine” is one of BTS’ songs in its bestselling “Love Yourself: Answer” album. It’s said that the song is a response to one of the band’s earlier hits, the heart-wrenching “Save ME,” which is part of “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever” album, released in 2016. The café recently opened, and the owner’s favorite member is Jin. While photos of Worldwide Handsome (the nickname funnyman Jin gave himself) dominate the café’s walls, there are also many pictures and memorabilia of the other six members. Those who come to this bright and cozy café can watch countless BTS videos on a video wall projector or talk endlessly about the Bangtan boys, while having coffee, tea or juice and cakes. It’s definitely a place where Armys can be happy and feel just fine.

"Queen, Prince Harry, senior royals set for crisis meeting",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/355293/queen-prince-harry-senior-royals-set-for-crisis-meeting/,"01:48 PM January 12, 2020","London, United Kingdom | AFP | Saturday 1/12/2020 – 07:00 UTC+8  Queen Elizabeth II will host a showdown meeting with Prince Harry on Monday in an attempt to solve the crisis triggered by his bombshell announcement that he and wife Meghan were stepping back from the royal frontline.  Other senior royals including Harry’s father Prince Charles and brother Prince William, with whom he has strained relations, will join the monarch at her private Sandringham estate in eastern England, according to British media.  Meghan will join the meeting via conference call from Canada as they attempt to work out the “next steps” towards a compromise and nip the growing crisis in the bud.  Issues up for debate include how much money the couple will still receive from Charles’s estate, their HRH titles and what commercial deals they can strike, according to the Sunday Times.  Harry, Meghan and son Archie spent Christmas in Canada, with the US former actress returning there this week.  The Queen on Thursday demanded that staff work with the couple to urgently find a “workable solution” that would take into account their demands for more freedom.  Several Canadian media reported Meghan had returned to Vancouver island off the country’s Pacific coast, where the family spent the year-end holidays and where baby Archie had remained with his nanny.  Senior royals were caught off guard by Wednesday’s announcement that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex wanted to seek a “progressive new role” and divide their time between Britain and North America.  The Queen’s office issued a terse statement the same evening, saying there were “complicated issues that will take time to work through”.  Harry and Meghan said they intended to continue to “fully support” the queen and “collaborate” with senior royals.  They also want to keep their home on the queen’s Windsor Castle estate as their British base, while aiming to become financially independent.  The younger prince, who has struggled with his role, last year revealed he has been growing apart from his brother, who was second in line to the throne is increasingly pursuing a different path.  Harry has been open about his mental health issues and he and Meghan last year admitted to struggling with the spotlight following their wedding at Windsor Castle in May 2018 and Archie’s birth a year later.

5 Things Every Girl with Low Self-Esteem Needs to Hear,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/349507/5-things-every-girl-with-low-self-esteem-needs-to-hear/,"01:17 PM October 30, 2019"," There are days when we’re at our best both physically and mentally—days when we’re just feeling ourselves, and when we feel like our confidence is through the roof. These are our good days—but unfortunately, it can’t all be good days. At any given time, we can feel insecure, anxious, or even angry about ourselves. Whether it’s about the way we look, how we speak, our skills or talents, our family and friends, our grades, career, or status, everything makes an impact on our self-esteem. Self-esteem, or a person’s sense of their own worth or value, is affected by both internal and external factors. And while for some, self-esteem might dip a few notches down on bad days, there are others who face crippling self-esteem issues on a daily basis—for them, every day is a bad day. Low self-esteem can not only dampen relationships, but also damage your sense of self permanently. If you are, or know someone, with low self-esteem, here are a few things you might need to hear: It’s not a competition. There’s a reason self-esteem issues commonly start to form once you hit puberty. This is the age we become more aware of our surroundings and peers, and start to feel the pressure to conform to certain standards. Think of this phase as your awkward years. Comparison is the root of self-doubt. Especially now that we’re always bombarded with images of what we should look like and the things we should have, we tend to base our self-perception on other people. Social media can heavily contribute to making us feel like everything is a competition—but you should know that it’s not. What’s important is to pay attention to your own story and look straight ahead instead of sideways. It is easier said than done, but you must learn to appreciate what you have instead of focusing on what you don’t. Remember, it’s okay to move and take on life at your own pace. After all, everyone’s story is different. It’s okay to be critical. You should be more critical about the things around you. Question why certain looks, features, shapes, or sizes are considered beautiful. Question the images and advertisements you encounter every day. Think about how women are portrayed in the media. Question everything—but the one thing you shouldn’t be overcritical about is yourself. Don’t fixate on your flaws; instead, list down your assets and repeat them to yourself. Especially when under stress, remember to go easy on yourself and show yourself  a little kindness. It’s okay to talk about it.  You probably feel like you need to put a brave face on, but being open about your fears and insecurities is a step toward overcoming your self-esteem issues. Though it may be scary, more so because self-esteem is inextricably linked to mental health, opening up to others, especially those who might be going through similar things, will help you feel like you’re less alone facing the problem. You are valid and enough. Sometimes, all we need is to know that we are enough. If we have that inner sense of worth, we wouldn’t need to constantly seek external validation. It would be much easier to be confident about ourselves, whether it’s about the color of our skin, our size, our opinions. Make sure to tell yourself: whatever you are is enough. You are unique and valuable. You should be your own advocate. Rather than being your own worst critic, you should be your own best advocate. This is the best way to take control of your life and fight toward a healthy sense of self, allowing you to build healthy relationships both with others and your own self.This means not only fully embracing who you are, but also surrounding yourself with what is empowering. Accept that you are beautiful on your own terms. Finally, be a source of empowerment and a positive force for others who might be dealing with the same issues. Dove is helping girls everywhere forge an empowering community, where every girl is a #ConfidentGirl. By encouraging young girls to define beauty in their own terms, Dove is championing the self-worth of millions around the world. The Dove Self-Esteem Project, currently present in 139 countries, aims to help girls build and protect their self-esteem by equipping them with the tools they need, such as workshops and modules.

Acupuncture? Hydrotherapy? Pets in America now get human treatment,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/342141/acupuncture-hydrotherapy-pets-in-america-now-get-human-treatment/,"12:15 PM August 04, 2019","Washington, United States | AFP | Sunday 8/4/2019 – 09:28 UTC+8 By: Delphine Touitou  Eleven-year-old Bess waits patiently to be immersed in water just a little cooler than her body temperature.  Her hydrotherapy session will last only 17 minutes but it does wonders for this arthritis sufferer. Bess is a cat.  To ease her joint pain, the Maine Coon, a touch overweight at 21 pounds (10 kilograms), is taken every week to the Friendship Hospital for Animals, a veterinary clinic on a pleasant Washington street.  Beyond traditional veterinary treatment, the clinic offers forms of care once reserved for humans, such as acupuncture and therapeutic ultrasound.  Pets are now increasingly seen as genuine family members, said Christine Klippen, one of the 63 veterinarians who are available at the clinic every day of the year.  And this is particularly true for millennials, she said, who see themselves as moms and dads to their “fur babies.” Given the higher incomes in the US capital, they often seek out the best pet care available.  In the United States, 84.9 million households, or 68 percent, have a pet, according to Steve King, head of the American Pet Products Association.  “Millennials are the largest pet-owning demographic among all generations,” he said, and have surpassed the postwar Baby Boom generation.  Last year, consumer spending on pets hit a record $72.6 billion and the APPA expects this will rise to $75.4 billion in 2019.  Health care spending is the fastest-rising category as pet owners learn about available treatments.  “There’s less pushback than there was,” said Brant Hassell, a veterinarian practicing at the District Veterinary Hospital.  “These dogs are a lot of people’s first children,” he said.  “If I say, ‘Oh, my goodness. This dog has a loose tooth,’ they’re just like, ‘my baby!'”  Back at Friendship Hospital, Bess the cat walks on an underwater treadmill, the water up to her whiskers, the pace slow and regular as a metronome.  But to keep up, Bella, a “senior” dog, needed a little extra motivation in the form of peanut butter.  “We are more selective with food when they’re overweight,” said Janay Austin-Carlson, a rehabilitation practitioner.  Walking in water creates greater resistance to movement, making exercise more effective.  “One minute in here is much harder than one minute outside,” she said.  Given Washington’s often oppressive summertime heat, where temperatures can easily hit 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius) and humidity rises to 70 percent, the animals can also exercise in relative comfort.  “We can play with the speed, the water level,” said Austin-Carlson. “All those things create different dynamics.”  Bella’s “mom,” 45-year-old Freya Jackson, says hydrotherapy has been a godsend.  “When she comes, she’s usually tired afterwards and needs a long nap. But the day after you can really see she could move around more freely,” said Jackson.  Still, Bella’s fitness regime is not exactly free: A 20-minute hydrotherapy session runs to $89 and comes after 15 minutes of laser therapy at $65.  And Bella has stuck to this weekly routine for a year.  Jackson said having a healthy dog helps her own exercise habits and, given that she has no children, the expense fits her budget.  “I’m investing in myself to stay fit and healthy and be able to run around,” she said. “It is a part of my wellbeing.”  Pet owners are generally healthier people, coping better with conditions such as autism, dementia and cardiovascular disease, according to studies funded by the Human Animal Bond Research Institute.  Having a dog or cat in the house typically lowers blood pressure and children may suffer less frequently from allergies.  Generally pets improve mental health, according to Klippen of the Friendship Hospital.  “Because we view our pets in a more human way it is no longer meaningful enough for us to simply give them a biscuit,” said King of the APPA.  And some pet owners are ready to spare no expense: Dialysis can run between $12,000 and $15,000 while the price tag on orthopedic surgery ranges from $5,000 to $7,000.  But humanizing pets can involve controversial or even dangerous health practices such as needlessly imposing grain or gluten free diets on animals.  This simply does not suit their nutritional needs and can cause premature death, according to Klippen.  In the meantime, US authorities say they have begun scrutinizing potential ties between such popular, newfangled diets and the prevalence of heart disease in dogs.

Tips to make your workout work!,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/341377/tips-to-make-your-workout-work/,"09:06 PM July 25, 2019","Working out by definition means that one expects results—good results. We all have our goals for exercising, but in order to make sure we produce the results we want, we have to make the most of our workouts. Just like any type of work, there is a way to do it in a smart and calculated manner. Here are my top three tips to get the biggest benefit out of every one of your training sessions. Preparation sets you up for success. I consider being fully ready to work out just as important as the workout itself. There are three things I check off to make sure I am ready to get started: rest, nutrition, and workout routine. Being well-rested not only energizes you through every sprint or push-up, but it also keeps your hunger hormones at bay, so you’re not undoing your efforts in the gym by overeating the rest of the day. When you have a full or high body battery, you are more likely to push yourself harder through the session. Next, have a routine prepared even if you’re doing it on your own. Actually, it’s even more important to have a plan when you’re doing it alone, as compared to joining a class. Don’t waste your time with an ineffectual workout or half-hearted commitment. If you don’t know what to do or don’t want to plan, join a group class. It’s also extremely important to be hydrated and fueled for your workout. Although there are cases for fasted workouts, the general rule of thumb is to have some protein and carbohydrates (either a meal or small snack) at least 45 mins to an hour before working out, especially when lifting weights and HIIT. This allows you to have the energy to push yourself and make the most of every rep and sprint. Also, I highly encourage wearing proper active attire. Wearing the right clothes—sweat-wicking and proper fitting—allows you to be comfortable while you exercise. If you’re not comfortable, you’ll be distracted from your routine, and we don’t want that! And, don’t forget to warm up—a dynamic warm-up. This means to warm up through movement. Go through the muscle groups you’re going to use to make sure areas like the shoulders, knees, and wrists will be warm and ready.  Now you’re in the gym and ready to start. Whether you are working out alone or joining a group exercise class, it’s important to come in with focus and determination to make every second count for the next 45 minutes or hour, or however long the session is. A really great tip to keep your eye on the prize is to put away any distractions. I would even put away your phone. The only exception is if you need to use your phone for your workout music or to time your sets. If so, I encourage it. Music is great! With that said, I would put your phone on airplane mode so you’re not disturbed by emails, calls, messages, and social media. Those can all wait. Distractions are put away, and now it’s time to follow the plan either you or a trainer have prepared, or follow an instructor of a class you may have joined. Be present and follow the plan. If you’re training alone, monitor the timing of your reps and your rest in between. Keep your momentum going and focus unwavered. For every exercise move, think of the specific muscle you are working. Focus on engaging that. Being highly focused allows you to be hyper-aware of your body–how it feels and how it’s moving. This allows you to push when you can, and turn it down when needed as well. Another thing I do that helps me a lot is the gym face. The gym face is the face we make when we tense up and push to the fullest and give our all with every move. It is commonly characterized as unpleasant and “ugly” and it can be a bit embarrassing to do at a public place, but I guarantee you, it helps! Believe me–when you are at that last rep and you think you have no more left you to give, throw away poise, scrunch that face, and I bet you, you can do it. Embrace the gym face! You’ve pushed your mind and body to the fullest, congrats! Now it’s time to make sure your body recovers appropriately. If it wasn’t already part of your workout routine, take a few minutes to cool down and stretch. Stretching improves flexibility, releases lactic acid buildup lessening muscle soreness, and allows you to bring your heart rate and breathing back to a normal pace. Next, you need to refuel and do it ideally as soon as you wrap up your routine. The key is to get it in within 30 to 45 minutes—the earlier the better. It’s crucial because you’ve essentially emptied your fuel tank and created micro-tears in your muscles. It is after a tough workout that your body looks for carbohydrates and protein to help replenish glycogen stores and rebuild muscle, so getting your body the nutrition it needs to recover in a timely manner is important. Plus, if you don’t have a proper meal after a workout, the tendency is to be more ravenous later. No one likes to be hangry! Part of refueling is also hydration. Drinking water is an absolute must! In one hour of exercise, the body can lose about a quart of water, depending on the air temperature and exercise intensity. That’s a lot! Getting enough water into our system after a workout helps with muscle recovery, replenishing electrolytes, and nutrient digestion and absorption. So, drink up that H2O! Lastly, make sure to get enough sleep. Anyone who knows me knows that this is one tip that I myself struggle to follow. Although getting sufficient sleep is a no-brainer, it is sometimes the most overlooked when it comes to working out. While we sleep, our body works to repair and restore our muscles, bones, and tissue from the strain we put on them during the day. Recovery is one thing, but good quality sleep also improves physical performance and mental health and hormonal balance. When you give yourself a chance to recover adequately, you are more likely to come back stronger than before! For many years, I worked out to enjoy (Love those endorphins!) and to simply sweat it out. It is fun, therapeutic, and I like the idea of doing something good for myself. This is great and all, but if you’re after some serious, clear-cut goals, like specific weight-loss and muscle gain, I highly recommend having a plan in place. If you’re a newbie to working out, these tips may seem a bit overwhelming. My advice to you is to just get started. Start working out regularly, and incorporate these learnings as you go. Before you know it, it’ll be all routine. As for those working out for a while, if you haven’t already naturally come to learn these tips, I encourage you to apply these little tweaks. I promise you’ll see those results!  Why everyone should lift weights—females too!  What to consume for that energy boost that’s not coffee   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
Why everyone should lift weights—females too!,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/338431/why-everyone-should-lift-weights-females-too/,"10:00 PM June 16, 2019","I recently had a tita of mine tell me to stop lifting weights because I looked “bulky”. Comments like these often evolved into further statements such as “you’re getting too muscular” or “weight training is not very ladylike”. Suggestions like these have led me to believe that there’s still a prevalent stigma around lifting weights, especially pertaining to women. There’s a common misconception that women lifting weights is either not feminine, or that it’s all around bad for you. That couldn’t be more of a lie. In fact, there’s a slew of benefits that comes with weight training. The following are my top ones! It’s quite straightforward—muscle fights fat. And weight training helps you build and strengthen your muscles. Studies have found that the average woman who lifts weights two to three times a week for two months will gain an average of two pounds of muscle and will lose an average of 3.5 pounds of fat. As your lean muscle increases, so does your resting metabolism, and you burn more calories all day long. Lifting lighter weights for more reps is great for building muscle endurance, but if you want to increase your strength, increasing your weight is key. If you consistently weight train two to three times a week, you’ll be amazed at how fast you’ll build strength. Even better, you’ll see that translate in everyday activities. Carrying groceries, pushing open a heavy door, and even hoisting a child in the air will become easier—you’ll feel like an everyday superhero! Unlike men, women typically don’t gain size from weight training. Women have 10 to 30 times less of the hormones as compared to men that is required for a drastic increase in muscle size. You will, however, develop muscle tone and definition, and this is an awesome bonus. So, for the titas out there who think lifting weights will make your nieces overly rippled with large muscles, be rest assured that this is not true. As you age, you naturally lose muscle and bone mass. This is of serious concern for women, whose bones are smaller to begin with and can become dangerously weakened by age. Lifting weights can actually help fight this, since weight training can increase spinal bone density. This, along with an adequate amount of dietary calcium, can be a woman’s best defense against osteoporosis. According to studies, lifting weights for just less than an hour a week may reduce your risk for a heart attack or stroke by 40 to 70 percent. In addition to staving off cardiovascular disease, weightlifting has also been discovered to prevent high cholesterol and diabetes. These are ranked among the top causes of death in the world. Imagine if we could get everyone to lift some weights? You will feel stronger and more confident—two very essential traits of a resilient and steadfast mind. Just like any form of exercise, weight training can enhance your mood by releasing feel-good hormones called endorphins. Endorphins are neurotransmitters that prevent pain, improve mood, and fight depression. An increase in endorphins naturally reduces stress and anxiety. When I first seriously started committing to a highly-active lifestyle back in 2013, I ran marathons and was under the impression that the only way I could stay lean and fit was through cardio. Boy, was I wrong. Although cardio has its own list of benefits, nothing has transformed my mind and body quite like weight training has. Not only am I in the best shape of my life at 33 years old, but I also find myself happier with my lifestyle and my mind even sharper. I don’t regret running marathons, and I still find joy in occasionally competing in obstacle competitions—think American Ninja Warrior. But as for my life-long, sustainable routine, you’ll find me at the gym lifting weights on a regular basis. Can you blame me with all those great advantages?!

Prince Harry: troubled playboy to happy family man,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/334444/prince-harry-troubled-playboy-to-happy-family-man/,"06:15 PM May 07, 2019","By: Alice Ritchie via Agence France-Presse  Prince Harry, who became the father of a “very healthy boy” on Monday, has transformed himself from an angry young man into one of the British royal family’s greatest assets.  The younger son of the heir to the throne Prince Charles and the late Diana, princess of Wales, Harry, now 34, struggled with his role and for much of his youth seemed to want nothing more than to escape.  But now, for all his wild child ways, he seems ready to enjoy the settled, stable family life he always craved, with his wife Meghan, the new baby and a new home.  “Mother and baby are doing incredibly well. It’s been the most amazing experience I can ever possibly imagine,”  a beaming Harry announced in a statement to television cameras.  The Duke of Sussex, who spent 10 years in the British army, serving two tours of duty in Afghanistan, hit the headlines for his partying and his outspoken criticism of the media.  The prince rebuilt his reputation through his charity work with veterans, advocacy on mental health and by taking on more duties from his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II.  He appears to have inherited his late mother’s ability to connect with people — as well as her sense of mischief — and, with Meghan, his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate, has helped put a fresh face on the monarchy.  Harry, now sixth in line to the throne, has said that Diana is always in his thoughts, and has championed many of her charitable causes, including taking an HIV test to raise awareness.  But he revealed that for a long time he struggled to cope with his mother’s death in a Paris car crash in 1997, and sought professional help a few years ago.  In a remarkably candid interview, the prince once admitted he came “very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions.”  He turned a corner and in July 2016 met Meghan Markle, a US television actress, on a blind date set up by a mutual friend. Their transatlantic romance quickly blossomed.  Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales was born on September 15, 1984, the “spare” to his brother William, who is one day set to inherit the throne.  Both educated at the elite Eton school, their childhood was dominated by the messy breakdown of their parents’ marriage and Diana’s tragic death.  The young princes walking behind her coffin — Harry only 12, his brother 15 — was one of the most enduring images of Diana’s funeral.  “Losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but also my work as well,” Harry said.  At one point, he seemed the archetypal “playboy prince,” regularly photographed looking worse for wear and often accompanied by an attractive girl.  He caused outrage in 2005 when photographs of him in a Nazi Afrika Korps fancy dress outfit made front-page news.  That was the year he entered the army, a conventional path for royals and one that he later admitted “was the best escape I’ve ever had” from the constant public attention.  In 2008, he had to be pulled out of Afghanistan after a news blackout about his deployment was breached, leading to fears he would be targeted by the Taliban.  But he returned in 2012, piloting Apache helicopters during a 20-week tour of duty — only to make headlines again when he said his job was to take insurgents “out of the game.”  He left the military in 2015 rather than take an army desk job, and began to focus on royal duties.  The meeting with Meghan in July 2016 came out of the blue, but both were quickly lovestruck. They bonded over their mutual interest in good causes.  Harry has used his public profile to promote causes close to his heart, including mental health and youth empowerment.  He has set up the Invictus Games, a sports championship for wounded military personnel, which has been held in London, Orlando, Toronto and Sydney.  Harry and Meghan married at Saint George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle on May 19 last year and they toured the Pacific around the Sydney Games in October.  They are moving from their small cottage on the grounds of London’s Kensington Palace into a much larger one on the Windsor estate outside the city as they start their new life as parents.  As ever, Harry is going his own way.   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
Pinoy global king was not sure about winning,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/334430/pinoy-global-king-was-not-sure-about-winning/,"01:30 PM May 07, 2019","    PASAY CITY—Janjep Carlos admitted he had wanted to become Mister Gay World since first joining the national search three years ago. But even after all of his preparations leading to his eventual coronation in March as the Philippines’ representative to the international contest for gay men, he said there came no point in the global competition that he knew he had the title in the bag.  “Even when I was announced in the Top 5, and there were only two of us left on stage, I didn’t think I was the one,” Carlos told the Inquirer upon his arrival at the Terminal 3 of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Pasay City on Monday evening.  Carlos competed against 21 other delegates from around the world in South Africa for the 11th edition of the Mister Gay World pageant. He became the second Filipino and Asian to bag the crown, following Baguio City native John Raspado’s historic victory in 2016.  Both Carlos and Raspado competed in the national tilt in 2017, but Carlos only finished in the Top 10.  For Carlos, an entrepreneur from Cavite who distributes beauty supplements, finally bagging the Mister Gay World title is a fulfillment of his dream, and he had everything planned to make sure he had all bases covered.  “I’ve been physically fit even before I joined the national pageant, so what we had to focus on was my walk. It was the most difficult part of my training under Tito Rodgil (Flores), but it was also the most useful for me,” he shared.  Carlos bagged to Best in National Costume award in South Africa, using the same Sarimanok-inspired number which also won him the same award in the national pageant.  Flores, head of the beauty pageant training camp “Kagandahang Flores,” also disclosed to the Inquirer that Carlos topped the written examination portion of the global tilt.  “We really researched, and equipped him with all the knowledge he would need,” Flores said.  For Carlos, the victory is not just his, but also the community’s.  “I’m sharing this with my family, my partner and my supporters, and also with the LGBT community to give them a positive representation of the community,” he explained.  Aside from working on LGBT causes, Carlos also hopes to use his international title as a platform to spread awareness on mental health care.  Even before flying for his international competition, Carlos had already visited Cape Town in South Africa to work with a mental health care group. Also, he was able to establish connections with the group Mental Health PH to further promote his cause in the Philippines.  As of the moment, Carlos has not been informed yet of any immediate activity with the global organization. But he said the group has a lot planned for him.  “I will be very busy with a lot of travelling working with the Mister Gay World organization, spreading awareness on HIV-AIDS and participating in pride events,” he shared.  While here in the Philippines, Carlos said he will take advantage of this break to share his victory with his loved ones and his supporters.  His team also told the Inquirer that a homecoming activity is being planned in his home town of General Trias in Cavite, where a charity event will also be included. /jpv  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
Pageant veteran bags Mr. Gay World PH title,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/330056/pageant-veteran-bags-mr-gay-world-ph-title/,"08:17 PM March 31, 2019","QUEZON CITY — Perseverance proved to be rewarding for a pageant veteran who bagged the top plum of Mr. Gay World Philippines at the Mr. Fahrenheit search. Janjep Carlos bested 17 other aspirants for the title in the contest staged at the Fahrenheit Cafe and Fitness Center in Quezon City past midnight on Sunday. He earned the distinction of representing the Philippines in the Mr. Gay World contest in South Africa in May. The 41-year-old entrepreneur joined the 2016 Mr. Gay World Philippines search and finished in the Top 15. The national title went to John Raspado, who eventually became the first Asian to bag the Mr. Gay World crown in Spain. “He’s a friend of mine, and I personally saw how hard he worked to become a winner,” Carlos told the INQUIRER after his proclamation. “I will also work hard and do my best to make the country proud,” he continued. Carlos, who trades beauty products and glutathione supplements for a living, chose to speak about the mental health issues hounding members of the LGBTQI community, because of the discrimination and bullying they had been suffering. He earned P50,000 for winning the main title. The contest declared two runners-up of equal ranking — Macky Belen, 28, a professional make up artist from Laguna, and Kevin Garcia, 28, a business process outsourcing staff from Cebu City. This is the 17th edition of the Mr. Fahrenheit search, a pageant for gay men in the Philippines. Before, a separate contest for Mr. Gay World Philippines was held annually until 2016. The national franchise for the global title went to an overseas-based Filipino for the 2018 competition. It has now returned to entrepreneur Wilbert Tolentino, whose tenure produced Raspado and his predecessor Christian Lacsamana who finished third in the international contest. /atm  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
‘Being alone doesn’t mean nobody likes you’: Study says ‘alone time’ could be good for teens,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/329332/being-alone-doesnt-mean-nobody-likes-you-study-says-alone-time-could-be-good-for-teens/,"04:56 PM March 26, 2019","New United States research has suggested that spending some time alone could be a good thing for teenagers — and is not necessarily something to be worried about. Carried out by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz and Wilmington College, the new study recruited 803 adults and 176 adolescents and asked them to complete a new 14-item survey developed by the researchers for the study. The survey asked participants to rate their motivations for solitude on a four-point scale by answering questions such as, “I feel energized when I spend time by myself,” and “I enjoy the quiet,” as well as “I feel uncomfortable when I’m with others,” and “I regret things I say or do when I’m with others.” The findings, published in the Journal of Adolescence, showed that the key factor as to whether solitude has a positive or negative effect on mental health is choice. When adults or teens had solitude imposed on them, perhaps because they experienced anxiety, or when used as a punishment for teens, then this was linked with lower well-being and feelings of loneliness, social anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, if the participants chose solitude, then this appeared to have a positive effect on well-being and was associated with improved personal growth and self-acceptance. “Solitude has gotten a lot of bad press, especially for adolescents who get labeled as social misfits or lonely,” said co-author Margarita Azmitia. “Sometimes, solitude is good. Developmentally, learning to be alone is a skill, and it can be refreshing and restorative.” Co-author Virginia Thomas, Ph.D., also added that alone time can give teens an opportunity for self-reflection or creative expression, and that in today’s fast-paced world where we are always connected, some time for solitude can be a good thing. “Our culture is pretty biased toward extroversion,” she said. “When we see any sign of shyness or introversion in children, we worry they won’t be popular. But we overlook plenty of well-adjusted teens and young adults who are perfectly happy when alone, and who benefit from their solitude.” “The question is how to be alone without feeling like we’re missing out,” said Thomas. “For many people, solitude is like exercising a muscle they’ve never used. You have to develop it, flex it, and learn to use time alone to your benefit.” The researchers added that parents can play a role in helping children learn how to be alone, and that it can be a good thing. “Solitude can improve the well-being of kids who are overstimulated. They can learn to regulate their behavior, on their own, without being told to,” said Azmitia. “Parents can help their children understand that being alone isn’t bad.

Charlotte Howard of Hastings was at the bus stop when she saw a homeless man’s tent nearby, as well as a handwritten note. She took a picture of the man’s tent and the note before sharing it on Facebook last March 12 in an attempt to help him find a job. “Just saw this while waiting at the bus stop in Old Town opposite The Pelican,” she said. “Breaks my heart seeing things like this. Please share and try to help him get a job.”  Just saw this while waiting at the bus stop in old town opposite the pelican, breaks my heart seeing things like this. Please share and try to help him get a job. ❤️❤️ 由 Charlotte Howard 发布于 2019年3月12日周二 The homeless man’s note read: “Work wanted. I will do a trial for free to show how I work. I don’t take drugs or drink.” The homeless man listed the things he can do, such as dog walking-minding, window cleaning, shopping, gardening, car washing, housework and cooking, among others. “Anything to earn a living and make life seem worth living,” he wrote. “Help change a life.” Howard, who was moved by the note, went on to create a GoFundMe page for the homeless man. Her £300 ($395 or P20,700) goal was so she could buy a caravan for him as well as other basic necessities. Donations, however, continued to pile up and she received more than she expected. As of this writing, Howard has raised over £2,300 (approximately $3000 or P160,000). The homeless man has since been identified as 37-year-old Anthony Johnson, as per the Hastings & St. Leonards Observer on March 20. He has also been contacted by a landscape gardener named Nelson Smith for a potential job following Howard’s post. “The reaction after Charlotte posted the note was weird. I was suddenly bombarded with certain things,” Johnson was quoted as saying, as he confessed he used to be a “horrible person living a horrible life.” He spent time in and out of prison and was rendered homeless after finishing a four-year jail term. Today, he credits Howard for helping him have another go at life. “It’s not like I haven’t previously been asking for help but all it takes is an open-minded person like Charlotte to come along and help, ” he said. “She saw me and recognized my position and decided she wanted to do something to help. I wouldn’t have got anywhere looking for a job if it wasn’t for her.” Meanwhile, Smith was compelled to reach out to Howard after seeing her post, since he saw in Johnson a man just trying to help himself and turn his life around. “I have had problems with mental health in recent years and in this post I saw someone trying to help themselves,” Smith said in the report. “I contacted Charlotte and said I might be able to find something for him.” Cody Cepeda/JB RELATED STORIES: 17-year-old student prevails over homelessness, gets accepted into 17 colleges 19-year-old cashier pays for struggling customer’s grocery bill  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
International Day of Happiness 2019: How exercise can help boost joy,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/328580/international-day-of-happiness-2019-how-exercise-can-help-boost-joy/,"07:44 PM March 20, 2019","Wednesday, March 20 marks this year’s International Day of Happiness, first launched in 2013 by the United Nations to recognize and promote key aspects of happiness and well-being for everyone around the world. With many studies linking exercise to a reduced risk of mental health problems such as depression and a better mood, here we round up some of the recent research which shows that being active could make you happier. Work out in a group A small United States study found that working out in a group could bring bigger reductions in stress levels and bigger improvements in quality of life than working out alone, even though those who exercised alone worked out for twice as long. A European study which looked at elite and junior elite athletes also found that those who took part in individual sports were more likely to develop symptoms of depression than those who take part in team sports. The researchers explained that as social contact also appears to be a key factor in preventing depression, taking part in team rather than individual sports could also be beneficial. Get your kids exercising too A Canadian study published back in 2017 found that children who exercise may have a reduced risk of developing depression in the future. After conducting a meta-analysis of 40 studies involving a total of 90,000 kids and teens between the ages of eight and 19, the researchers found a statistically significant association between increased physical activity and a lower risk of future depressive symptoms. A Norwegian study published the same year also found that keeping active with moderate to vigorous physical activity, such as sports, games and exercise, could protect children aged six to eight from developing depression during childhood. Sign up for a Zumba class A small pilot study which looked at 60 inactive participants with a sedentary lifestyle found that taking part in Zumba classes could have long-lasting positive effects on health, especially on emotional well-being. After attending a Zumba physical exercise program three days a week over a five-week period, the participants showed significant improvements in their quality of life, as measured by eight different and important dimensions, with the emotional dimension showing the biggest improvement. Aim for just one hour a week Australian researchers found that even just one hour a week of physical activity could be enough to ward off depression. After following 33,908 Norwegian adults for more than 11 years, the team found that those who reported doing no exercise at all at the start of the study showed a 44 percent higher chance of developing depression compared to those who were exercising one to two hours a week, and that 12 percent of cases of depression could have been prevented if participants undertook just one hour of physical activity each week. Try cycling to work A European study which looked at the effect of various modes of transport on health found that active transport is better for boosting physical and mental health than more sedentary forms such as driving. The researchers found that cycling is the best urban mode of transport for boosting health, including better mental health, greater vitality, lower self-perceived stress and fewer feelings of loneliness, while walking was the second most beneficial transport mode.

"Women working long hours, weekends may have higher risk of depression",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/325721/p2fb-women-working-long-hours-weekends-may-have-higher-risk-of-depression/,"08:03 PM February 26, 2019","A new United Kingdom research has found that women who work long hours may have a higher risk of depression, and working weekends may up the risk for both men and women. Carried out by researchers at University College London, the Department of Research and Policy at Age UK, and Queen Mary University of London, the new study looked at data on 11,215 men and 12,188 women, which included occupational information and depressive symptoms as measured by a validated general health questionnaire. The researchers also took into account several potentially influential factors including age, marital status, whether participants had children, their wage and how satisfied they were with it, long-term health conditions and qualifications. A standard working week of 35 to 40 hours was used as a reference for categorizing working hours into less than 35 hours a week, 41 to 55 hours a week, defined as long working hours, and 55 hours a week or more, defined as extra-long working hours. The findings, published online in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, showed that women who worked extra-long hours of 55 or more hours a week and/or who worked most or every weekend had the worst mental health of all the participants, with significantly more depressive symptoms than women who worked standard hours. For men, working less or more hours than the standard working week had no effect on the number of depressive symptoms. However, working weekends was associated with an increased risk of depression in both sexes; men were more likely to experience more depressive symptoms when work conditions were taken into account, while for women, an increase in depressive symptoms was linked with the number of weekends worked. Generally, older workers, smokers and those who earned the least and who had the least job control were also more depressed, regardless of sex. As an observational study the researchers say that they cannot establish cause and effect. However, they also pointed out that “previous studies have found that once unpaid housework and caring is accounted for, women work longer than men, on average, and that this has been linked to poorer physical health.” “Our findings of more depressive symptoms among women working extra-long hours might also be explained by the potential double burden experienced by women when their long hours in paid work are added on their time in domestic labour.” They also noted that women are more likely to work longer hours in male-dominated occupations, and those working weekends are more likely to work in low-paid service sector jobs, adding that “such jobs, when combined with frequent or complex interactions with the public or clients, have been linked to higher levels of depression.” JB RELATED STORIES: Poor diet low in fruit and veggies, high in junk food linked with increased risk of mental illness  Foreseeing the future: What you need to know before retiring   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
WATCH: Mom hand-feeds son who’s too busy with non-stop gaming,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/325404/p2fb-watch-mom-hand-feeds-son-whos-too-busy-with-non-stop-gaming/,"07:11 PM February 24, 2019","What would you do if you have a child addicted to video games? One mother in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, instead of being irritated by her son’s addiction, has seemingly accepted it, and opts to continue taking care of him, though in a rather strange way. The mother, Lilybeth Marvel Garcia, recently shared a Facebook video of herself going to the local computer shop, with a plate of food for her son, 14-year-old Carlito. Since the teen was busy playing his favorite computer game, “Rules of Survival”, Garcia made sure he will not skip his meal — by hand-feeding him. “Napakarami mo namang barya, baka bukas ka pa umuwi niyan!” Garcia asked her son. “Umiihi ka pa ba? Diyos ko, nakakaawa naman itong anak ko.” (You have so many coins, you might not go home until tomorrow. Do you even take a toilet break? Good Lord, my son is pathetic.) Garcia’s video became viral, with about 44,000 likes-reactions and 2.5 million views before it was removed from her timeline. Her video was later re-uploaded by Viral Press in YouTube.  The 37-year-old massage therapist mom told INQUIRER.net today, Feb. 24, that she and her husband decided to have Carlito, a grade 8 student, drop out of school this year due to his condition. “Lahat [ng] subject [niya nung] first grading (ng school) bagsak,” the mother confessed. “Kinausap ko sya sabi niya pagbubutihan niya next (grading), then nung [second] grading na siya, wala na siyang ipinasok (na klase).” (He failed all of his subjects on the first grading period of school. I talked to him and he promised that he will do better next grading. By the time of the second grading period, he was not attending his classes anymore.) At first, Garcia tried to discipline her son by nagging at him and spanking him. Since that did not work, she made him do household chores for a minimal fee. “Twenty pesos araw-araw yung binibigay ko sa kanya,” she said. “[K]apalit no’n yung araw-araw na gawain sa bahay para madala siya at pilitin pumasok next school year.” (I give him 20 pesos everyday to do household chores, to teach him a lesson and to encourage him to go back to school next year.) But for Garcia, Carlito is not really a game addict because he helps around with the household chores and knows his limitations. “‘Pag wala naman ring siyang pera, nanonood lang siya,” she added. (When he does not have money for playing, he just watches [other gamers].) She also denied that her son can last up to 48 hours playing, and clarified an earlier statement from the deleted post, “Katuwaan lang po ‘yun.” (It was only a joke.) The mom explained that she removed the video from her timeline because of the hateful comments she received. She also clarified that when the video was taken, it was the only time she brought food for her son — as a way to make him feel guilty for what she has to do for him. “Huwag po sana sila mag-base sa napapanood lang nila o sa maling balita. Kasi hindi nila alam kung ano ang nasa likod ng video na ‘yun. Yung video na ‘yun ay simpleng katuwaan lang,” she appealed to netizens. (People should not rely on everything they see or hear, or on false news, because they do not know what is behind the story of the video. The video I made was simply just for fun.)

Face tattoos: a trend that is here to stay?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/324375/face-tattoos-a-trend-that-is-here-to-stay/,"12:51 PM February 14, 2019","NEW YORK — Face tattoos, once limited to only a very small group of people, have gained new popularity thanks to today’s rappers — but some artists are reluctant to make such a permanent change to a client’s appearance. In New York’s East Village, some of the would-be customers entering tattoo parlors are still teenagers — some of them have never even had any body art, but nevertheless want to indelibly inscribe something on their face. “Of late, it has become a very big trend because of what they see on TV,” said Armando Guevara, who mans the reception desk at Andromeda Studio 33, which also does piercings. What young people are seeing on television are people like Grammy-nominated rapper Post Malone, the current poster boy of so-called mumble rap, also called SoundCloud rap or emo rap. The popular sub-genre is characterized by its trap beats and lyrics that often touch on mental health problems and their consequences — drugs, meds and lots of sex. Words are slurred and sometimes sung. From Malone to the controversial 21 Savage, Lil Uzi Vert and the late XXXTentacion, nearly all mumble rappers have face tattoos — breaking with their elders who had little interest in the look. And when the Mondial du Tatouage, the World Tattoo Expo, opens in Paris on Friday, the trend will certainly be on full display. Shaggy Johnsen, a 22-year-old New Yorker who had Bugs Bunny inked on his temple, admits he was influenced by his favorite rappers. “I’m an artist myself,” Johnsen said, explaining he’s a “freestyle” rapper. “It’s all about how you promote yourself — how you bring yourself out.” Since getting face ink, Johnsen says he’s only gotten positive reactions. “Everybody likes it,” he said, adding that he loves cartoon characters, and he might next go for Tweety or the Tasmanian Devil. Adam Alonso says face art is a “mask” that he can hide behind. “I’ve been hurt in the past so I don’t want to be hurt no more so I keep a wall up so people on the streets won’t even talk to me,” the model and rapper told AFP. The word AGONY is written under his right eye in large ornate letters. Alonso insists the tattoos have not hurt him professionally. “People think that when you tattoo your face, you’re not going to make money. But nothing’s impossible. I still make money,” he said. “It is to prove I can do the impossible and if I can do it, anyone can do it.” Looking for those who are ‘not ready’ Guevara is not against face tattoos — he has several of them, including a huge one inspired by pre-Columbian art that covers about a quarter of his face. But he advises clients to be extra cautious before taking the leap. “If you’re going to do something on your face that is permanent, think about it. Try it out,” says the 40-something Guevara, who is of Nicaraguan descent. Every morning for months, he drew his planned tattoo onto his face, to get used to it and gauge reactions, before he went under the ink needle. Many younger customers do not realize the implications of what they are asking for, according to Guevara. “They don’t really know that it’s a lifetime thing, that it will deeply impact their life. We turn them away,” he says, explaining that minors are not welcomed at Andromeda. “You’re going to have a lot of people that are going to discriminate against you, a lot of places that won’t give you housing, that won’t give you employment,” Guevara said, adding he had been the victim of discrimination over his body art. “When people see a tattoo on their face, they feel that the person is careless, angry, antisocial or very anarchist,” he said. “I’m a good person, hard worker, very intelligent — but that’s not what people see.” Guevara dispelled the notion that face tattoos can be easily removed with lasers, saying such a procedure takes numerous procedures, isn’t cheap and can leave scarring. At Andromeda, those who want face tattoos are required to answer questions about why they want to do it, and how they see it affecting their life. “If we feel that they’re not ready for it, we turn them away,” Guevara says. Some studios refuse to do them on principle, like Fineline Tattoo, which claims to be the oldest parlor in New York — it opened in 1976, even though tattoos were officially banned in the city from 1961 to 1997. Mehai Bakaty, the owner of the shop and an artist, says face tattoos were long reserved for gang members and prison inmates who had “given up” on mainstream society. “You almost wonder, especially in America, if young people are attracted to that sort of things for similar kinds of reasons,” Bakaty said. “They don’t have hope of becoming anything more than a checkout clerk,” he lamented. “I think that’s kind of the point that these young rap people are trying to make, but I just see the whole scenario as completely irresponsible.”  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
"Eating vegetables, fish during pregnancy may help reduce risk of high blood pressure",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/323966/p2fb-eating-vegetables-and-fish-during-pregnancy-may-help-reduce-risk-of-high-blood-pressure/,"04:47 PM February 10, 2019","New European research has found that eating a diet rich in vegetables and fish during pregnancy could help lower the risk of developing high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia. Carried out by researchers at Imperial College London and the University of Bristol, the new large-scale study looked at 55,138 women who took part in the Danish National Birth Cohort. The women were asked to complete several telephone interviews, including two during pregnancy at 12 and 30 weeks and two interviews at six and 18 months after birth. They also completed a questionnaire on their dietary habits at week 25 of their pregnancy. The findings, published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics, showed that eating a diet rich in vegetables and fish appeared to reduce the risk of developing gestational hypertension by 14 percent and pre-eclampsia by 21 percent. On the other hand, following a Western diet, which is high in potatoes, meat, white bread and margarine, increased the risk of developing gestational hypertension by 18 percent and pre-eclampsia by 40 percent. On average, women with high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia also had a higher body mass index (1.6-2.3 kg/m2 higher) than those without the conditions. While the researchers point out that the study only shows an association between diet and the risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy, rather than a causal relationship, they add that the results do add to an existing body of evidence that supports following a healthy, well-balanced diet. Author of the study Ms. Emmanuella Ikem also added that, “Our findings support the importance of eating a healthy and well-balanced diet in vegetables and fish and cutting out processed foods where possible. This will help to reduce a woman’s risk of developing high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy.” “Current advice recommends eating at least five portions of different fruit and vegetables every day, instead of foods high in fat. And generally it is safe to consume fish during pregnancy, no more than two portions of oily fish, such as mackerel or salmon, a week, and no more than two fresh tuna steaks or four medium-sized cans of tuna a week. Women should avoid eating shark, swordfish or marlin.” According to previous research, high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, affects around 1 in 10 pregnancies. Pre-eclampsia, a condition related to high blood pressure which can cause serious complications for mother and baby, affects 2 to 8 in every 100 women and develops from around 20 weeks of gestation.

You are not alone, as your generation may be more familiar with the music of that era, a new study found. Researchers from New York University found that the people of today are more familiar with the music released from the 1960s to the 1990s than those of today. The research, released on Wednesday, is published in the journal PLOS One. For the study, researchers gathered 643 respondents, with the majority ranging from 18 to 25 years old living in the New York metropolitan area. They were asked to listen to a random selection of seven songs to gauge their familiarity with them. The songs used in the study were No. 1 hits from the Billboard Top 100 from 1940 to 1957, and from those topping the Billboard Hot 100 from 1958 to 2015. The study found that the respondents had more recognition of music released from the 1960s to the 1990s. Meanwhile, their memory of songs released from 2000 t0 2015 was found to have a steep-linear drop-off in recognition. As for songs released in the 1940s and 1950s, it was found that their recognition from this era was characterized by a more gradual drop-off. “The 1960s to 1990s was a special time in music, reflected by a steady recognition of pieces of that era—even by today’s millennials,” said Pascal Wallisch,clinical assistant professor in New York University’s Department of Psychology and the study’s senior author. However, researchers also acknowledged that the results may be rooted in self-selection, as they observed a “considerable correlation between the likelihood of recognizing a given song and its corresponding play count on Spotify.” “Spotify was launched in 2008, well after nearly 90 percent of the songs we studied were released, which indicates millennials are aware of the music that, in general, preceded their lives and are nonetheless choosing to listen to it,” Wallisch added.  /ra RELATED STORIES: Attending concerts helps you live longer, new study finds Listening to too much Christmas songs may damage mental health, says expert    CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex dropped by non-profit Empire Fighting Chance on Feb. 1 during their tour of the English city. The charity offers non-contact boxing lessons and a mentorship program to help youth from deprived communities in the United Kingdom. One of the kids Harry and Meghan encountered was 15-year-old Iestyn Jones who became emotional as he spoke about his father who had passed away. It struck a chord so much with Harry that he reportedly asked everyone to leave the room so he could speak one-on-one with the boy, according to a tweet from royal reporter Emily Andrews. Jones told reporters, as per People on Feb. 1, that the private chat lasted for 10 minutes. “He knew some stuff about me and the same thing happened to me,” the teen said. He was also touched by Harry’s gesture after their talk: “When we had a group picture at the end he made sure I was standing next to him. They were lovely people. I didn’t expect them to be like that. They were amazing people.” Harry, who advocates for mental health alongside Prince William and Duchess Catherine through the campaign Heads Together, has previously opened up on how boxing helped him deal with his mother’s death. Princess Diana passed away in 1997 when he was 12. READ: Prince Harry suffered ‘total chaos’ over Diana’s death He told Daily Telegraph in 2017 that he sought professional help when he was older — after 20 years of repressing his emotions about the loss of his mom. “During those years I took up boxing, because everyone was saying boxing is good for you and it’s a really good way of letting out aggression,” he said in the report. “And that really saved me because I was on the verge of punching someone; so being able to punch someone who had pads was certainly easier.” Niña V.

Mindfulness may be effective treatment for chronic pain sufferers,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/322943/mindfulness-may-be-effective-treatment-for-chronic-pain-sufferers/,"01:23 PM February 01, 2019","New Canadian research has found that mindfulness meditation may be effective in easing chronic pain as well as its associated symptoms. Led by researchers at Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, the new review looked at 21 clinical trials involving nearly 2,000 people to assess the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on chronic pain, which is defined as pain lasting at least three months. Participants were aged between 35 and 65, mainly women, with some living with chronic pain for over a decade. CBT is currently the most widely used psychological technique for the treatment of chronic pain, although not everyone living with chronic pain finds the technique helpful, note the researchers. Mindfulness meditation, which has grown in popularity in recent years for a number of conditions, is a type of meditation which helps promote stress relief by encouraging individuals to focus on being in the moment, paying attention to their thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations and the immediate environment. The findings, published online in the journal Evidence Based Mental Health, showed that there were no important differences between using either CBT or mindfulness, with the researchers finding that both significantly reduced the severity of pain, improved physical functioning, and also improved depression associated with chronic pain, when compared with usual or no care. The researchers did advise caution when interpreting the results, saying that only one of the 21 trials directly compared CBT with mindfulness, only 12 trials were deemed to be of reasonable or good quality, and that it is still too early to tell whether CBT or mindfulness is better for people with different types of pain and psychological symptoms. They suggest further research in this area, but conclude that, “While CBT is considered to be the preferred psychological intervention of [chronic pain], not all patients with [it] experience a clinically significant treatment response.” “Although a number of recommendations have been proposed to improve CBT for patients with chronic pain, an additional solution may be to offer patients mindfulness based stress reduction since it shows promise in improving pain severity and reducing pain interference and psychological distress.” CC RELATED STORIES: Coud mindfulness help menopause symptoms?

Man who worked as ‘gay conversion therapist’ comes out as gay,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/322516/man-who-worked-as-gay-conversion-therapist-comes-out-as-gay/,"05:53 PM January 28, 2019","An influential personality in “gay conversion therapy” in the United States has left the movement and said he wants to date men. David Matheson, a 52-year-old Mormon who promoted “ex-gay therapy,” which promotes the idea that being gay can be “cured,” made the announcement on Facebook last Jan. 22. The declaration came after LGBTQ advocacy group Truth Wins Out (TWO) reported on Jan. 20 a private conversation between Matheson and “conversion therapy” advocate Rich Wyler. Wyler said in a private Facebook group, “David… says that living a single, celibate life ‘just isn’t feasible for him, so he’s seeking a male partner. He has gone from bisexuality to exclusively gay.” Matheson and Wyler developed the program “Journey into Manhood,” a retreat where gay men are made to perform “manly” activities in the forest, supposedly to alter their sexual orientation. Matheson also co-authored a study in 2006 called “Holistic Therapy: A Comprehensive, Clinical Approach to the Treatment of SSA (same-sex attraction).” The controversial paper has been slammed by TWO as “anti-gay and extremely offensive, habitually confusing crass stereotypes with actual science.” Last November, it was revealed that his partner in the study, Norman Goldwasser, was soliciting sex in a gay dating app. The American Psychological Association (APA) has denounced such “treatments” because they “see homosexuality as a mental disorder, a concept that has been rejected by the mental health professions for more than 35 years.” ‘It was time’ In his personal Facebook post last Jan. 22, Matheson said that he had a “happy and fulfilling marriage” with his wife. “But I also experienced attractions to men. Much of the time these were in the background. But sometimes they were very intense and led to pain and struggle in my marriage,” he said. While he had no regrets about his marriage, Matheson said his marriage began to be strained a few years ago. “Toward the end of this decline, I also realized that being in an intimate relationship with a man was no longer something I wanted to avoid,” he said. “It had become a non-negotiable need.” “Even today, as a newly-out gay man, I still find too much homophobia in myself. But I’m a much more accepting person now than I was 6 years ago before I started dialoguing in a mixed-ideology group that included several gay-affirming therapists,” he said. He also apologized for his work in the “ex-gay” industry, but said he believed he helped others. “Not that I would excuse myself, but any shortcomings I had as a therapist came from too narrow a view of what ‘emotionally healthy’ can look like. They came from my own homophobia and narrow mindedness,” he stated. “I am truly sorry for those flaws and the harm they have surely caused some people. And I’m sorry for the confusion and pain my choice may be causing others.” JB RELATED STORIES: ‘Three Billboards’ campaign targets gay conversion therapy in China UK to ban gay ‘conversion therapy’ after massive survey Researcher apologizes for study of gay therapy  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019

In addition, at an average of two years before death, the participants were also asked to wear an accelerometer to measure their physical activity for a period of seven days. Using the data collected, the researchers were able to calculate an average daily activity score, which was measured in counts per day. The overall average was 160,000 counts per day, although people without dementia had an average of 180,000 counts per day, while people with dementia had an average of 130,000 counts per day. As all participants had also agreed to donate their brains for research upon their deaths, with the average age at death 91 years, the researchers were also able to examine the donated brain tissue to look for lesions and biomarkers of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. The findings, published in Neurology, showed that higher levels of daily movement were linked to better thinking and memory skills, with even a small increase in activity appearing to reduce the risk of dementia. Those who had better motor skills, which help with movement and coordination, also had better thinking and memory skills. Physical activity also appeared to improve test scores even after the researchers had taken into account the severity of participants’ brain lesions, with the team finding that the relationship was consistent in both people who had dementia and people who did not have dementia. “We measured levels of physical activity in study participants an average of two years prior to their deaths, and then examined their donated brain tissue after death, and found that a more active lifestyle may have a protective effect on the brain,” said Dr. Aron S. Buchman, lead author of the study paper. “People who moved more had better thinking and memory skills compared to those who were more sedentary and did not move much at all.” The team noted that although exercise may help protect the brain as we age, further research is needed to investigate this relationship. “Exercise is an inexpensive way to improve health, and our study shows it may have a protective effect on the brain,” said Buchman. “But it is important to note that our study does not show cause and effect.” “It may also be possible that as people lose memory and thinking skills, they reduce their physical activity,” he added. “More studies are needed to determine if moving more is truly beneficial to the brain.” JB RELATED STORIES: Sedentary lifestyle cancels out heart benefits of healthy weight  5 ways to boost your mental health this year   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
"Children who have connection with nature are less emotional, more social, better behaved — study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/321193/p2fb-children-who-have-connection-with-nature-are-less-emotional-more-social-better-behaved-study/,"06:54 PM January 15, 2019","New research from Hong Kong has shown that children who spend time in nature may benefit from fewer behavioral and emotional problems and improved pro-social behavior. Carried out by researchers at the University of Hong Kong and the University of Auckland, New Zealand, the study used a new 16-item parent questionnaire (CNI-PPC) developed by the study authors Dr. Tanja Sobko and Prof. Gavin Brown to measure young children’s “connectedness to nature.” Until now, researchers have not been able to measure connectedness to nature in preschool children, mainly due to the fact that they are too young to answer for themselves. However, the researchers wanted to investigate how feeling connected to the natural environment could impact health at this age. “We noticed a tendency where parents are avoiding nature. They perceive it as dirty and dangerous, and their children unfortunately pick up these attitudes. In addition, the green areas are often unwelcoming with signs like ‘Keep off the grass,'” explained Dr. Sobko. The researchers recruited 493 families with children aged between two and five, and asked them to complete the questionnaire, which measures four areas that show a child’s relationship with nature, including enjoyment of nature, empathy for nature, responsibility towards nature and awareness of nature. The findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE, showed that children who had a closer connection with nature, as reported by their parents, showed less distress, less hyperactivity, fewer behavioral and emotional difficulties and improved pro-social behavior. In addition, children who took greater responsibility towards nature were also found to have fewer difficulties with their peers. The researchers say the results now suggest that the questionnaire could be a valuable tool for investigating the link between the outdoor environment and well-being in pre-school children, with city life often blamed as a major reason why children are disconnected from nature and spend less time playing and more time being sedentary. They added that despite 90 percent of the Hong Kong population living within 400 meters of “green areas,” families rarely use them, and also note that 16 percent of pre-schoolers in Hong Kong and up to 22 percent in China show signs of mental health problems.

He made me feel special but flirted with everyone,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320893/he-made-me-feel-special-but-flirted-with-everyone/,"04:59 PM January 13, 2019","I am a 23-year-old girl who has finished medical school, and currently doing my internship. I started internship 10 months back with no expectations about work or people. It was my first posting. We were a unit consisting of professors, associates, assistant professors, postgraduates and interns. My postgraduates were two men. One of them seemed very quiet and completely ignored my existence and never asked me to do any work. That’s probably because he thought I was disinterested and maybe because I was extremely fat and unattractive (I still am). So he ignored me week after week and didn’t allow me to do any work. This irritated me because I wanted to learn and he wasn’t giving me an opportunity to learn. My co-interns (who are girls) would get all the work. However, I was attracted to him because he was cute. But I felt he was a misfit in the medical profession because he was very cold and rude. However, as time passed, I saw his good side. I saw how he did his job very well and how he was extremely caring towards the patients. I was even more attracted to him and felt bad for judging him. However, I never did anything about my feelings. I started working hard because I didn’t want to give him an opportunity to yell at me or demean me for making mistakes. He noticed that I was getting better at my work and started speaking to me. One day, he was sitting alone at the hospital canteen eating breakfast. I had finished eating but went to sit with him until he finished. From that day, things changed. He started teasing me and giving me his attention. That kind of behavior progressed to teasing me at every given opportunity he would get. He would call my name a hundred times a day. He would touch me while assisting in surgeries. He was kind. He would speak to me in our local language and not English. I was already attracted to him and respected and admired him for his hard work and caring nature towards patients. So when he started giving me all his attention, I enjoyed it and liked him even more. I thought of him as an introverted person who had a hard time talking to people and he was opening up to me. I was falling in love with him. My co-interns wondered why he kept teasing me and gave me all the work and they came to the conclusion that he liked me. I thought he liked me too but was having a hard time expressing it so I would always stay quiet when he teased me. Then, my posting at that department came to an end. I was leaving for another department and he took us interns out for an end-of-posting treat. He was very quiet and didn’t speak much during that dinner. I spoke a lot because I wanted him to know that I liked him. Not sure if he realized that. After I left, I learnt that this guy was the biggest flirt on the face of this Earth and he was doing the same thing with his new intern. I learnt that he flirted with all the nurses, students and interns. This shattered me and I stopped speaking to him whenever I bumped into him in the hospital. He tried talking to me but I told him that I didn’t want to speak to him because he used his interns to get work done and was nice to them only because they had to work for him. I also said another reason was that I was a form of entertainment to him. He said that he has never been so close to anyone and has never teased anyone other than me. He also said that if that was what I thought of him, then he should stop talking to me and said good bye. Since then, we haven’t spoken to each other and he kept flirting with all his interns. He recently told his intern about how he lost his virginity to his ex and how she reminds him of her. He said the same thing to his next intern but this time told her that he really liked her. For the past 10 months, I have been crying almost every day, not being able to forget him nor fill the void that’s been created with his absence in my life. I miss him. I like him despite knowing how he is. I have neglected every aspect of my life like my health, my studies and family because I want him more than anything. I am not able to understand why he did what he did to me. Why did he not like me further? Was it because I was fat and ugly? Why? I am not happy. I am lost and uncertain of what I would do if I were never able to see him again. What should I do? Why did he flirt with me and not my co-interns who are beautiful? Did he ever like me even for a moment? Does he know that I like him? I want answers for all this. I miss him. I really need your help Thelma. Yours faithfully The heartbroken girl — Your doctor has discovered that being surrounded by adoring staff is very useful to him. With just a bit of flirting and attention, he has you all running around, desperate to please him. And woe betide those who don’t fall under his spell! To them, he’s cold and rude. I’m sure he’s thoroughly enjoying his position as king of the castle but it’s neither kind nor ethical. He is abusing his authority and hurting the people who work in his team. Also, I don’t like that sex discussion. It is totally inappropriate in the workplace. I can’t tell from your letter whether he understands the consequences of his behavior but the fact that he’s doing it is a problem. He’s either cold and manipulative or not bright enough to see how wrong his behavior is. Neither reflects well on him, does it? I’m very sorry you are hurt but my dear, this man isn’t worth your tears. Don’t waste your time on him; invest it in you. From your letter, you have a very poor opinion of yourself. You disparage your appearance and suggest that you aren’t measuring up to your colleagues. Where on earth is this coming from? You are succeeding in your studies and in your training. Not only are you perfectly capable but from your letter, you are intelligent, kind, thoughtful, modest and forgiving. What’s not to love? Go and see a therapist as soon as you can and start building up your self-esteem. Also, you say you were irritated because being shy meant you were almost denied an opportunity to learn. It may be your lack of self-esteem that is to blame but you could probably do with a little self-assertiveness coaching as well. Finally, those feelings of sadness and hopelessness are typical of depression. When you consult your mental health professional, have yourself assessed. And remember, you can influence and change your feelings, so know there’s hope for good change, okay? With a little bit of help, you’re going to be much more confident and that will help you reach out for the love you deserve. Pick a decent man who doesn’t play mind games and be happy.

A peculiar wish: more sex,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320172/a-peculiar-wish-more-sex/,"05:54 PM January 06, 2019","Judging from the turbulence in the market in the last quarter of 2018, I am expecting 2019 to be challenging and unpredictable. For me, in my New Year resolution, I am setting my mind on something a bit more predictable and within my control. I am not focusing on keeping healthy or making more money. I have a peculiar wish – more sex in 2019! I think my wife and I have grown apart as we are neglecting the bedroom matters. My job is taking up a lot of my time and the kids are consuming most of my wife’s energy. As a result, we barely have sex once a month. Even that, it often takes a bit of effort. I told my wife about my New Year’s resolution. She was quite shocked. My wife thinks too much sex at our age is harmful, and I should accept that active sex life is just a thing of the past! I would like to put Dr. G on the spot in this New Year, about the risks and benefits of having more sex in the 40s. Is having too much sex bad for the heart and the kidney? I also read somewhere that too much ejaculation reduces the risk of cancer. Surely that is just a joke? As we are only in the first week of the New Year, I am hoping to get some encouragement and tips on how to embark on a red hot sizzling New Year in the bedroom (and hopefully, occasionally outside the bedroom too!) On that note, wishing Dr G a Happy New Year! Regards,
Money Man It doesn’t take a genius to tell you that more sex is fun! Contrary to eastern myths, individuals with more sex have proven to live longer, have a healthier heart and lower rates of certain cancers. In a British study, men who had sex twice a week were noted to live longer than men who had sex less than once a month. The same study also revealed people who had intercourse twice a week were less likely to have fatal coronary events. Another study from Biological Psychology demonstrated that more sexually active subjects have less hypertension and less fluctuating blood pressure. A French study revealed that women who have frequent vaginal intercourse have three time less chances of breast cancer. On the other hand, a Minnesota study found men who had intercourse 3,000 times in their lives have half the risk of prostate cancer compared with those who had not. Benjamin Franklin once said: “How few there are who have courage enough to own their faults, or resolution enough to mend them!” In busy urbanite lifestyle, there are always other priorities in life that takes precedence over bedroom matters. Having no time, no energy and too much sex being risky at certain age are certainly excuses many would put forward when the passion diminishes. When Dr G is put on the spot by men who want to reignite the passion between the sheets, especially in the new dawn of the 2019, his advice is: “Those who have courage to accept their diminishing sex lives should focus on the benefits of sex on their physical and mental health.” On that note, set realistic goals for 2019! Dr. George Lee is a consultant Urologist and Clinical Associate Professor whose professional interest is in men’s health. The column “Putting Dr G on the spot” is a forum to help men debunk the myths and taboos on men’s issues that may be too “hard” to mention.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
Kate Middleton wants to send Prince George to school that saved her from bullying—report,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/319916/kate-middleton-wants-to-send-prince-george-to-school-that-saved-her-from-bullying-report/,"04:50 PM January 03, 2019","Kate Middleton is said to prefer sending her firstborn, Prince George, to her co-ed boarding school rather than Prince William’s all-boys boarding school Eton College. Kate flourished in Marlborough College, located at the south of England, when she moved there in 1996 after being bullied in her previous school, the Daily Mail reported on Dec. 27. According to interviews with Kate’s classmates and school administrators, the Duchess of Cambridge had to leave her all-girls private school Downe House in the middle of the school year because she was being teased, reported The Sun back in 2011. According to her friend Jessica Hay, Kate was 13 at the time and an “emotional wreck.” She was allegedly being teased for being “perfect, well turned-out and lovely.” When she entered Marlborough, she was quiet and lacked confidence, classmates told the Daily Mail. Her house tutor, Joan Gall, noted that she even had eczema due to the stress. But it did not take long for Kate to settle in, supposedly because of the nurturing environment of the school. According to Gall, there was a family atmosphere where baking and watching videos—TV show “Friends” was a favorite—were pastimes. The Duchess, who has an athletic streak, took to hockey and remains friends with her teammates. She was also involved in tennis, swimming, high jump and netball. In her later teen years, Kate was a campus heartthrob and reportedly had her first kiss with a brother of a close friend. She was well-behaved too—never engaging in underage drinking with the other kids—and took on leadership roles such as prefect and head of the house. Incidentally, Prince William would go to the campus for school events, but he and his future wife did not have encounters then. Kate had a fondness for him back then: Hay recalled her saying, “I bet he’s really kind. You can tell by just looking at him.” Should George, now 5, attend Marlborough in the future, tuition is likely to remain as one of the highest among independent private schools. Attending one term currently costs £12,605 (P830,000). Marlborough’s facilities include an observatory, a swimming pool with a hydraulic bottom to adjust its depth, a rifle range and outdoor fields for sports ranging from rugby to lacrosse. Princes William and Harry were both in boarding school by age 8, though it is yet to be announced if George will follow suit. Perhaps as a nod to the future queen’s harsher teen years, Kate and William asked guests at their 2011 wedding to donate to charity Beatbullying. They have also advocated mental health with the campaign Heads Together.  Niña V.

"Want to sleep better, feel better and save money? Take part in ‘Dry January’ says new study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/319698/p2fb-want-to-sleep-better-feel-better-and-save-money-take-part-in-dry-january-says-new-study/,"04:19 PM January 01, 2019"," New United Kingdom research has found that taking part in Dry January, which involves staying away from alcohol for a month, could help people lose weight, sleep better, boost energy, save money and reduce drinking long-term. Carried out by the University of Sussex, the new study surveyed U.K. adults who took part in Dry January in 2018, an event which is organized in the U.K. by the charity Alcohol Change UK. The first survey questioned 2,821 people who had registered for Dry January; the second questioned 1,715 in the first week of February; and the final survey included 816 participants in August. The findings showed that those who take part in Dry January also report drinking less months later, with alcohol consumption also lower in August. Participants also reported drinking on fewer days, with the average number of drinking days falling on average from 4.3 to 3.3 per week. The units consumed per drinking day also dropped on average from 8.6 to 7.1, and the frequency of being drunk dropped from 3 to 4 times per month to 2.1 times per month on average. Other benefits of Dry January included a sense of achievement, reported by 93 percent of participants, and saving money, reported by 88 percent of those surveyed. Taking in part in Dry January also led to 82 percent of participants thinking more about their relationship with drink, with 80 percent feeling more in control of their drinking and 76 percent learning more about when and why they drink. A large number (71 percent) also realized that they don’t need a drink to enjoy themselves. Cutting back on booze also brought a large number of other health benefits including improved overall health, better sleep, more energy, weight loss, better concentration and better skin. “The simple act of taking a month off alcohol helps people drink less in the long term: by August people are reporting one extra dry day per week. There are also considerable immediate benefits: nine in ten people save money, seven in ten sleep better and three in five lose weight,” said lead author Dr. Richard de Visser. “Interestingly, these changes in alcohol consumption have also been seen in the participants who didn’t manage to stay alcohol-free for the whole month, although they are a bit smaller. This shows that there are real benefits to just trying to complete Dry January,” he added. Dr. Richard Piper, CEO of Alcohol Change UK, also commented on the findings saying, “Put simply, Dry January can change lives. We hear every day from people who took charge of their drinking using Dry January, and who feel healthier and happier as a result.” “Many of us know about the health risks of alcohol (seven forms of cancer, liver disease, mental health problems) but we are often unaware that drinking less has more immediate benefits too. Sleeping better, feeling more energetic, saving money, better skin, losing weight,” he said. “The list goes on. Dry January helps millions to experience those benefits and to make a longer-lasting change to drink more healthily.” According to the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis, and to spread drinking over three or more days if regularly drinking this amount. A small glass of wine (125 milliliters, alcohol by volume 12 percent) counts as 1.5 units, and a standard glass (175 milliliters, alcohol by volume 12 percent) 2.1 units. A 750 milliliter bottle of wine (alcohol by volume 13.5 percent) contains 10 units. A pint of lager/beer/cider (alcohol by volume 5.2 percent) counts as 3 units and a 330 milliliter bottle of lager/beer/cider (alcohol volume by 5 percent) is 1.7 units.

Depression and anxiety could be as harmful as smoking and obesity,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/319194/depression-and-anxiety-could-be-as-harmful-as-smoking-and-obesity/,"05:58 PM December 27, 2018","New United States research has found that depression and anxiety could be as bad for health as smoking and obesity, increasing the risk of conditions such as heart disease and arthritis. Carried out by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, the new large-scale study looked at health data taken from a government study of 15,418 retirees with an average age of 68. The participants’ depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using interviews, and data was also recorded on participants’ current smoking status, weight, medical diagnoses and somatic symptoms on two occasions over four years. The findings, published in the journal Health Psychology, showed that anxiety and depression symptoms predicted a higher rate of nearly all medical illnesses and somatic symptoms. Participants with high levels of anxiety and depression had a 65 percent increased chance of a heart condition, a 64 percent higher risk of stroke, a 50 percent higher risk of high blood pressure and an 87 percent higher risk of arthritis, compared to those without anxiety and depression. An increase in somatic symptoms such as headache, stomach upset, back pain and shortness of breath also appeared to be linked with high stress and depression. The effect was also as strong as or stronger than those of obesity and smoking, with the risk of experiencing headaches 161 percent higher in this group, compared with no increased risk among the participants who were obese and smokers. “These increased odds are similar to those of participants who are smokers or are obese,” said senior author Aoife O’Donovan, Ph.D, “However, for arthritis, high anxiety and depression seem to confer higher risks than smoking and obesity.” However, the researchers found that high levels of depression and anxiety were not associated with risk of cancer, a finding in line with previous studies, despite many patients believing that there is a link, say the researchers. “Our findings are in line with a lot of other studies showing that psychological distress is not a strong predictor of many types of cancer,” O’Donovan said. “On top of highlighting that mental health matters for a whole host of medical illnesses, it is important that we promote these null findings. We need to stop attributing cancer diagnoses to histories of stress, depression and anxiety.” “To our knowledge this is the first study that directly compared anxiety and depression to obesity and smoking as prospective risk factors for disease onset in long-term studies,” said first author Andrea Niles, Ph.D., who believes the findings highlight the need for health care practitioners to pay more attention to these mental health conditions. “Anxiety and depression symptoms are strongly linked to poor physical health, yet these conditions continue to receive limited attention in primary care settings, compared to smoking and obesity,” she added.

Regular trips to cultural events could reduce risk of depression later in life,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/317663/p2fb-regular-trips-to-cultural-events-could-reduce-risk-of-depression-later-in-life/,"02:56 PM December 16, 2018","New United Kingdom research has found that seniors could lower their chances of depression in old age by making regular trips to the cinema, theater or museums. The study by researchers at University College London looked at data on 2,148 people over the age of 50, none of whom had depression at the start of the study. The participants completed questionnaires and one-to-one interviews over a period of ten years, reporting on how often they visited the theater, the opera, the cinema, concerts, art galleries, exhibitions or museums. They were also asked to report on whether they had been diagnosed with depression during this time, and when they experienced symptoms of depression, so that researchers could evaluate those at risk of the condition. The findings, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, showed a clear link between how often participants went out to these cultural events and their chance of developing depression. Those who attended films, plays or exhibitions every few months had a 32 per cent lower risk of developing depression, with those attending once a month or more having a 48 per cent lower risk. The results held true even after accounting for other potential factors such as age, gender, health, and levels of wealth, education and exercise. The positive effect of engaging in cultural activities was independent of whether participants had contact with friends and family or took part in social activities like clubs and societies. This is the first study of its kind to show that cultural activities can not only help people manage and recover from depression but also help prevent it. “We were very pleasantly surprised by the results,” commented lead author Dr. Daisy Fancourt. “Notably we find the same relationship between cultural engagement and depression amongst those of high and low wealth and of different levels of education; the only thing that differs is the frequency of participation.” “Cultural engagement is what we call a ‘perishable commodity.’ For it to have long-term benefits for mental health, we need to engage in activities regularly. This is similar to exercise: going for a run on the first of January won’t still have benefits in October unless we keep going for runs,” she added. “Generally speaking, people know the benefits of eating their five-a-day and of exercise for their physical and mental health, but there is very little awareness that cultural activities also have similar benefits,” she explained. “People engage with culture for the pure enjoyment of doing so, but we need to be raising awareness of their wider benefits too.” “Depression is a major issue affecting millions of people. If we are starting to feel low or isolated then cultural engagement is something simple that we can do to proactively help with our own mental health, before it gets to the point where we need professional medical help,” noted Fancourt.

Lisa Simek, one of the students’ parents, took to social media recently where she aired out her grievances over the teacher’s action. As per Simek, the teacher was in her 6-year-old daughter Emilia’s class where she asked the students which holiday was coming up before “completely” unleashing on them. “She told them Santa isn’t real and parents just buy presents and put them under their tree. She told them reindeer can’t fly and elves are not real…” Simek wrote on Facebook on Nov. 30. “The tooth fairy is not real because mom or dad just sneak into your room in the middle of the night and put money under your pillow, same goes for Easter bunny.” Simek added that the teacher told the children “magic does not exist” and “there is no such thing as magic anything.” “A grown woman tried to crush our six-year-old‘s spirit, along with the spirits of the other 22 kids in CH’s 1st Grade class,” the mom pointed out. She added that many of the parents have been doing damage control since the children returned home from school and wished, “Praying for a Christmas Magic miracle to keep these kids believers for as long as possible.” Despite the teacher’s action, however, Simek asked people to refrain from bashing her, saying they must all learn from the situation and that Christmas magic is indeed real. “Christmas magic is real and shown through acts of kindness, love, positivity and grace for/from loved ones as well as strangers,” she appealed. “Just be kind. When in doubt, always choose being kind, and you will always be in the right.” Meanwhile, Cedar High School principal Michael Raj apologized to the parents regarding the teacher’s action via a letter. Raj, as per WKRG on Dec. 2, sympathized with the parents, saying he was aware of the sensitive nature of the announcement as he is a parent himself. “I am sending this letter so that you are aware of the situation,” Raj said in the report. “If the conversation comes up at home over the next few days you can take appropriate steps to maintain the childhood innocence of the holiday season.” As of this writing, it still remains uncertain whether the teacher would continue teaching in the district.

"Depression could increase the risk of a heart flutter, finds new study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/315166/depression-could-increase-the-risk-of-a-heart-flutter-finds-new-study/,"04:10 PM November 26, 2018","New European research has found that depression is linked with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular, rapid heart rate also known as a heart flutter. Led by researchers at Aarhus University, Denmark, the new study looked at 785,254 Danish citizens who started antidepressant treatment between 2000 to 2013 and compared them to a control group. The researchers assessed the participants’ risk of atrial fibrillation the month before starting treatment, when it was assumed that patients were depressed but medically untreated, and after starting treatment. The findings, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, showed that antidepressant medication was associated with a three-fold higher risk of atrial fibrillation during the first month of treatment, although this association gradually reduced over the following year to a 1.37-fold higher risk at 2 to 6 months, and 1.11-fold at 6 to 12 months. However, the risk of atrial fibrillation risk was even higher in the month before starting antidepressants, a 7.65-fold higher risk, suggesting that antidepressant medication was not responsible for the high frequency of atrial fibrillation found in depressed people. “It is common knowledge that there is a connection between the mind and the heart. Depression predicts the development of coronary artery disease and worsens its prognosis,” said study author Morten Fenger-Grøn. “Filling a prescription for antidepressants, which we used as an indicator of depression, was associated with a three-fold greater risk of atrial fibrillation. The decrease with time could suggest that treatment may alleviate this risk,” said Fenger-Grøn. “This suggests that antidepressant medication itself is not associated with the development of atrial fibrillation. If you are depressed, there is no reason to worry that taking drug treatment will cause atrial fibrillation,” the author explained. “The message for patients who already have atrial fibrillation is that you do not need to be concerned about taking antidepressant medication if you need it.” added Fenger-Grøn. “Look after your mental health because our study supports existing evidence that problems with the mind can be detrimental for the heart.” Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder, and causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes as well as increasing the risk of other conditions such as dementia, heart attack and kidney disease, and premature death. Symptoms include chest pain, a “racing” or unusual heartbeat palpitations, weakness, fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness and shortness of breath.

A recent study published in the BMJ (British Medical Journal) says that type 2 diabetes can be controlled with a plant-based diet. There are two principal kinds of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes usually occurs in children, whose immune systems destroy their pancreatic beta cells, depriving them of the ability to produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes is generally diagnosed in patients aged over 40, and is often associated with the lifestyle factors of excessive body weight and insufficient exercise. Type 2 diabetes patients are typically characterized by insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly, leading to a lack of insulin in the later stages of the disease. According to a recent study published by Anastasios Toumpanakis, Triece Turnbull, and Isaura Alba-Barba in the “Diabetes, Research & Care” section of the BMJ, plant-based diets can effectively reduce the risks associated with type 2 diabetes, while also promoting good mental and cardiovascular health. The researchers conducted a meta-analysis of data from several studies published between 1999 and 2017 on the impact of plant-based diets on health, which yielded a sample of 433 diabetes sufferers. The results indicated that patients following a plant-based diet were the only ones to report an improvement in both their psychological and physical well-being. With regard to their mental health, symptoms of depression were significantly reduced among patients adopting a plant-based regimen. They also benefited from reduced physical symptoms, with lower levels of perceived pain and neuropathy, and lower plantar foot temperatures. Average fasting blood sugar levels also decreased among patients following a plant-based diet. At the same time, these patients lost twice as much weight as those following diets that included animal protein. Their blood counts for lipids were also significantly decreased, with a consequent reduction in their exposure to cardiovascular risks. In the six studies analyzed, patients following a plant-based diet were able to stop taking medical treatments or reduce their dosage. Plant-based diets can thus make a major contribution to enhancing the well-being of diabetes patients, particularly for type 2 diabetes patients.

"Prince Harry, Meghan and ‘little bump’ go bush in New Zealand",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/311507/prince-harry-meghan-and-little-bump-go-bush-in-new-zealand/,"05:19 PM October 29, 2018","Prince Harry passed on greetings from “our little bump” to conservation workers in New Zealand Monday when he and pregnant wife Meghan toured a South Island nature reserve. The British royals’ arrival at the Abel Tasman National Park was heralded with blasts from a conch shell before a traditional Maori greeting. Amid heavy rain, Harry told the crowd he was grateful the weather was mild enough to allow the royal party to make the trip from the capital Wellington in a New Zealand Air Force NH90 helicopter. “The forecast was a lot worse than this so we are very, very glad to have made it,” he said. “The rain is a blessing on all of us… from my wife, myself and our little bump, we are so grateful to be here.” “We bring blessings from my grandmother, Her Majesty the Queen, and all of our family.” The couple then walked along the beach arm-in-arm talking to ranger Andrew Lamason. They came across a weka, with Lamason describing the flightless bird as New Zealand’s version of a monkey because of their cheeky nature. They then joined local schoolchildren for lunch, with Milan Chapman, 15, of Motueka High School, describing them as “very nice, chatty and relaxed.” Earlier, the pair expressed their admiration for mental health workers at a beachside morning tea in Wellington. Sitting alongside Meghan at the Maranui Cafe in Lyall Bay, Harry was unstinting in his praise for the gathered mental health advocates. “I take my hat off to you guys,” he told members of Voices of Hope, which aims to prevent youth suicide. “Everyone needs someone to turn to right?” Meghan, sipping from a cup of tea and wearing a grey Club Monaco trench coat to ward off the Wellington chill, added: “You’re all doing really excellent work.” The couple are in New Zealand on the final leg of a marathon 16-day tour which has also taken in Australia, Fiji and Tonga. The trip coincided with the 2018 Invictus Games in Sydney, an Olympic style sporting event for wounded soldiers that Harry helped found. At the Games’ closing ceremony on Saturday Harry spoke of the need to talk openly about anxiety, stress and depression, revealing his own struggles. “I’ve been there, you’ve been there, and we now need to reach out to those who can never even imagine themselves in that place,” he said. Meghan has also used her first royal tour since marrying Harry five months ago to promote her own favored causes, mainly female empowerment. After arriving in Wellington Sunday to a traditional Maori welcome, including pressing noses with elders in a hongi greeting, she spoke at a reception honoring 125 years since New Zealand became the first country to give women the vote. “Bravo New Zealand for championing this right 125 years ago — for the women who well deserve to have an active voice and acknowledged vote, and for all of the people that this effort has paved the way for globally,” she said.

For some, it even brings a sense of inner peace. Beyond Yoga adds to yoga’s many benefits through Yoga for Smiles, which aims to raise funds and awareness for leading cleft charity Smile Train. The program began last year and following its success, is back for a second run. The studio will host a Yoga for Smile class every Saturday in October, and one in November, to help the cause. Payment for the class will be based on one’s donation. Proceeds will help Smile Train in its mission to provide comprehensive cleft care for children in need, from surgery to speech therapy. Beyond Yoga encourages newbies and regular practitioners to join the classes, which it says practices the philosophy of seva or serving others from the heart. “Smile Train continues to inspire others with their commitment to helping give more children their forever smiles, and we look forward to using our platform within the yoga community,” said Benedict Bernabe, head of operations for Beyond Yoga. Yoga for Smiles classes are scheduled on Oct. 27, 2 p.m. at Tomas Morato, Quezon City and on Nov. 17, 9 a.m. at the Alabang branch. Participants are advised to email their preferred branch to reserve a slot.

15 lessons living with depression taught me,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/310544/15-lessons-living-with-depression-taught-me-2/,"12:46 PM October 21, 2018","I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety disorder in 2015. It made no sense. I couldn’t believe it. I was a happy person, I didn’t like being sad, how could I be depressed? Back then, there was so much I didn’t know.  These past three years have been a roller coaster ride of therapy, medication, relapse and recurrence, difficult days, beautiful days and so many lessons.  Here are some of them. 1. The stigma exists. And we need to fight it. 2. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness. 3. Mental illness is not something to be ashamed of. 4. Depression lies. It will tell you things you shouldn’t believe. That you’re a burden. That you’re not worth it. That things will never get better. Do not believe it. 5. Depression doesn’t always look the same. 6. There are many weapons against it. Therapy and medication are jus two of them. 7. People will surprise you. Sometimes in bad ways but more often in good. 8. Listen to your doctor. Stop being stubborn. 9. Talking makes a difference. 10. It doesn’t matter who you are, you can make a difference. 11. It’s okay not to be okay. I realized that I had been pressuring myself to be 100% fine all the time and I had to remind myself that even people without depression have bad days. Sometimes, you have to let yourself be not okay. Sometimes, you have to let yourself have that day of doing nothing, of just curling up in bed with Netflix. I call those my mental health days. 12. You are not alone. 13. Things will get better. 14. You can be depressed and still live a full life. 15. Depression is not a death sentence. It’s not a life sentence. It’s a battle.

Royals Harry and Meghan go barefoot on Bondi,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/310310/royals-harry-and-meghan-go-barefoot-on-bondi/,"01:55 PM October 19, 2018","British royals Harry and Meghan kicked off their shoes and donned tropical garlands Friday as they hit Sydney’s famed Bondi beach for the latest stop on their Australian tour. Expectant Meghan put on a summer dress and set aside her high heels, while Harry ditched his usual suit for chinos as the couple lapped up cheers from Australian fans and enjoyed Bondi’s surf. Despite morning fog, the pair met local surfers enjoying winter swells and sat down on the sand for a long chat with leaders of the OneWave group, which focuses on helping people improve mental health by getting outdoors. Signs screaming “G’day Harry and Meghan” greeted the royal couple, who have received a warm welcome from fans throughout the start of their 16-day pacific tour. “You hear people that met the Queen when she came here (in 1954),” said 26-year-old fan Christopher Cundle. “And they are still talking about it now. “I can easily see that that is one of the things I will be talking to my grandkids and future generations about. It was awesome.” While half of Australians oppose having British monarchs as head of state, and the vast majority of citizens have carried on with business as usual during the visit, there has been sizable support for the celebrity couple at every stop. News that the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant has only made the crowds swell. She is the favorite royal of 11-year-old schoolgirl Mya. “I actually think it is amazing that she actually got to meet Harry and fall in love with him.” Amid a torrent of fawning press coverage declaring Meghan the “Queen of Hugs” and the prince receiving “buckets of love,” the Australian Republican Movement is putting on a brave face. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very welcome visitors” the group said at the start of the trip, pointedly adding that “Australians of all ages know the difference between this wonderful event and the questions of our nation’s identity and future.” In a 1999 referendum, 55 percent of Australians voted against replacing Queen Elizabeth II as head of state, although polls indicate support for republicanism has grown since then. The opposition Labor party has promised a plebiscite on the issue if it wins a general election expected in 2019. Later on Friday the prince will scale the Sydney Harbour Bridge and hoist a flag to open the Invictus Games, a sports championship for wounded military personnel. On Monday the pair will go to Queensland’s Fraser Island, the world’s largest sand island, before jetting off to Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.

"Japan, Thailand, US are the most vacation deprived, says report",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/310112/p2fb-japan-thailand-us-vacation-deprived-says-report/,"10:16 PM October 17, 2018","The world is tired, as global vacation deprivation is on the rise, with workers in Japan, Thailand and the United States taking the fewest number of vacation days in the world, according to the latest report from Expedia. That’s the overarching takeaway from the 18th edition of the Vacation Deprivation study, which found that globally, 58 percent of workers describe themselves as very or somewhat vacation deprived, up from 53 percent last year, and 49 percent in 2016. Of the 19 countries studied, Japanese, Thai and American workers were found to take the fewest number of vacation days at 10 days a year. Over in the U.S., the latest figures show that of the 14 vacation days allotted, Americans only use up 10 on average, resulting in the equivalent of 653.9 million days left on the table. Overall, vacation deprivation levels among Americans are at a five-year high at 59 percent, up 8 percent from 2017. The biggest reason? Money, money, money, of course. Americans who haven’t taken a holiday in the last six months cited financial reasons for not using up their vacation. More than half (54 percent) said they feel like they can’t afford a trip, up 11 percent from last year. Another reason that Americans may be going longer between vacations is that they’re banking their days to take longer holidays, says Expedia. The report also found that mental health has become a growing priority for American holidaymakers. The majority (91 percent) agreed that they vacation to hit the reset button on stress and anxiety. “A wellness-centric trip doesn’t have to mean a spa or yoga retreat, although those are popular options,” said spokesperson Nisreene Atassi in a statement. “For most of us, recharging simply means we need to disconnect and slow down,” Atassi added. “Whether it’s a family vacation or a solo escape, set rules about how often you’re allowed to check email and try not to overschedule your days.” JB RELATED STORIES: Where to go this holiday season when you’re on a budget  Can vacations help you live longer?

Prince Harry and Meghan bring rain to drought-stricken Aussie town,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/310069/prince-harry-meghan-bring-rain-drought-stricken-aussie-town/,"05:08 PM October 17, 2018","DUBBO, Australia (AP) — The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were jokingly thanked for bringing England’s notoriously inclement weather to a drought-stricken Outback town on Wednesday in a rain-drenched visit to Dubbo during their Australian royal tour. The former Meghan Markle brought banana bread that she baked in Sydney on Tuesday as a gift to a farming family outside Dubbo who were struggling to feed their cattle and sheep through two years of below-average rain. The pregnant American former actress and her husband, Prince Harry, got their hands dirty throwing cotton seed onto hay used to feed the cows because of a lack of pasture. Heavy rain started falling when the royal couple arrived later at a Dubbo park for a community picnic, but hundreds of cheering well-wishers remained enthusiastic. The crowd laughed when Mayor Ben Shields said in a speech: “As your Royal Highnesses are aware, our region has been hit by a terrible drought. So we’re very pleased that you can bring some of that English weather with you today, and hopefully it will bring some relief to the farming families.” While rain in recent weeks has been welcome, much more is needed to repair the economic and environmental ravages of the extended dry spell. Meghan held an umbrella over Harry as he gave a speech, acknowledging the hardships the drought brought to the rural community and urging drought victims not to suffer in silence. The crowd applauded when Harry touched on his own mental health struggles following the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a car crash in a Paris tunnel in 1997. He was 12 at the time. Harry, now 34, revealed in an interview last year that he did not seek counseling until he was in his late 20s. “You are all in this together and, if I may speak personally, we are all in this together,” Harry said. “Because asking for help was one of the best decisions that I ever made. You will be continually amazed how life changes for the better.” The prince ended by thanking Dubbo for its invitation and for sharing the stories, adding, “And the rain was a gift.” Harry and his Meghan are on a 16-day tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. The main focus of the tour is the Invictus Games, which start in Sydney on Saturday. The sporting event, founded by Harry in 2014, gives sick and injured military personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball. NVG RELATED STORIES: Prince Harry and Meghan start Aussie tour with baby gifts Prince Harry in another catch-up with war widow in Sydney  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.

Meghan Markle’s half-sister apologizes on TV after failed visit to see duchess in London,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/308287/p2fb-meghan-markles-half-sister-apologizes-tv-failed-visit-see-duchess-london/,"07:33 PM October 02, 2018","The Markle family drama continues. This time, it’s Meghan Markle’s half-sister Samantha, 53, who flew to London to face the press. Samantha works as a mental health consultant and has multiple sclerosis. She has also been vocal in her insults against the Duchess of Sussex on Twitter, using names such as “ducha**” and “Cruella de Vil” to refer to her. She appeared on Jeremy Vine’s self-titled talk show on Channel 5 where she displayed a more mellow disposition compared to her online rants. She disputed that she and her sister had been estranged for a decade, stating that they had last spoken three years ago. “I wanted to make the trip and sort of speak the wishes and thoughts and sentiments of my father, and hopefully get a message to my sister,” said Samantha on her expectations of the London visit. She said there was “so much misperception” about the family ordeal and put the blame on “media madness” for Meghan’s cold shoulder towards her father. However, she did not express regret for advising her father to stage paparazzi pictures before the May wedding even if it may have affected Meghan’s relationship with Thomas Markle. She said the money he received from it was “not very much” and she didn’t know what other option there was when media allegedly portrayed him as a “slob.” And when it came to her scathing tweets, she brushed off some of them as jokes and stated that she was merely being protective of their father. Her tweets include one last August where she calls Meghan “Witchy Poo” and tagged the Royal Family’s Twitter handle @KensingtonRoyal. Samantha set out for Buckingham Palace with no luck in seeing her sister. Meghan and Prince Harry currently reside in Nottingham Cottage in Kensington Palace. When asked to give a message if she was able to see her sister, she said, “I think everybody was hurt at not being included or invited to the wedding.” Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, was the Duchess’ only relative at the ceremony. “But I felt as though it could have all been nipped in the bud had everyone been included and we all agreed to move forward with positive resolve, and the hurt feelings wouldn’t have snowballed.” “But believe it or not, it doesn’t mean we love you any less,” she said. “Moving forward I apologize and I wish things could be different.” The Duchess of Sussex and the British royal family have yet to respond to her half-sister’s statements.

Working nights may increase a woman’s risk of breast cancer,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/306522/p2fb-working-nights-may-increase-womans-risk-breast-cancer/,"09:33 PM September 17, 2018","According to new international research, working at night could increase a woman’s risk of breast cancer, especially in those who are pre-menopause. Carried out by Canadian, Australian, and European researchers, the new study surveyed more than 13,000 women aged on average 55 to 59 from five different countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany and Spain). The participants included 6,093 women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and 6,933 women without breast cancer who acted as controls. The findings, which were published in the European Journal of Epidemiology, suggested that the risk of developing breast cancer increases with the number of hours worked per night, as well as the number of years spent on the night shift. Women who worked at least three hours between midnight and 5 a.m. every night had a 12 percent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who had never worked at night. Among pre-menopausal women, this risk increases to 26 percent. In addition, the team also found that pre-menopausal women who work night shifts longer than 10 hours showed a 36 percent increased risk of breast cancer compared to those who have never worked nights, with the risk as high as 80 percent among women who work night shifts longer than 10 hours for more than three nights per week. However, the risk appeared to decrease two years after stopping night shift work, with women who were still working nights at the time of the study showing a breast cancer risk 26 percent higher than those who had stopped working at night at least two years previously. Although the analysis of the five surveys did not specifically consider the type of night work, the Canadian survey did compare women working in healthcare and other sectors. “The risk associated with breast cancer and night work varied little among respondents, regardless of job type,” explained study co-author Anne Grundy, from the Université de Montréal. “Although we are not fully certain, we believe that this risk could be related to the hypothesis that night work disrupts circadian rhythm and inhibits the secretion of melatonin, which may protect against cancer,” she added. The researchers also added that further research should be carried out to investigate the difference in risk between pre- and post- menopausal women.

Carried out by researchers at the University of Western Australia, the new study surveyed 214 young adults about four characteristics that both men and women usually look for in a partner: intelligence, easygoingness, kindness and physical attractiveness. The participants were asked how attracted they would be to a potential partner who was more intelligent than 1 percent, 10 percent, 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent and 99 percent of the population. They were then asked the same question for each of the other three personality traits. The results showed that how attractive “kindness” and “physical attractiveness” were rated plateaued at the 90th percentile, with lead author Gilles Gignac commenting, “So, on average, there doesn’t appear to be any gain to being exceptionally kind or exceptionally physically attractive in the context of attracting a romantic partner.” However, the study suggests that it may be possible to be too intelligent or too easygoing, with the researchers finding that there was a statistically significant reduction in how attractive intelligence and easygoingness were rated at the 99th percentile, compared to the 90th percentile. “Previously published research suggests that elevated levels of intelligence may incite feelings of insecurity in some people, which may reduce desirability,” explained Gignac. “Correspondingly, exceptional easygoingness may be viewed as an indication of a lack of confidence or ambition.” When looking at differences between genders, the findings implied that females value kindness and intelligence in a potential partner more than males. However, overall, the differences were small, with the study finding that men and women are essentially similar with respect to how desirable they rate intelligence, physical attraction, easygoingness and kindness. How attractive each of the four characteristics was rated to be was also similar whether participants were rating the trait as a sexually attractive characteristic or for a long-term relationship. The findings can be found published online in the British Journal of Psychology.

Carried out by researchers at the University of Otago, New Zealand, and the University of Prince Edward Island and University of Guelph in Canada, the review analyzed 44 studies which had recruited healthy males and females of all ages, to compare the impact of prolonged sitting for up to 24 hours against interrupted sitting, using various health markers. These markers included postprandial glucose (glucose measured after a meal, a spike in which can indicate difficulty in metabolizing carbohydrates and producing insulin), insulin (high levels of which can indicate insulin resistance and contribute to conditions such as diabetes), and triglycerides (a fat lipid in the blood, which is an important marker of heart health). The researchers found that compared to prolonged sitting, taking regular breaks to perform short, repeated bouts of activity lowered concentrations of blood sugar and insulin in the bloodstream for up to nine hours after a meal. Concentrations of triglycerides in the blood also decreased, although this effect seems to be delayed, only occurring 12 to 16 hours after the activity. “The current physical activity guidelines to sit less and move more apply to everyone,” said study author Dr. Meredith Peddie. “Most of us spend about 75 percent of our day sitting or being sedentary, and this behavior has been linked to increased rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some cancers and overall mortality.” “We should all be finding ways to avoid sitting for long periods, and to increase the amount of movement we do throughout the entire day,” she added. Dr. Peddie addded that the most interesting finding from the review is that the levels of the reductions in blood sugar, insulin or fat do not appear to be affected by the intensity of the activity performed, what you have eaten, how old you are, or how much you weigh. However, the authors did note that more research is needed to identify the most beneficial timing, duration and mode of activity break. The findings were published online in the journal Sports Medicine.

Father of 2 suffers injuries after trying to save son’s life in 13-foot fall,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/303285/father-of-2-suffers-injuries-after-breaking-sons-13-foot-fall/,"03:49 PM August 18, 2018","A father of two from Sydney, Australia, got sent to the hospital after he tried to minimize the impact of his son’s 13-foot fall from a balcony. Brad Lewis, 42, suffered multiple injuries when he tried to save his son from falling off a balcony at a friend’s house. Brad had been playing with his 8-year-old son Oscar with a Nerf gun when one of the toy bullets flew off from the balcony. Oscar ran to retrieve the bullet but lost his balance and tumbled over the railing. Brad ran to his son but he couldn’t keep himself from falling as well. To protect the boy from injury, Brad curled himself around Oscar until they hit the concrete driveway below, according to a GoFundMe post. Thanks to Brad’s quick thinking, Oscar was only knocked out during the fall but still received a fractured skull. Brad, on the other hand, suffered from fractured skull, brain bruising, fractured vertebra and other injuries. Doctors said he might need six to 12 months of recovery in the hospital. Beau, Brad’s friend who rushed to his side after hearing the fall, recalled the few words the heroic father could muster. “Are the kids OK? Don’t let them see me like this. Don’t let me die,” said Brad. With Brad’s safety already in check, the Lewis family faced a long road of financial challenges. According to the GoFundMe post made by Bianca Park on Aug.8, the family needed around $150,000 (about P8 million) to cover numerous costs including medical bills, transportation, and other daily necessities. Suz, Brad’s wife, had to take time off from work to care for her husband and son. So far $81,201 has been raised for Brad, about half of the needed amount to help his family survive. As for Brad himself, the most recent update from Aug. 14, said he had been moved from the intensive care unit to Head Trauma. “I think any father would have done it for their child if put in the same situation,” said Brad in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. “I sit here now thanking my lucky stars Oscar and I are both here and are moving forward.” Meanwhile, Oscar now sleeps with 6 pillows around him for fear of falling off his bed. According to the report, he’s already back in school but will only do half-days for a while.  /ra  RELATED STORIES: Tunisia anti-litter activist takes up 300-km, 30-beach challenge 2 men with mental health issues escape care home to party Japanese man delays train service after getting head stuck under seats  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018

The 27-year-old sanitary engineer set out in July to walk a 300-kilometer (185-mile) stretch of coastline in northern Tunisia and clean up 30 beaches along the way. He hopes the two-month trek will help convince authorities, holidaymakers and average Tunisians alike that the sea should not be used as a giant landfill. With a sturdy pair of boots and a hat to shield him from the summer sun, Houij began his journey in the central coastal city of Mahdia and plans to finish in Solimane, 40 kilometers from the capital Tunis. The trip will take him through crowded hotspots like Daar Chaabane in Nabeul, but also along secluded coves and shores. “I believe in citizen mobilization and I chose to act… and to raise awareness about the problem of pollution on our beaches,” the activist told AFP. The Facebook page of his “300 Kilometers” campaign has more than 13,000 followers and is entirely independent, he boasted. “No political party is welcome… 300 Kilometers is a free citizen initiative and will remain forever,” the activist wrote on the page. ‘Drop of water’ But while Houij may be a dreamer, he is also realistic. “The 300 Kilometers action is not really about cleaning… I know I’m just a drop of water in the ocean,” he said. “I want to raise public awareness and get people thinking: ‘Wait, it’s not normal, all these bottles, these caps… all these plastic bags’.” Since Tunisia’s 2011 revolution, the proliferation of waste has steadily worsened across the country — in big cities, rural areas and beaches alike. One contributing factor has been the absence of elected municipal councils. Between the fall in 2011 of longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and local polls held in May 2018, town halls were managed by “special delegations” that often neglected issues like littering and waste management. But there is also a lack of environmental awareness among Tunisians, Environment Minister Riadh Mouakher said in mid-2017 as he announced the launch of a special “green police” unit to combat the North African country’s rubbish woes. At his first beach stop, Oussama estimates he collected about 100 kilograms (more than 200 pounds) of waste. After that, he simply stopped weighing the bags. Nearly 150 kilometers and 14 beaches later, Houij is astounded by the sheer volume of waste he’s found along the shore. “We’re talking tonnes of rubbish… The more you clean, the more you find.

Sleeping rough From plastic bottles and soiled diapers to commercial refuse, Oussama says he’s seen “all forms of pollution” seeping into the sea. “I’ve seen a wide array of pollution, from the personal pollution of people who come to the beach through to the industrial pollution” of local and public companies, he said. “The authorities do not take the problem of pollution in Tunisia seriously,” said Houij. The environmental activist is also frustrated with holidaymakers who treat him as a “zabel” (rubbish collector) and don’t hesitate to ask him to pick up their waste. Traveling with nothing but a rucksack and a guitar, on lucky nights he is offered shelter and a bed. Most nights, though, he sleeps rough. Reactions from those he meets along the way range “from one extreme to another”, he said. “There are people who are very active, who encourage you and who help you clean up… but others kill your desire to work for the cause,” he added. “Each day brings enough trouble of its own, but the will is there… there’s no reason for me to stop.” AB RELATED STORIES: 2 men with mental health issues escape care home to party Participants in travel race drive Prague subway train Japanese politician to sell self-published comics at annual comic book market  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
Japanese politician to sell self-published comics at annual comic book market,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/302619/japanese-politician-sell-self-published-comics-annual-comic-book-market/,"04:37 PM August 10, 2018","A Japanese politician from Tokyo will make an appearance at the summer Comic Market to sell his self-published comics. Comic Market, more commonly known as Comiket, is held twice a year–one in winter and another in summer. The event hosts hundreds of artists who sell self-published comics, or doujins. Topics for these doujins can range from wholesome to adults-only material. Many are also fan works of existing manga or anime series. Minoru Ogino, the 32-year-old assemblyman from Tokyo’s Ota Ward or Ota-Ku, also happens to be an anime fan and doujin creator, or an otaku or someone who fancies anime-related media. Even as he was elected into office in 2015, Ogino continued with his passion and will be selling the second volume of one of his doujins, which is based on the video game franchise “Touhou Project,” according to IT Media via SoraNews24. Comiket started on Aug. 9 and will run until Aug. 12. Ogino will only be at the event’s last day, Sunday. He has participated in Comiket four times since his election. Ogino’s approach with his creations actually reflects his current occupation. Through one of the cute and immortal Touhou Project characters, Ogino tried to educate readers of Japan’s modern governmental system and electoral processes. For an educational piece, the artwork appeared clean and well-made. Ogino credited the artwork to a separate artist. The assemblyman himself had taken courses in manga drawing, but his official duties don’t afford him the kind of time that other doujin makers have. One copy of Ogino’s new work costs 600 yen or around P280. Outside of Comiket, Ogino also sells his previous works on the online doujin specialty stores Tora no Ana and Melon Books. Ogino also maintains his own blog where he posts updates on his latest works.

 Participants in travel race drive Prague subway train,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/302561/%e2%80%a8participants-travel-race-drive-prague-subway-train/,"05:00 PM August 09, 2018","PRAGUE (AP) — Two participants in a travel competition were allowed by a driver to drive a subway train carrying passengers in the Czech capital, an incident the Prague Transport Authority called “unacceptable.” As part of the LowCost Race that takes two-member teams with a limited budget across Europe, the two faced a challenge to “drive something unusual” as the race started on Aug. 3. A video they took that was posted on the organizer’s web site shows one of them driving the train while the driver they called Martin was giving her instructions what to do. Prague Transport Authority spokeswoman Aneta Rehkova says it was a failure of the driver and a serious breach of working rules. The driver is facing an unspecified punishment. Rehkova says the passengers’ security was not threatened. Race spokesman Miky Skoda say he is happy nothing serious happened and claimed the organizers did not encourage the two to drive the subway train. Prague police spokesman Jan Danek says they are investigating the case.

Invasive beetle threatens Japanese cherry blossom trees,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/302519/invasive-beetle-threatens-japanese-cherry-blossom-trees/,"02:21 PM August 09, 2018","An invasive beetle species has pushed Japanese local governments to take measures to protect the country’s iconic sakura trees. Sakura, or cherry blossom, trees are in danger, thanks to an invasive insect species called the red-necked longhorn beetle. The beetles are believed to have made their way to Japanese shores via cargo ships from either China or the Korean Peninsula. Because the beetle has no natural predator in Japan, its population runs the danger of exploding, as reported by the Asahi Shimbun via SoraNews24. The red-necked longhorn beetle is able to lay around 300 eggs, which it places in cracks found along the trunks of sakura and ume (plum blossom) trees. When the eggs hatch, larvae start to feed on the tree from the inside out. Furthermore, the place where the larvae feed at is on the path where nutrients pass through. In effect, an infected tree will wither away from malnutrition while being eaten from the inside in a span of three years. Given the status of sakura and ume trees as being among the main tourist attractions in Japan, this invasive insect poses a very serious threat. Not to mention it may also affect the plum production in the country. To combat their spread, local governments around Japan started offering bounty for the invasive beetle. Sakai City in Osaka started an open call for “black hunters” to report sightings of the red-necked longhorn beetle for a free gift. They required a photo, location and time of the sighting. The city government also requested that the beetles be killed after documenting the sighting. Meanwhile, Tokushima prefecture began offering a 500 yen (about P240) for each beetle turned in. However, it appears this offer only applied to local university students.  Alfred Bayle /ra  RELATED STORIES: Japanese man delays train service after getting head stuck under seats 2 men with mental health issues escape care home to party WATCH: Sunset turns Osaka sky into work of art  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
Solenn Heussaff gives tips and tricks on designing a home without help from a pro,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/302059/p2fb-solenn-heussaff-gives-tips-and-tricks-on-designing-a-home-without-help-from-a-pro/,"03:08 PM August 05, 2018","Solenn Heussaff has preferred doing things on her own, whether it’s housework, applying makeup, or getting busy with her latest project — designing the new home which she shares with husband Nico Bolzico. Heussaff, 33, is all about the DIY life. She revealed this in her latest vlog, where she toured viewers through her multi-story home, and in the process admitting that she did not hire an interior designer “for the first time.” Her eye for beauty and art helped her create spaces which have a cohesive theme while still giving each room its own identity. “I believe a house has to be a home. It has to feel cozy and personal,” she shared in her blog. Even as an actress and endorser, Heussaff emphasized that sticking to a budget was a concern. She said that the house was four years old, and she decided to renovate it rather than build from scratch to cut costs. The house has high ceilings and is accented with wood, while rooms are decorated with Heussaff’s “homey, jungle-y, Havana, Moroccan” style. She emphasized checking the basics in a home before decorating. “Check/fix anything electrical, and check on the piping and drainage,” she wrote, noting in the vlog that she showered in cold water for a week because the electrical supply had to be fixed. “The cheapest home decorating tool is paint! A fresh coat of paint always brightens up a house or a room,” she said. Most of her walls were painted white, making it easy to decorate and to add accents. With decorating, she said, “Don’t get so focused about all your stuff being in one color.” She played around with just a few colors for the walls, furniture and decor—mainly beige, black, orange and blue. Pictures, paintings and memorabilia fill walls and shelves to give a personal touch to their home. Plants are carefully placed to literally give life to a room, even bathrooms. Heussaff cited Nest Plant Studio in decorating spaces with the right type of indoor plant depending on where sunlight hits the room. If there is anything to spend on, Heussaff advised investing in mattresses and kitchen appliances such as a refrigerator and a stove. “The most important thing in your life is sleep,” she said. “Invest in a good bed…it will last you at least 10 years.” For homes with balconies or outdoor spaces, she gave a tip of putting fake turf to spruce it up. She also decorated it with bamboo and other plants for a refreshing view. “If you have a little more money to spend, try to have an accent piece in every room,” she said. Her home has more personality with chandeliers, a wall accented with wallpaper or a colorful design and bathrooms with decorative mirrors. Although she isn’t expecting, Heussaff gave a peek into what would be the baby’s room. Because she doesn’t want to “jinx” having a baby, she said she would use it first as an art studio or place a treadmill in it. For now, she and Bolzico are committed to caring for their pets — a turtle named Patato, a cat named Negroni and a dog named Pochola. She revealed that Patato would be getting his own home too which will have a pool and a bedroom — and maybe another home tour could be set for their dear turtle’s little house.

"Dementia risk higher for middle-aged non-drinkers, study suggests",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/301797/p2fb-dementia-risk-higher-for-middle-aged-non-drinkers-study-suggests/,"06:24 PM August 02, 2018","While chronic heavy drinking was found to be linked to a higher risk for dementia, a new study suggests that people who abstain from drinking in middle age are also more likely to develop the disease. A research team from University College London and French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, Inserm, found that non-drinkers have a higher risk of developing dementia later in life. The study was published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) yesterday, Aug. 1. The research, which began in the mid-1980s, tracked the health of over 9,000 people aged 33 to 55 years over the years since the its inception. Researchers traced participants’ health records for dementia using the databases of the national hospital episode statistics, the Mental Health Services Data Set, and the mortality register. The study affirmed the earlier finding that high alcohol consumption (drinking more than the recommended 14 units of beer, equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer per week) is linked to an increased risk for the illness. Researchers found out a seven-unit increase in alcohol consumption was associated with a 17 percent higher risk for the disease. Perhaps the most important contribution of the recently published research, however, was the discovery that doing the exact opposite of excessive drinking — abstinence from alcohol consumption in middle-age — is a factor for developing the illness as well. Moreover, the study showed that “excess risk of dementia in abstainers was attributable to the greater risk of cardiometabolic disease” for middle-aged non-drinkers. “These results suggest that abstention and excessive alcohol consumption are associated with an increased risk of dementia, although the underlying mechanisms are likely to be different in the two groups,” the research concluded. “Overall, no evidence was found that alcohol consumption between one unit per week and 14 units per week increases the risk of dementia.” Researchers stressed that the study is limited to the participants’ alcohol consumption in middle-age. This being said, earlier consumption may contribute to higher dementia risk, as the illness “involves neuropathological changes over many years, perhaps decades.” JB RELATED STORIES: Dementia clearly linked to chronic boozing – study Drinking alcohol moderately can protect your heart, study finds  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
Science Says: What makes something truly addictive,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/298122/science-says-makes-something-truly-addictive/,"02:38 PM June 21, 2018","  CHICAGO — Now that the world’s leading public health group has said too much Minecraft can be an addiction, could overindulging in chocolate, exercise, or even sex, be next?  The short answer is probably not.  The new “gaming disorder” classification from the World Health Organization (WHO) has revived a debate in the medical community about whether behaviors can cause the same kind of addictive illness as drugs.  The strictest definition of addiction refers to a disease resulting from changes in brain chemistry caused by the compulsive use of drugs or alcohol. The definition includes excessive use that damages health, relationships, jobs, and other parts of normal life.  Brain research supports that definition, and some imaging studies have suggested that excessive gaming might affect the brain in similar ways.  Under a looser definition, addiction is considered “a disease of extreme behavior. Any behavior carried to the extreme that consumes you and keeps you from doing what you should be doing becomes an addiction as far as life is concerned,” said Dr. Walter Ling, a UCLA psychiatrist.  In its widely used manual for diagnosing mental illness, the American Psychiatric Association has called excessive video gaming as a “condition” but not a formal diagnosis or disease and has also said more research is needed to determine if it qualifies as an addiction.  Drugs and the brain  Certain drugs including opioids and alcohol can over-activate the brain’s reward circuit. That is the system that under normal circumstances is activated when people engage in “behaviors conducive to survival” including eating and drinking water when thirsty, explained Dr. Andrew Saxon, chairman of the association’s addiction psychiatry council.  The brain chemical dopamine regulates these behaviors but narcotic drugs can flood the brain with dopamine, encouraging repeated use and making drug use more rewarding that healthy behaviors, Saxon said.  Eventually, increasing amounts are needed to get the same effect, and brain changes lead to an inability to control use.  What about other substances?  Caffeine is a stimulant and also activates the brain’s reward system but to a much lesser degree than addictive drugs. The “reward” can make people feel more alert, and frequent users can develop mild withdrawal symptoms when they stop, including headaches and tiredness. Caffeine-containing chocolate may produce similar effects. Neither substance causes the kinds of life problems found in drug addiction although some coffee drinkers develop a tolerance to caffeine and need to drink more to get the same “buzz” or sense of alertness.  The WHO recognizes caffeine “dependence” as a disorder; the American Psychiatric Association does not and has said more research is needed.  “The term ‘addiction’ is tossed around pretty commonly, like ‘chocoholic’ or saying you’re addicted to reality TV,” said Dr. Ellen Selkie, a University of Michigan physician, who studies teens’ use of digital technology.  But addiction means an inability to control use “to the point where you’re failing at life,” she also said.  What about behavior?  The only behavior classified as an addiction in the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic manual is compulsive gambling. To be diagnosed, gamblers must have several symptoms including repeatedly gambling increasing amounts of money, lying to hide gambling activity, feeling irritable or restless when trying to stop, and losing jobs or relationships because of gambling.  Research has suggested excessive gambling can affect the brain in ways similar to addictive drugs. Since the diagnostic manual was last updated, in 2013, studies have bolstered evidence that excessive video gaming may do the same thing, and some experts speculated that it may be added to the next update.  The manual does not include sex addiction because there was little evidence that compulsive sexual behavior has similar effects on the brain.  Many excessive gamblers, gamers, and sex “addicts” have other psychiatric conditions, including anxiety, attention deficit disorder, and depression, and some mental health specialists believed their compulsive behaviors were merely symptoms of those diseases rather than separate addictions.  Does the term matter?  The WHO’s decision to classify excessive video gaming as an addiction means “gaming disorder” will be added to this year’s update to the organization’s International Classification of Diseases. Doctors worldwide use that document to diagnose physical and mental illnesses. Insurers, including Medicaid and Medicare, use billing codes listed there to make coverage decisions.  The American Psychiatric Association’s manual is widely used for defining and diagnosing mental disorders. If conditions are not listed in these documents, insurance coverage for treatment is unlikely.            /kga  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER. Prove your humanity",2018
Asia prepares to roll out mat for ‘International Yoga Day’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/297937/asia-prepares-roll-mat-international-yoga-day/,"02:17 PM June 20, 2018","Millions of people around the world will roll out their yoga mats on June 21 to mark the fourth edition of International Yoga Day.  Yoga Day was designated by the UN in 2015 on the insistence of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – himself an ardent practitioner. Yoga is an important part of Indian culture and was first made popular in the west by Swami Vivekenanda when he spoke about it at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1894.  However, yoga is much older – almost 2,500 years to date, and was practiced by the religiously inclined yogis in ancient India.  It became hugely popular in the 1960s’ west, with several versions of yoga and meditation surfacing in the decades that followed. The Beatles got inspired by yoga and Indian spiritualism which eventually prompted many westerners to spend time in Indian ashrams.  Though yoga is timeless new dimensions have been added to it. The newest fad is called Beer Yoga – hopefully propagating the basic yogic principle of harmonious working of the entire body – physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual.  Given its soaring popularity across the globe and indeed Asia – India has instructed its embassies and high commissions to observe Yoga Day in as many as 192 countries. Here’s looking at how popular yoga is in Asia.  China  China Daily reported that yoga fever has gripped the country with thousands of Chinese readying to participate in scores of events across the country to mark Yoga Day.  This, according to officials, will be the second biggest celebrations of the day in the world after India.  India’s economic archrival kicked off the celebrations a week earlier – at a special function at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation headquarters. There has been an explosion of yoga schools across China and a study was even commissioned on China’s growing yoga industry, The Week reported.  Beijing’s iconic Great Wall as well as numerous parks, lakes and resorts across China have become venues for both official and unofficial yoga events being held with active support of Chinese government bodies.  Though yoga has become immensely popular over the years in China, vying with ancient indigenous physical fitness martial art form Tai Chi, it got an official sanction when Chinese Premier Li Keqiang joined Prime Minister Narendra Modi here in 2015 at a joint event during the latter’s visit.  China also backed India’s move in the UN to make June 21 as International Yoga Day, giving a fillip to hundreds of yoga clubs and organizations.  Thailand  Thailand is known for its tranquil yoga retreats and is a dream destination for yoga enthusiasts.  In Thailand, the Indian Embassy has decided to woo practitioners this year by offering free yoga mats, T-shirts and refreshments. The Embassy in Thailand even has an endorsement from Miss Thailand about the benefits of yoga, The Week reported.  The Nation reported earlier that dozens of female prisoners take a yoga class at Bangkok’s Klong Prem Central Prison. “I feel calm listening to the instructor’s voice, and as my muscles unwind, my heart lifts,” says a 30-year-old woman who’s serving time for murder.  Two of Asia’s top spots for a rejuvenating yoga retreat are in Thailand – Kamalaya in Koh Samui and the Sanctuary in Koh Phangan.  Apart from Thailand, Bhutan and Sri Lanka also boast scenic yoga retreats. Laos, too, has a beautiful yoga retreat and is popular with both novices and seasoned yogis.  Indonesia  In Indonesia, the International Day of Yoga has been celebrated three times. However, this year, the event is set be even bigger, backed by the support of the Tourism Ministry.  The inaugural event kicked off on April 22 at Malang Muhammadiyah University in Malang, East Java, and was followed by various events in Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Bandung, Bali, Surabaya and Medan, The Jakarta Post reported.  Tourism Minister Arief Yahya said in a statement that yoga was an exercise that focused on strength and breathing to improve one’s mental and physical state. The exercise has attracted many people, including Indonesians.  Indian Ambassador to Indonesia Pradeep Kumar Rawat has welcomed everyone to join the Yoga Day celebration.  The peak of the celebration is scheduled to be held at Prambanan Temple in Sleman, Yogyakarta, on June 24. This event is expected to be attended by 10,000 participants.  For the main celebrations, yoga instructors have been flown in from India.  South Korea  The Korea Herald reported that many Koreans are choosing to work out of home and also exercise at home.  “Without leaving the comforts of the home, people are able to carry out an extensive workout, proponents say. A wealth of home training videos available online allow those pressed for both money and time to stay fit with less hassle,” the report said.  What is interesting is that there has been a rise in sales of exercise equipment for those opting to break a sweat at home.  “In January, sales of yoga mats rose 36 percent at online retailer Gmarket compared to the previous month. Sales of yoga towels rose 276 percent, while sales of cycling machines rose 134 percent in the same period.”  Some opt for more whimsical routines — such as “Yoga With Your Dog.”  Pakistan, Bangladesh & Nepal  Yoga is becoming equally popular in Pakistan, even though many conservatives frown upon the practitioners. Yoga retreats are occasionally held in the foothills of the Himalayas.  A couple of years ago, Aisha Chapra, a young Pakistani woman, tried to bring peace and tranquillity into the lives of women prisoners in the southern port city of Karachi by teaching them yoga.  “…I began yoga and I often find myself sitting in a cross- legged, lotus position with my hands on my knees, palms facing upwards, trying to focus on being upright, silent and mindful of the present, both figuratively and physically while struggling with an avalanche of thoughts that clutter my head,” wrote a yoga practitioner in Dawn.  Speaking at a seminar on “Yoga: Nation in Motion” in the restive Balochistan province, yoga expert Wajahat Ali Afridi said depression and anxiety are on the rise in Pakistan as people refrain from exercises such as yoga, Dawn reported. The concept of corporate yoga to increase productivity at the workplace is gaining popularity in Bangladesh.  Speaking at a yoga and meditation camp, a mayor in Dhaka encouraged workers to take to yoga for a healthy life, The Daily Star reported.  Shazia Omar, a known yoga trainer in the country, says “yoga improves mental, psychological and physical health”.  “Mindfulness techniques can help people reduce stress. Meditation can help people relax. Breathing exercises can be used to calm or energise oneself. A regular yoga practice improves health (circulation, respiration, digestion, sleep and energy levels), increases core muscle strength (preventing back injuries and reducing back aches), leads to weight loss, raises immunity and reduces sickness,” she wrote in a piece for The Daily Star.  Yoga is equally popular in Nepal. “Embrace Yoga to fight your demons,” advices a piece in The Kathmandu Post. A yoga practitioner writes about his understanding of Yoga which was limited to stretching of limbs and breathing exercises and which changed when he enrolled for a three-month yoga program.  “…the main purpose of yoga is liberation—meaning the freedom from Kleshas.”  Klesha, a sanskrit word, refers to the intrinsic states of mind such as greed, jealousy, pride, anger, and fear among others, he explains.  Malaysia, Cambodia & Vietnam  The Star reported that 40 students took part in a yoga program recently to get help with self-development.  “..the pupils were taught the basics of the body’s structure, capability of the mind, breathing exercise, stress management and a healthy diet,” event organizing chairman W. Murugan told The Star.  “We also held short meditation sessions alternately with games and other activities, including discussion sessions,” he added.  Cambodia has been organizing mass yoga events for the past few years to encourage people to boost their physical and mental health.  The Ministry of Tourism and the Embassy of India joined hands to organize the second edition of International Day of Yoga last year with events in Siem Reap, Sihanoukville and Phnom Penh.  Over 8,000 people are expected to take part in Yoga Day celebrations in Vietnam tomorrow. The third edition of the event in Việt Nam was kicked of in Hà Nội on June 16.  Singapore  The Straits Times in a report quoted a recent research on yoga saying it may not be as safe as it is made out to be. This is a concern that has worried many – with some trainers lacking expertise.  Yoga is one of the fastest-growing sports worldwide, but new research released last week suggests that it is not as safe as previously believed. A joint study, conducted by the University of Sydney in Australia and the Mercy College in New York, found that 10 per cent of people who practice yoga experience musculoskeletal pain, while 21 per cent experience further pain to existing injuries.  The study looked at injury rates for those who practize yoga.  However, this study in unlikely to create a dent in the popularity of yoga or dampen Yoga Day celebrations tomorrow.

"Depression could speed up brain aging, finds new analysis",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/295607/depression-speed-brain-aging-finds-new-analysis/,"07:20 PM May 27, 2018","A new UK review has found that those who have depression or anxiety could also show an increased rate of cognitive decline later in life. Carried out by psychologists at the University of Sussex, the review looked at 34 longitudinal studies involving a total of 71,244 participants and that focused on a link between depression or anxiety and a decline in cognitive function over time. The studies included participants who showed symptoms of depression as well as those who were diagnosed as clinically depressed, but none had a diagnosis of dementia at the start of the study. The team found that those with depression experienced a greater decline in cognitive function, including memory loss, executive function (such as decision making) and information-processing speed, in later older adulthood than those without depression. With 32 of the studies looking at depression, and 5 looking at anxiety, the researchers commented that the number of anxiety studies was insufficient for a meta-analysis. Previous research has already suggested that people with depression or anxiety have an increased risk of dementia in later life, however this is the first study to provide comprehensive evidence that depression can have an effect on decline in overall cognitive function. As there is no current cure for dementia, the findings could be important for identifying those who may be at a greater risk of developing dementia so that early interventions can be put into place. “This study is of great importance — our populations are aging at a rapid rate and the number of people living with decreasing cognitive abilities and dementia is expected to grow substantially over the next 30 years,” commented one of the lead authors of the study, Dr. Darya Gaysina. Amber John who also led the study added, “Depression is a common mental health problem — each year, at least 1 in 5 people in the UK experience symptoms. But people living with depression shouldn’t despair — it’s not inevitable that you will see a greater decline in cognitive abilities, and taking preventative measures such as exercising, practicing mindfulness and undertaking recommended therapeutic treatments, such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy, have all been shown to be helpful in supporting well-being, which in turn may help to protect cognitive health in older age.” Both are now calling for greater awareness of the importance of supporting mental health to protect brain health in later life. The results can be found published online in the journal Psychological Medicine.

Platt, wife of former US Ambassador to the Philippines  Nicholas Platt, passed away surrounded by her family on May 15 at home in New York City. Even after Ambassador Platt left the Philippines to take up his post as ambassador to Pakistan, eventually returning to New York in November 1992 after retiring from foreign service to become president of the Asia Society, Sheila Platt continued to return yearly to the Philippines to continue her work as board member of Community Family Service International (CFSI), a refugee mental health organization in the Philippines and Hong Kong, Save the Children, Philippines, and the American Chamber of Commerce Foundation in Manila. She devoted her time and energy to a remarkable range of causes. As a volunteer she worked with refugees in Hong Kong, with the Tokyo English Life Line (TELL) in Tokyo, with Youth for Understanding International Student Exchange in Washington, with the Mental Health Association, and the University Health Clinic of Zambia, and with various women’s organizations in the Philippines and Pakistan. She was also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Platt did psychiatric and medical social work in Washington, D.C., with the International Social Service of Japan in Tokyo, the In Touch Foundation in Manila, and international schools in Africa and Asia.
She provided consultant and training services to many volunteer organizations, as well as to the Department of State, the Peace Corps and the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. Platt’s special interests in refugees could have stemmed from her experience as a migrant herself, having moved with her diplomat husband and children from one foreign service post to another, in  Canada, Taiwan, China, Japan, Zambia, the Philippines and Pakistan, as well as in Washington, D.C. She was a life-long student of the problems as well as the resources of refugees and others, who willingly or unwillingly, find themselves moving within their own country or across national boundaries. Platt has lectured for CFSI at the City University of New York Diploma in Humanitarian Assistance course and at the Columbia University School of Journalism on “Occupational Stress Management for Journalists Covering Regional Conflicts.”
She represented CFSI at the UN-NGO Committee on Mental Health in New York and in other meetings. Platt attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass., completing her undergraduate work at Trinity College, Washington, with a BA in English Literature. She went on to Catholic University where she received her master’s degree in Social Work in 1973. A woman of great discernment, she was a professional, a volunteer, a mother, and a greatly valued member of the Asia Society family. She leaves a strong legacy in those bridges of understanding she built, and, of course, in her family. She was loved by many Filipino friends,  held in a cherished place as a person of inspiration, intelligence and great humanity. She was also the  cherished mother of Adam, a writer; Oliver, an actor; and Nicholas Jr., an investment banker; and grandmother to eight grandchildren. Sheila Platt was a native of New York City.

Tick tock: Study links body clock to mood disorders,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/294492/p2fb-tick-tock-study-links-body-clock-mood-disorders/,"07:46 PM May 16, 2018","Messing with the natural rhythm of one’s internal clock may boost the risk of developing mood problems ranging from garden-variety loneliness to severe depression and bipolar disorder, researchers said Wednesday. The largest study of its kind, involving more than 91,000 people, also linked interference with the body’s “circadian rhythm” to a decline in cognitive functions such as memory and attention span. The brain’s hard-wired circadian timekeeper governs day-night cycles, influencing sleep patterns, the release of hormones and even body temperature. Earlier research had suggested that disrupting these rhythms can adversely affect mental health, but was inconclusive: most data was self-reported, participant groups were small, and potentially data-skewing factors were not ruled out. For the new study, an international team led by University of Glasgow psychologist Laura Lyall analysed data — taken from the UK Biobank, one of the most complete long-term health surveys ever done — on 91,105 people aged 37 to 73. The volunteers wore accelerometers that measured patterns of rest and activity and had this record compared to their mental history, also taken from the UK Biobank. Individuals with a history of disrupting their body’s natural rhythm — working night shifts, for example, or suffering repeated jetlag — also tended to have a higher lifetime risk of mood disorders, feelings of unhappiness, and cognitive problems, the researchers found. ‘Owls’ and ‘Larks’ The results held true even when the potential impact of factors such as old age, unhealthy lifestyle, obesity, and childhood trauma were taken into account, they reported in The Lancet Psychiatry, a medical journal. The study cannot say conclusively that body clock disturbances are what caused the mental risk, instead of the other way round. But the findings “reinforce the idea that mood disorders are associated with disturbed circadian rhythms,” said Lyall. Measurements of people’s rest-work cycles could be a useful tool for flagging and treating people at risk of major depression or bipolar disorders, the researchers concluded. One limitation of the study was the average age of the trial participants: 62. “Seventy-five percent of [mental] disorders start before the age of 24 years,” said University of Oxford researcher Aiden Doherty, commenting on the paper. “The circadian system undergoes developmental changes during adolescence, which is also a common time for the onset of mood disorders,” he added. Humans have been shown to be either “owls” or “larks,” corresponding to so-called genetic “chronotypes” that determine whether we function better at night or during the day. Last year, the Nobel Prize for medicine was awarded to three United States scientists who pioneered our understanding of how the circadian clock ticks.

Higher risk of early death for men with physically strenuous jobs found by study,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/294436/higher-risk-early-death-men-physically-strenuous-jobs-found-study/,"05:27 PM May 16, 2018","A new study has found that men with highly physical jobs had an 18 percent higher risk of early death compared to those with jobs involving low levels of physical activity. The findings come from a meta-analysis published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. While regular physical activity is generally considered beneficial to health, having a highly physical job could, in fact, have detrimental health outcomes for men. No such association was observed among women. The findings are based on a meta-analysis of 17 studies pooling data from 193,696 participants from 1960 to 2010. The scientists found an 18 percent higher risk of early death in men with highly physical jobs compared to men with jobs involving low levels of physical activity. “High levels of occupational [physical activity] commonly reached by tasks involving manual handling, repetitive work and prolonged static postures, elevate heart rate and blood pressure and are performed over long periods of time (often ≥40 hours/week), with insufficient time for recovery,” the authors explain. As well as the risk of exhaustion and cardiovascular disease, the study also identifies socioeconomic status as a factor that could explain the higher risk of early death. Indeed, the study acknowledges that workers with physically active jobs are more often from lower socioeconomic classes, a factor itself associated with higher mortality. The authors suggest that leisure-time physical activities “are likely to differ in acute and chronic responses,” since they are likely to be of moderate intensity, shorter duration and with longer recovery times. As a result, the study concludes that physical activity guidelines may need to differentiate between physical activity in the workplace and physical activity during leisure time or for transportation. The study is published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

Women helping women,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/293715/women-helping-women/,"03:51 PM May 08, 2018","The Women’s Team Member Network (WTMN) of Wells Fargo Enterprise Global Services, LLC – Philippines celebrated Women’s Month in March with a very special honor: It had been named an official International Chapter, which grants equal status with all other chapters within Wells Fargo, all over the world. As an international chapter, WTMN Philippines belongs to a greater network, learning from the best practices of other chapters while sharing its own unique experiences. Many of those experiences involve women supporting women both inside and outside of Wells Fargo. As part of the celebrations, WTMN organized a talk for Wells Fargo team members featuring Jeannie Javelosa, founder of GREAT Women Philippines Corp. and co-founder of ECHOstore, a sustainable lifestyle store. Javelosa highlighted stories of women artisans in the GREAT Women and ECHOstore networks who lead and drive the livelihood of their local communities. GREAT stands for Gender Responsive Economic Actions for the Transformation of Women. Through this platform one can see the power of women helping women and the power of an eco-system that supports women. The WTMN also organized a donation drive to benefit the Marillac Center for Children and The Haven for Women – temporary shelters that provide rehabilitation and protective custody to young girls and women who have been victims of sexual crimes, domestic abuse, and the like. Wells Fargo EGS Philippines team members donated toiletries and hygiene products. Team members also conducted a Hands on Banking® Philippines financial literacy training program with the women and staff of The Haven. Hands on Banking is a volunteer program in which Wells Fargo EGS Philippines team members share their knowledge in local communities to provide education on financial management and success. Helen Molina, a social worker of the Department of Social Welfare and Development and house parent at The Haven said, “At the Center, these women have help. They don’t need to think about bills. When they leave the Center, they will be responsible for everything. Aside from charitable donations, through these volunteer efforts of Wells Fargo EGS Philippines team members, the women learn the value of money and how to be financially stable. They can apply these lessons once they’ve gotten back on their feet.” Also during Women’s Month, Wells Fargo EGS Philippines organized a talk to address a growing concern in a beneficiary school: the online sexual exploitation of children, and violence against women and children. They brought in experts to discuss the mental health impacts of the trauma experienced by children in such cases. “As we work to strengthen our internal awareness campaigns to help prevent and end violence against women and children, helping those who have been in that same situation makes our internal campaigns more meaningful,” said Nicole Tirona, Wells Fargo EGS Philippines Community Affairs manager. “WTMN volunteers also learn much from the brave women and young girls who are working hard in rebuilding their lives after going through periods of varied abuse.” ADVT  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
"Evening exposure to blue light from screens linked to higher risk of breast, prostate cancer",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/293071/p2fb-evening-exposure-to-blue-light-from-screens-linked-to-higher-risk-of-breast-prostate-cancer/,"07:47 PM April 30, 2018","New European research has found a link between night-time exposure to blue light, a range of the visible light spectrum emitted from smartphones and tablets, and an increased risk of developing breast and prostate cancer. Carried out by an international team led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), the researchers looked at data from more than 4,000 people between 20 and 85 years of age in 11 Spanish regions, both with and without breast and prostate cancer. The team assessed the participants’ indoor exposure to artificial light using questionnaires, and evaluated outdoor levels of artificial light for Madrid and Barcelona, based on nocturnal images taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station. The results for the two cities showed that those who were exposed to higher levels of blue light had a 1.5-fold and two-fold higher risk of developing breast and prostate cancer, respectively, when compared to those who were less exposed. Manolis Kogevinas, coordinator of the study, commented, “WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified night shift work as probably carcinogenic to humans. There is evidence pointing to an association between exposure to artificial light at night, disruption of the circadian rhythm, and breast and prostate cancers. With this study, we sought to determine whether night exposure to light in cities can affect the development of these two types of cancer.” “Given the ubiquity of artificial light at night, determining whether it increases or not the risk of cancer is a public health issue,” added Ariadna García-Saenz, first author of the study. “At this point, further studies should include more individual data using for instance light sensors that allow measuring indoor light levels. It would also be important to do this kind of research in young people that extensively use blue light emitting screens.” Recent research has mainly focused on looking at the effect of blue light on sleep. Many studies have found that our increased use of devices such as smartphones and tablets could be to blame for the current global sleep epidemic, as the blue light emitted from screens suppresses production of the hormone melatonin, which we need to fall asleep. Many experts now advise avoiding bright light and blue light from computer and phone screens for at least two hours before heading to bed. The results were published online in Environmental Health Perspectives.

5 tips on how to do a ‘spring detox’ from your smartphone,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/292468/p2fb-spring-detox-smartphone/,"06:16 PM April 23, 2018","If you’re thinking about a spring detox to give your health a boost, don’t forget your mental health. Many studies have shown how an increasing use of smartphones and social media can distract us from family, friends and work, amplify feelings of anxiety and depression, and make us unhappier. If you want to reduce your smartphone use, read on for five expert tips to help you take a break from your phone and avoid addiction. 1. Schedule your time to avoid smartphone addiction “Now we can do so much online, a lot of our daily lives are on our phone,” said Steven Sussman, professor of preventive medicine, psychology and social work at University of Southern California, who recognizes that this can make it hard to avoid using your device. However, there are ways to limit use, with Sussman suggesting setting a schedule with times for when you are allowed to use certain websites or apps, or limiting how many times you check your phone to once every 15 minutes, then once every 30 minutes, and so on. 2. Turn off notifications San Francisco State University Professor of Health Education Erik Peper says that digital addiction is not our fault, but a result of the tech industry’s desire to increase profits. Push notifications, vibrations and other alerts on our phones compel us to look at them by triggering the same neural pathways in our brains that once alerted us to imminent danger, such as an attack by a tiger or other large predator. “But now we are hijacked by those same mechanisms that once protected us and allowed us to survive, for the most trivial pieces of information,” he adds. Peper suggests turning off push notifications so you can focus on daily tasks rather than being constantly interrupted by your phone, and to avoid triggering these neural pathways. 3. Don’t use your phone at mealtimes This is one way to easily and quickly cut down your phone use, and it comes with other benefits according to Julie Albright, a psychology lecturer at USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “Keeping them out of sight during family dinners lets you focus on the people around you and be present,” she said. Sierra Hinkle, a Holistic Health minor and student of Peper has another trick to avoid phones when eating: when out with friends, they all put their phones in the center of the table, and the first one to touch theirs buys the drinks. “We have to become creative and approach technology in a different way that still incorporates the skills we need but doesn’t take away from real-life experience,” said Hinkle. 4. Quit social media Khari McKendell, also a student of Peper, has tried to reduce phone use by closing his social media accounts. “I still call and text people but I want to make sure that a majority of the time I’m talking to my friends in person,” he said. The fewer social media accounts you have the less likely you are to be constantly on your phone, and, according to various studies, the more likely you are to feel happier. 5. Charge your phone in another room If you’re really struggling to limit phone use during the day, perhaps because you simply need it to check work emails or urgent messages, Albright suggests a small way to disconnect from your phone, by charging it in another room in the evening. “This is a way to reconnect with body, mind, and self and not be in constant state of overstimulation of the mind,” Albright said. “We all need that quiet time to be able to think again and refocus.” JB RELATED STORIES: Posting too many selfies (selfitis) a mental disorder?

Could meditation boost brain functioning long-term?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/291194/p2fb-meditation-boost-brain-functioning-long-term/,"04:17 PM April 09, 2018","A new study looking at the long-term effects of meditation has found that those who follow the practice can benefit from improvements in their attention for up to seven years. Led by researchers at the University of California, Davis, Center for Mind and Brain, the study is based on the Shamatha Project, the most comprehensive longitudinal study of intensive meditation to be carried out so far. The project followed 60 experienced meditators who attended an intensive three-month meditation retreat, attending group meditation sessions twice a day and practicing individually for about six hours a day. The researchers found that immediately after the study, all participants showed improvements in their attention, general well-being and ability to cope with stress. During the most recent follow-up, held seven years after the retreat, the researchers also found that the 40 attendees who had continued to participate in the study and meditate for around one hour a day still showed improvements in their attention. This effect was particularly pronounced in the older participants, who had maintained a stricter practice over the seven years and did not show typical patterns of decline in attention usually associated with aging. However, first author Anthony Zanesco did note that the benefits appeared to plateau after the retreat, even in those who meditated the most, suggesting that there may be limits to how much meditation can influence cognition. As with the current study, most research looking at health benefits of meditation has tended to only include small sample sizes, and until now focused more on the short-term effects. However, the body of evidence that meditation has benefits both our physical and mental health is growing. One of the biggest benefits appears to be a reduction in stress levels. A 2016 study found that 35 stressed out adults benefited more from meditation than they did from relaxation techniques, while a study published last year found that just ten minutes a day of meditation could help reduce anxiety. Meditation could also be used as a tool to tackle obesity, with teenagers who were taught meditation techniques as part of a 2016 study showing improvements in both diet and exercise months later. It could even be effective in reducing some cases of physical pain; with a study looking at 342 adults suffering from lower back pain finding that those treated with meditation-based stress reduction and yoga showed larger improvements than those treated with conventional pain medication. Even the American Heart Association has voiced its support for meditation, as long as it is used to complement and not replace a heart-healthy diet and exercise regime. A review of 57 current studies published by the association last year reported that meditation may be associated with decreased levels of stress, anxiety and depression, and improved quality of sleep and overall well-being. It also raised the idea that the practice may be linked with decreased risk of heart attack, although with only a few studies on this, more research is needed before conclusions can be made. The current research was published in the Journal of Cognitive Enhancement. JB RELATED STORIES: Could exercising make you happier?

Could exercising make you happier?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/291155/exercising-make-happier-p2fb/,"07:05 PM April 08, 2018","New United States research suggests that if you want to be happier, try exercising, with a review of studies from around the world finding that physical activity can boost levels of contentment in all ages. Although many previous studies have found that physical activity can be beneficial for mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, working as both prevention and treatment, less is known about how it can affect positive mental health conditions, such as contentment. To research further, Weiyun Chen and co-author Zhanjia Zhang, both at the University of Michigan, reviewed 23 studies on happiness and physical activity. The studies included data from thousands of participants in several different countries and included a variety of ages and populations including adults, seniors, adolescents, children and cancer survivors. Although the eight interventional studies included in the research showed inconsistent results, the 15 observational studies all showed a positive direct or indirect association between happiness and exercise, with the team finding that one day of exercise per week may be enough to boost happiness in some cases. The researchers found that those who were classed as insufficiently active were still 20 percent more likely to be happy than those who did no exercise at all, with this number increasing to 29 percent for the sufficiently active, and 52 percent for those who were very active. However, for those concerned that they can’t reach “very active” levels, the researchers also found that there did appear to be a threshold for the relationship between happiness and physical activity, with several studies showing that happiness levels were the same whether people exercised 150 to 300 minutes a week or more than 300 minutes a week. When looking at the effect of exercise in different age groups, the results also showed that physical activity appeared to have a positive effect on happiness levels of both young and old, and when the team assessed the effect of exercise in specific populations, they found that physical activity could also improve the happiness of ovarian cancer survivors, children and adolescents with cerebral palsy and drug abusers. Some of the types of exercise observed to have a positive effect on different populations included aerobic exercise, mixed school activity classes for children, and stretching and balance exercises. However, the team added that future research is needed to help determine how physical activity influences happiness, and which type and what dosage of physical activity is best for boosting happiness. The results can be found publishing online in the Journal of Happiness Studies. JB  RELATED STORIES: Are nut and seed proteins good for heart health?

"Attending concerts helps you live longer, new study finds",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/290350/attending-concerts-helps-live-longer-new-study-finds/,"01:04 PM March 30, 2018","Are you the type of person who loves going out to gigs or see their favorite artists live when they visit your area?This new research might benefit you. According to a new research released Wednesday, attending to gigs and concerts for live music for at least 20 minutes can increase your feeling of well-being by 21 percent. This was conducted by London’s Goldsmith University Associate Lecturer Patrick Fagan with a joint partnership with music and entertainment venue O2. In addition, another scholarly research saw a direct link in high levels of well-being, meaning a lifespan increase of nine years, with gig-going and longevity. Concert-goers who attend gigs once every two weeks or more were the most likely to score happiness, contentment, self-esteem and productivity at the highest rate (a score of perfect 10), accompanying research showed. The test subjects who participated went through bespoke psychometric and heart-rate tests while doing various activities — yoga, dog walking and gig-going. Attending concerts showed the highest in well-being, compared with yoga with only 10 percent and dog walking with 7 percent. Aside from an increase in well-being, those who went to gigs showed feelings of self-worth by 25 percent, being close to others by another 25 percent. Mental stimulation showed the highest number with 75 percent. “Our research showcases the profound impact gigs have on feelings of health, happiness and well-being–with fortnightly or regular attendance being the key,” Fagan said. “Combining all of our findings with O2’s research, we arrive at a prescription of a gig a fortnight which could pave the way for almost a decade more years of life.”  /ra  RELATED STORIES: Listening to too much Christmas songs may damage mental health, says expert Stories behind the songs    CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
"Bad sleeping habits can start in childhood, finds new study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/289932/p2fb-bad-sleep-habits-can-start-childhood-finds-new-study/,"05:32 PM March 25, 2018","Children as young as eight may already show unhealthy sleeping habits normally associated with adolescence, according to new research, which could be affecting their school performance and health. Carried out by researchers at McGill University, Canada, the new study looked at the sleep patterns of 144 children aged six to 11 years old during the academic year. Participants were divided into three age groups: 6 to 7 years; 8 to 9 years; and 10 to 11 years, with each participant’s sleep pattern assessed over seven nights using a miniature actigraph, a wristwatch-like device that measures movement to evaluate sleep. The recordings showed that the older the children were, the greater and more significant the delay in sleep start time and the shorter their sleep duration. Only 17 percent of children aged 6 to 7 got the recommended amount of sleep, with this figure dropping to just 2.5 percent for those aged 10 to 11. In addition, the team found that those aged 8 to 11 increasingly showed unhealthy sleep patterns usually found in teenagers, such as later bedtimes, inconsistent sleep schedules, and sleep deprivation. Poor sleep patterns have previously been shown to impair academic performance at school, as well as children’s physical and mental health. “Our findings contradict the prevailing assumption that sleep patterns remain largely unchanged during the school-age period, from six to 13 years old,” says Reut Gruber, an associate professor in McGill’s Department of Psychiatry and lead author of the study, adding that the findings “highlight the importance of boundaries related to bedtime that parents should consider setting for their children even as they get older and more independent.” These boundaries include setting a regular time for bed, a regular time to wake up, teaching children the importance of sleep for school and health, and encouraging children to get sufficient amount of good quality sleep, as well as seeking help if they are having sleep problems. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children 6 to 12 years of age should sleep 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis for optimal health. Teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should aim to get 8 to 10 hours sleep. The findings are to be published in the journal Sleep Medicine.

Soy-based formulas could cause subtle changes in babies’ reproductive system tissues,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/288948/soy-based-formulas-cause-subtle-changes-babies-reproductive-system-tissues/,"09:01 PM March 14, 2018","New United States research has found that infants who are fed soy-based formulas as newborns show differences in some reproductive-system cells and tissues, possibly due to exposure to estrogen-like compounds found in this type of milk. Funded and led by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of the National Institutes of Health, the research looked at the effect of different milks on postnatal development of estrogen-responsive tissues and hormone levels in male and female infants. The study was completed by 283 infant-mother pairs completed the study, with 102 of the infants exclusively fed on soy formula; 111 infants were exclusively fed on on cow-milk formula, and 70 on breast milk. The researchers repeatedly measured the boys up to 28 weeks and the girls up to 36, looking at the maturational index (MI) based on epithelial cells from the children’s urogenital tissue; ultrasound measurements of uterine, ovarian and testicular volume as well as breast-buds; and hormone concentrations using blood tests. The results showed that the main differences found related to the girls, with the team discovering that compared to those who were fed cow-milk formula, girls fed soy formula showed developmental changes consistent with those found in response to estrogen exposure. The team also found that vaginal cell MI was higher and uterine volume decreased more slowly in girls who fed soy formula. However, no significant differences were found between boys fed cow-milk formula and those fed soy formula. “Soy formula contains high concentrations of plant-based estrogen-like compounds, and because this formula is the sole food source for many babies in the first six months of life, it’s important to understand the effects of exposure to such compounds during a critical period in development,” explained Virginia A. Stallings, MD, senior author of the study. Soy formula has long been used among women who don’t breastfeed as an alternative to cow-milk formula, often by mothers concerned about milk allergies or lactose intolerance. However, soy protein contains high amounts of genistein, an estrogen-like compound which can alter the body’s endocrine system and potentially interfere with normal hormonal development, although little is known about its effects on infants. The researchers did point out that the differences were subtle and not a cause for alarm, but they do suggest the need for further research to investigate possible long-term effects of exposure to soy-based formula. “Modern soy formula has been used safely for decades. However, our observational study found subtle effects in estrogen-responsive tissues in soy-fed infants, and we don’t know if these differences are associated with long-term health effects,” said first author Margaret A. Adgent. Stallings added that in the meantime, “For new and expectant mothers deciding on how to feed their infants, as always, we strongly support breastfeeding, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.” The AAP does not recommend soy formula for preterm infants, but it is suggested for infants with hereditary disorders that make them unable to properly digest milk, such as galactosemia, and “in situations in which a vegetarian diet is preferred.” The findings can be found published online in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.

"More weight around waist could increase risk of anxiety in women, says study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/288717/more-weight-around-waist-could-increase-risk-of-anxiety-in-women-says-study/,"08:50 PM March 12, 2018","New research has found that excess weight around the waistline could be linked to mental as well as physical health problems, finding that women who had a higher waist-to-higher ratio may also have an increased risk of developing anxiety. Carried out by researchers from the Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC) and Universidad Nacional de Piura (UNP), Perú, the Universidad de Chile, Chile and the Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil, Ecuador, the study looked at 5,580 women between 40 and 59 years of age from 11 Latin America countries. The researchers measured anxiety levels of the women as well as their waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), in the first study to look at a link between the condition and this specific measurement of weight. Waist-to-height ratio has previously been shown to be the best indicator for assessing risk of developing a cardiometabolic disease, which includes cardiovascular disease (stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction), diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. A general guideline is that a woman is considered obese if her waist measures more than half of her height. With 61.3 percent of the participants reporting experiencing anxiety, the team found that women in the middle and upper thirds of waist-to-height ratios were significantly more likely to have the condition. In addition, those in the upper third were also more likely to actually display signs of anxiety, compared with women in the lower two-thirds. Anxiety is one of the most common mental health disorders. It can be caused by a variety of factors, but women are more likely to experience anxiety than men. Research has also shown that the rate of anxiety among women can increase during middle age, possibly due to levels of estrogen decreasing, which can have a protective effect. The findings could also be significant as anxiety is linked to a variety of other serious conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, respiratory disorders and drug abuse. “Hormone changes may be involved in the development of both anxiety and abdominal obesity because of their roles in the brain as well as in fat distribution. This study provides valuable insights for healthcare providers treating middle-aged women, because it implies that waist-to-height ratio could be a good marker for evaluating patients for anxiety,” says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, executive director of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS). The findings can be found published online in Menopause, the journal of NAMS. JB RELATED STORIES: Could a lifetime of exercise be the key to slowing down the aging process?

"No link between the pill and depression, says new study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/287708/p2fb-no-link-pill-depression-says-new-study/,"12:52 PM March 01, 2018","New research has found that despite some women’s concerns, there is no link between hormonal birth control and depression. Carried out by researchers at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in the United States, the team reviewed thousands of studies on the mental health effects of contraceptives, which included data on various birth control methods including injections, implants and pills. They also looked at studies which specifically looked at the effects of hormonal birth control on postpartum women, adolescents and women with a history of depression. However, in all cases the researchers came to the same conclusion: there is insufficient evidence to prove a link between birth control and depression. “Depression is a concern for a lot of women when they’re starting hormonal contraception, particularly when they’re using specific types that have progesterone,” said Dr. Brett Worly, lead author of the study and OB-GYN at Ohio State Wexner Medical Center. “Based on our findings, this side effect shouldn’t be a concern for most women, and they should feel comfortable knowing they’re making a safe choice.” Worly noted that teens and pregnant mothers sometimes have a higher risk of depression, however he added that this risk is already there and is not linked to their contraception. “For those patients, it’s important that they have a good relationship with their healthcare provider so they can get the appropriate screening done, regardless of the medications they’re on,” advises Worly. Worly stressed that if other patients are also worried about the potential side effects of the pill these concerns are also valid, and he encourages all women to have open conversations with their doctor to find the contraceptive option that is right for them. “We live in a media-savvy age where if one or a few people have severe side effects, all of a sudden, that gets amplified to every single person,” he said. “The biggest misconception is that birth control leads to depression. For most patients that’s just not the case.” Nearly 37 million women in the U.S. are currently using birth control. Sixty-seven percent of current users have chosen a non-permanent hormonal method such as an oral pill, however 30 percent have discontinued their use due to dissatisfaction with potential side effects.

Led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), in collaboration with the Hospital del Mar (Spain) and the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health (UCLA FSPH), the study looked at 253 schoolchildren taking part in the BREATHE project in Barcelona. The team estimated the children’s exposure to greenspace in their neighbourhood from birth up through to the time of the study, and assessed brain anatomy using high-resolution 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI). Working memory and inattentiveness were measured with computerized tests. The results showed that long-term exposure to greenspace was positively associated with volumes of white and gray matter volume in certain areas of the brain, which partly overlap with the areas associated with higher scores on cognitive tests. In addition, high volumes of white and gray matter in the areas of the brain associated with greenspace exposure also predicted better working memory and reduced inattentiveness. “This is the first study that evaluates the association between long-term exposure to greenspace and brain structure,” says Dr. Payam Dadvand, ISGlobal researcher and leading author of the study. “Our findings suggest that exposure to greenspace early in life could result in beneficial structural changes in the brain.” The results back up findings from a previous study which also looked at children taking part in the BREATHE project, and showed that those who attended schools with more outdoor greenspace had a greater increase in working memory and a greater reduction in inattentiveness than children who attended schools with less greenspace nearby. Previous research has also shown that exposure to greenspace and time in nature could also potentially improve academic performance, and reduce stress and aggressive behavior. Greenspaces are believed to have a beneficial effect on brain development as they provide children with opportunities for discovery, creativity and risk taking, as well as psychological restoration. They also often have lower levels of pollution and noise and encourage physical activity, all of which can have a positive effect on brain development.

The word refers to both the perpetrator and the act itself. Japanese woman Kumi Sasaki, now based in France, has published a book entitled “Tchikan” recounting the sexual assault she experienced during her teenage years, reports SoraNews24.

Kumi Sasaki en témoigne dans Tchikan #BalanceTonPorc #harcelement pic.twitter.com/4VFWrixVyx — Thierry Marchaisse (@EditionsTM) October 17, 2017  Sasaki, now in her 30s, says she aims to highlight the negative effects of sexual misconduct on girls and women. Her encounters are listed in vivid detail, beginning when she was 12 on Tokyo’s Yamanote Line. “The fingers of his unfamiliar hand went inside the collar of my blouse. Then he touched my back, he touched my legs, my waist, even my butt. He placed his hand directly under the cheeks, quietly raising up my skirt by just moving his fingers, and he touched my left thigh under my skirt,” she says of the first incident. Since then, she would try to change what she wore, such as switching to jeans instead of skirts, or riding the bus to school just to avoid being molested. But the assault continued, from men of all ages, whether in their late teens or senior years. Sasaki also relates an incident wherein a middle-aged man not only molested but also stalked her home, telling her to bear his children. The near-daily incidents affected her mental health to the point of a suicide attempt—only avoided with the help of a friend. Sasaki has lived abroad and still carries a mistrust for men and trains. The book was released in November 2017 and is currently only available in French.  Niña V.

"Sitting for long periods increases levels of fat around internal organs, says new study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/284133/sitting-for-long-periods-increases-levels-of-fat-around-internal-organs-says-new-study/,"09:35 PM January 11, 2018","New research has found yet more evidence to suggest that sitting for prolonged periods of time is bad for your health, revealing an association between too much sedentary time and the amount of fat surrounding the internal organs. Carried out by a team of researchers from the NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre (a partnership between Leicester’s Hospitals, the University of Leicester and Loughborough University), the study looked at 124 participants at high risk of type 2 diabetes and measured the amount of time they spent sedentary, defined as any sitting/reclining activity with low energy expenditure. Participants were asked to wear an accelerometer fitted to their waist over a seven-day period to measure the amount of time they spent sedentary, with the team measuring the amount of fat in the liver, the inner (visceral) and outer (subcutaneous) fat layers, and total abdominal fat using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment. The team found that even after taking into account factors such as age, ethnicity and physical activity levels, the longer a person spent sitting during the day, the higher the levels of liver fat, inner (visceral) fat and total abdominal fat. The link between sitting time and levels of fat was even stronger for those who did not meet Public Health England’s recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week, suggesting that taking part in a sufficient amount of exercise each week could offer at least some protection against the harmful effects of too much sitting. Commenting on the findings, lead researcher Dr. Joe Henson said, “We know that spending long periods of time sedentary is unhealthy and a risk factor for chronic illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Likewise, the amount of fat deposited around our internal organs may also predispose us to these diseases.” Previous research has also suggested that too much sedentary time can lead to an increased risk of blood clots, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and even faster biological aging. Some studies have suggested that regular exercise can counteract the negative effects of prolonged sedentary, however the findings have so far been mixed. A 2015 study suggested that aiming to decrease the amount of sitting time rather than increasing the amount of exercise is the priority for staying healthy, while another study published the same year also stressed that we should aim to decrease sedentary time, finding that even those who partake in regular exercise are still at risk of the adverse health effects of prolonged sitting. The findings can be found published online in the journal Obesity.

Getting a flu shot every year could help prevent severe cases in older adults,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/283992/getting-a-flu-shot-every-year-could-help-prevent-severe-cases-in-older-adults/,"09:05 PM January 09, 2018","Getting a flu vaccine every year could reduce the severity of the virus in older adults, aged 65 and over, as well as reducing hospital admissions, according to new research published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. A team of Spanish researchers studied the effect of repeated influenza vaccination in a sample of people aged 65 and over admitted to 20 Spanish hospitals during the winters of 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015. The scientists enrolled 130 inpatients with severe influenza and 598 with non-severe influenza who were matched to 333 and 1,493 controls, respectively. Compared to those who were not vaccinated during the current and three previous winter seasons, effectiveness of the flu shot in the current and any previous season was 31 percent in preventing hospital admission for non-severe influenza, 74 percent in preventing intensive care admissions and 70 percent in preventing death. The researchers found that repeated flu vaccination was twice as effective in preventing severe influenza in people admitted to hospital for the virus, compared with non-severe cases, and that this effect was consistent regardless of flu season, virus subtype or patient age. The study also found that vaccination in the current season only had no significant effect on severe cases of influenza. Prevention of serious and deadly infections caused by the virus was seen mainly in patients who were vaccinated during the current season and in previous seasons, which, the authors conclude, adds weight to recommendations for older adults to get the flu shot every year.

The candidates were welcomed at the City Hall by Mayor Fernando Gonzalez and other local officials ahead of the long gown and swimwear competition on the M Plaza grounds in Batang village on Monday evening. At a press conference, the candidates vowed to protect the environment through their respective advocacies in addressing climate change and other pressing environmental issues. The ladies also urged the public to protect nature by planting trees and practicing proper waste disposal. “We are happy we were able to hold this event because the environment is very important to the people of Ligao. We take seriously the issues of the environment and its ecological balances,” Gonzalez said. He added: “In fact, we have programs and projects to preserve good air quality and clean water in pursuit of a healthy environment, and Miss Earth will surely advocate in this regard.” After the two-day event in the city, the mayor said he expects that the public’s consciousness of preserving and protecting the environment would increase. He also hoped that the pageant would help highlight the need to work together with government agencies concerning climate change “that is vital for the survival of the people on this planet.” After the presscon, the delegates held a motorcade through the major streets in the city.

"‘I’d like to, but my children won’t let me’",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/431933/id-like-to-but-my-children-wont-let-me/,"04:34 PM November 19, 2022","W hen I see the very elderly all dressed up being brought, with a lot of trouble, to restaurants by family, I wonder whether lolo or lola would have preferred to eat at home in comfort, comfort clothes included. No doubt, at a certain age, seniors are also safer at home than anywhere else. But does anybody bother to ask them what their pleasure might be? I’m afraid there’ll come a time when our opinions won’t matter, when everyone else will know what’s best for us and might even be right. But while we’re not there yet, perhaps we should make things perfectly clear. How often have I heard a fellow senior say, “I’d like to, but my children won’t let me go out?” For a time children were paranoid about the threat of COVID to their parents and other family elders, and I don’t blame them for becoming very strict with them. But the threat has greatly eased and the vaccines are apparently working—although I myself succumbed twice, but recovered sans hospitalization. I also think we sometimes give our children cause to suspect we may be losing it and prompt them to step up and take control. Occasional mental lapses, in many cases I know brought actually by hearing problems and a generational difficulty mastering electronic gadgets are among the usual signals. It’s a blessing I’ve got myself a healthy younger husband. Otherwise, I must admit sometimes, I could myself be giving my own children the wrong impressions. Well, definitely, I don’t have problems about control—not just yet. A widowed friend just announced to friends she was buying herself a new car, and we were excited for her. Alas, her children, now her cosignatories, wouldn’t let her. Another is being pressured, however gently, about the practicality of moving out of their now-oversized family home into a smaller house or a condo. Both happen to be in perfect control, not ready to cede it. But soon enough we may be persuaded to do that. At that point, my own dad had to let go. Many of my widowed friends, in fact, have done so, and seem happy they did. Some contemporaries I know didn’t even have to be stopped; they themselves didn’t want to go anywhere anymore, and feel, ironically, liberated. But they are mostly in their 90s and have become too dependent for acquainting themselves with the new technology, a territory where grandchildren prove handy.A few friends phone me for chats about the old times, about the people they miss or sometimes to remark upon a column of mine that has resonated with them. I’ve started Vibering older friends my columns, since I’m published less on paper now than online, which is unfamiliar, if not unknown, territory to most of them. These are my readers who precisely like being home more than anywhere else. My own lola, who lived to 92, hardly ever went out even when she was younger. She was likely in the kitchen, in her garden or sewing. I had my own taste of staying home like never before during the pandemic. I even experienced being in isolation during my two bouts of COVID, but I was too weak to care. Nowadays, outside of my aqua aerobics and gym work for rehab after an angioplasty, I also spend more time at home than anywhere else. I enjoy watching Netflix or YouTube, which my son Rob sets up for me. After my upcoming cataract operation, I’ll resume reading. I’m more often in the kitchen, mostly for special dishes and final tastings; otherwise, it’s kasambahay Lanie’s domain. With prices of food constantly going up, I’m back to planning home meals and looking for new recipes. Hazards surround every adventure now, whether in or out of the house, but I’m far from retiring from active life or surrendering control to anyone except for new technology. Anyway, I lead an uncomplicated life, with small resources to preside over. For fun? Vergel has his regular tennis. But he remains in fair demand mentoring younger journalists, and his opinion as an elder is often asked on a range of subjects in public forums. I myself have a lot of reunions with classmates from two schools—Maryknoll, for grade school, and St. Theresa’s, for high-school and college—not to mention with other groups of friends. One of them suggested no more air travel, so college buddies and I are going to Pampanga to visit a classmate who lives in a heritage home and whose husband collects vintage cars. I already missed two such excursions, being away. Winner Foundation, another group of friends, is having a Christmas fund-raising bazaar. It’s one of those yearly things we do, and I look forward to it. My writers’ group is planning a reunion of sorts in the home of our mentor, the late Gilda Cordero-Fernando, in Quezon City, before the end of the month. That’s always fun. We have a breakfast group meeting fairly regularly on topics that are always stimulating. My RATS—a gang of first cousins and a friend who is herself already family—are planning a trip to Bacolod to stay in the newly remodeled old home that belongs to cousin Sylvia, one of us. Life has to be made exciting and happy in the company of family and friends. But no matter how much we enjoy our outings, we’re always happy to be back home. No place like it to recover from everything—including fun. INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Should we treat high BP in elderly and those with end-stage disease?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/430969/should-we-treat-high-bp-in-elderly-and-those-with-end-stage-disease/,"06:23 PM November 01, 2022","I had the honor and pleasure of chairing an interesting debate during the recent International Society of Hypertension biennial scientific congress in Kyoto, Japan. The debate question was: Should we discontinue treatment for high blood pressure (BP) in frail patients (especially the elderly) and those in the end-stage of life? This is a frequent dilemma encountered by those treating such patients because there is not much data to guide physicians. These types of patients—the super elderly (more than 85 years old), frail patients and those with end-stage disease like cancer—are excluded from practically all randomized clinical trials, which serve as the basis for our treatment guidelines. There is also an emerging hypothesis termed “reverse epidemiology or causality” which suggests an apparent different, actually paradoxical relationship between numerous risk factors and outcomes in such types of patients. For example, in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing dialysis, they’re apparently better off if they’re overweight, have a slightly elevated BP, high cholesterol and elevated blood creatinine levels. Similar relationship of these conventional risk factors has been observed in those with longstanding heart failure, cancer and frail individuals. In the general population, obesity, high BP and cholesterol levels are considered risk factors, which all need to be reduced and controlled to levels recommended in the guidelines. We need to clarify that we’re not including in this category of frail patients and those with end-stage disease, seniors more than 60 years of age, including those in their 80s who are still physically strong and able. A 90-year old individual who can still carry out ordinary physical activities without symptoms should be treated differently compared to a 55 year old with end-stage cancer, or a 60-year-old patient with longstanding heart failure who is short of breath even with just minimal physical activities. Physicians use several types of frailty indices or assessment methods to determine if an individual is considered frail or not.Advancing age alone is not the only parameter for frailty. The multifactorial frailty indices strongly predict long-term outcomes including death, disability and mental decline and they have been shown to be more accurately predictive than simple chronological age. So, going back to the clinical dilemma—should we still be aggressive in treating high BP in frail individuals and those with end-stage disease? There is no clear answer yet to the question due to the paucity of data, but it was the consensus that we should not strictly follow the guidelines when treating such patients. The decision whether to treat or not should be individualized depending on the physician’s assessment of the overall condition of the patient. In our clinical practice, we generally don’t treat mild elevation of BP up to around 155 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), especially if the BP drops excessively from a recumbent or lying position to a sitting and standing positions. This is called postural hypotension, which medicines for high BP could aggravate and could be the reason for fainting or loss of consciousness (syncope) when they stand up. Many accidents happen such that the loss of consciousness can cause them to hit their heads and develop bleeding in the brain, or fractures. So, in the elderly and frail individuals, it’s important to check the BP in sitting and standing positions. Aside from the risk of postural hypotension and resulting complications (syncope, intracranial hemorrhage, fractures), why should we not be very aggressive in lowering BP in the elderly and frail individuals? Published studies have shown that older individuals have a progressive reduction of their BP over time. The diastolic BP (the denominator in the BP) is first to go down, which has been observed to start from 55 years of age and older, such that some elderly may have a BP of 180/60 mmHg. The systolic BP (numerator) remains high but the diastolic BP gets lower. This is called isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) which is common in the elderly. As one gets older, particularly in seniors 80 years old and older with increasing frailty, a decline in BP over time is fairly common and what may still be considered normal BP in younger individuals may be associated with increased risk of strokes, heart attacks and deaths in these individuals. Hence, the reverse causality hypothesis suggests that a decreasing BP may be considered a marker of declining health status, whereas a higher BP may conversely considered a marker of better health condition. This is a paradox of sorts but such has been repeatedly observed in published data. The explanation given for this phenomenon is that the arteries become stiffer with increasing age, and in the presence of arterial stiffness, a drop in the BP when under treatment may further decrease an already low diastolic BP, which in turn leads to lower perfusion of the heart arteries. This causes ischemia (lack of oxygen) in the heart tissues, which may lead to heart attacks and life-threatening irregularity of heartbeat (arrhythmia). In more advanced medical centers, the degree of arterial stiffness can be measured with tests determining functional arterial characteristics (pulse wave velocity, flow-mediated dilatation and other tests for endothelial function). But even without these tests, we can have a fair assessment of arterial stiffness through the blood pressure. If there is an increased difference or gap in the systolic and diastolic BPs, there is likely arterial stiffness. This difference is called the pulse pressure (PP). In one with a normal BP, say 120/80 mmHg, the PP is in the range of 30 to 50 mmHg. If the PP exceeds 50 and there is ISH (systolic BP more than 140 mmHg), then we suspect arterial stiffness already. The higher the PP, say in one with a BP of 180/70 mmHg (PP equals 110 mmHg), we can safely assume that the arterial stiffness is worse. How do we treat such patients then? This is where the assessment by the physician of the overall frailty index comes in. The guidelines are also not too clear on this, but the prevailing consensus is that we should try to bring down the BP to less than 160 mmHg, but not less than 150 mmHg in extremely frail individuals. In our practice, we note the response of the PP while on treatment. It should be reduced as well. But if the diastolic BP is already less than 60 mmHg despite an elevated systolic BP (more than 140 mmHg), we may have to stop increasing the dose of the BP meds. Another important advice we give patients is to monitor their BP at home. Office BP determination may sometimes be misleading. There’s what is called as “white-coat” hypertension—falsely high BP when in the doctor’s clinic, and there is also “masked” hypertension—normal BP in the clinic but with labile BP at other times of the day. With home BP, taken at different times of the day, we can have a fairly good assessment of the patient’s BP problem—especially the BP variability or lability—without having to request for a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. So, it cannot be overemphasized that treatment of high BP in the frail elderly and those with end-stage disease has to be individualized. A comprehensive assessment by the physician of the individual’s frailty index and long-term outlook (in those with end-stage disease), cautious titration of antihypertensive meds and home BP monitoring are important parameters that can guide one’s decision to treat or not treat, and what type and dose of BP-lowering drugs should be given.

After school activities your kids can enjoy—No matter the season,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/431000/after-school-activities-your-kids-can-enjoy-no-matter-the-season/,"02:20 PM October 28, 2022"," “Cleanliness is next to godliness.” Chances are we’ve all heard this idiom, at some point in our  lives. Chances are, as well, that as parents, we tend to bring this adage into the way we raise  our children. No doubt there’s a degree of wisdom to it. But Breeze is here to remind us that  getting dirty is not always a bad thing. In fact, getting dirty can be a sign that your child has  achieved something good; that they’ve learned a thing or two and applied themselves to the  task at hand.  Now that our kids are easing back into face-to-face learning, opportunities abound for them to  discover new things—whether in the classroom or after school; rain or shine. Opportunities also  abound for them to get dirty. Breeze says, let them! Sige sa mantsa! When “dirty” is good  Let’s set the record straight: while health and hygiene are most definitely important, allowing  your child to get dirty also has its benefits. Countless studies have indicated that exposure to  germs and microbial ecosystems in childhood can actually help to strengthen a child’s  developing immune system, leading to lifelong health benefits. Top microbiologists caution  parents against “over-sterilizing” their environment, something which may seem counterintuitive  for most of us, especially nowadays. But, while we must keep our kids safe, mindful balance is  also necessary for overall health. Moreover, active play and hands-on activities fully engage your child’s senses and boost their  mental, emotional, and physical development. They enable your child to exercise and burn extra  energy, socialize in a non-classroom setting, and develop their talents. After all, classroom  learning, while essential, simply isn’t enough to help your child reach their full potential. Beyond the classroom  So, you realize the pros of getting your child involved in after-school activities, but the dilemma  now is: in a sea of stuff to do, which activities are right for your young one? There are a few  boxes you will want to tick, in the process of choosing an after-school activity. First, consider  your child’s temperament and interests, and go from there. Second, check the logistics and find  out if the activity is sustainable for both you and your child. Some questions you may want to  ask yourself include: is it cost-efficient? Easy to get to? Near enough to the school and to your  home? You may want to check what’s available on campus, as well; many schools have great  after-class programs. Third, narrow the options. Be careful to avoid the “burn-out” trap—in your enthusiasm to get your child involved in extra-curricular programs, you may end up signing them  up for too many activities. That is impractical and disadvantageous, for many reasons—not least  of which is that your child may get too tired and frustrated, defeating the very benefits of self enhancement these activities are meant to deliver. When you’ve narrowed the options, look into the top activities for kids: music lessons, dance classes, sports and martial arts programs, arts and crafts workshops, book clubs, among many  others. Most parents opt for these tried-and-tested after-school programs for their kids, as they  have proven to be engaging, entertaining, and exciting activities for a wide variety of ages. Think of the more unique, out-of-the-box activities, as well. Look into enrolling your child in a  beginner’s pottery class. It may be a messy affair, but will surely spark their creative flair! Is your  child into role-play or costume-play, at home? Consider hooking up with an acting club or  theater workshop. Maybe your young one enjoys making his or her own videos on TikTok or  YouTube? Then he or she would surely appreciate becoming part of a content creating or  multimedia arts group, where they can improve their skills at making their own home movies,  vlogs, and the like. Is your son or daughter a nature lover? Look into putting them in a gardening  club, where they will not only satisfy their longing to be in nature, but also learn more about  protecting their environment. The possibilities are, indeed, myriad, when selecting an activity or program for your child. There’s something for every age, temperament, inclination, and budget. Tough stains, be gone!  However, let’s face it: these activities will end up not only making a mark in your kids’ hearts and  minds, but also on their clothes—especially if the activity is outside during the rainy season.  Sure, stains can be a huge hassle for the mommies and daddies (and yayas!) in charge of  removing them. That’s where a robust stain-busting detergent like Breeze Power Machine  Liquid Detergent comes in.  Because it is formulated especially for top-loading washing machines, Breeze Power Machine  Liquid Detergent eliminates the need for the time-and-energy-consuming “kuskos and kusot”  typically associated with stain removal. Its advanced formulation dissolves quickly in water,  effectively penetrating fabrics to remove even the toughest of stains.

You read that right; Breeze Power Machine Liquid Detergent removes tough stains in one wash!  That’s thanks to what the experts call the “Golden Trio” of stain removal: surfactants that  remove oil and dirt from clothes; dirt lifters to get rid of stubborn dirt and to whiten fabric; and  enzymes that break down stains into smaller molecules. These powerful ingredients ensure a  clean and clear wash, and leave clothes smelling fresh, all day. The best of both worlds Now you know: you CAN have the best of both worlds, with Breeze. You can have your much desired cleanliness (and you won’t have to work too hard to achieve it), and you can nurture  your child’s holistic, multi-disciplinary development—without fear of dirt.

Guaranteeing a provision of the best possible care that takes the different aspects of human physiology into consideration, they generously welcomed the LIFESTYLE.INQ team into their clinic the other week to try out some of their most notable and coveted treatments. With its clinic located right in the heart of Makati City where highrises and busy offices dominate the sky, one would think that it would feel overwhelming. However, right as you walk through the doors of Fixilab, it feels the exact opposite. It’s easy to feel separated from the cluttered and congested metro in a space where you can properly rest and heal away from your worries. There’s a spaceship-like feel to the place, which is very much aligned with the theme of being futuristic. Each of their treatment rooms housed the different machines they had available, instantly transporting you to your own little pod of peace and quiet.    A post shared by FIXILAB Future Therapy (@fixilab.ph)   Taking a much-needed break, our team had the privilege to try out some of their advanced wellness treatments. Burdened by the accumulated aches and pains from the long days of work, we hoped to address our crackling backs, tight muscles, and other issues both physical and mental. Here are our notes and some thoughts on the selection we were invited to sample. What it is: Cryotherapy utilizes cryo-chambers containing liquid nitrogen brought to extremely low temperatures. Users of the machine are placed inside for around 3 minutes to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue and release endorphins that help soften skin, relax the muscles, reduce cellulite, aid recovery, and strengthen whole-body function. Who it’s for: Cryotherapy can be used by anyone looking to improve skin health, relieve joint pain & arthritis, support muscle recovery, revitalize brain health & cognitive function, address recurring body fatigue, boost skin healing, revamp the immune system, and fix sleeping patterns. “I’ve always been curious about cryo-chambers and this was actually my first time to try one out. Entering the room feels a little daunting given the loudness of the machinery and the intimidating presence of the device as a whole. It felt a little bit like I was going to get a lab test in a hospital, and the attendant briefed me on all the reminders I needed to keep in mind before the session could take place. Prior to starting out, you are asked to undress into a robe but are given leather gloves and winter boots to keep your extremities warm. Once you’re ready, Fixilab’s machine requires its users to stand in extreme cold for 3 full minutes and then you finish off the treatment with a quick session on an exercise bike to bring the heat back to your body. Although it got a bit uncomfortable towards the last thirty seconds, the session itself was not as hard as I imagined it would be—I was expecting it to be excruciating given that the temperature was apparently colder than in Antarctica. In terms of its effects on my body, I felt that during my “defrosting” period afterward, my body was a little more relaxed than before I came in as if the process was also melting away all the stored pain and tension that I had been holding onto for so long.” – Angela Go @iamangelago, Managing Editor  What it is: The Air Pressure Lymphatic Treatment uses pressure massage pants to relieve  and ease tension. It is greatly beneficial for slimming, recovery, and detoxifying the body, and is perfect for efficient workout recovery. Who it’s for: The treatment is just the thing for those seeking to reduce free radicals, address lymphatic drainage, detoxify and remove toxins in their body, improve lymph and blood circulation, relieve muscle pain and swelling, increase their metabolism, boost collagen production, and reduce cellulite. “I’ve always done my best to maintain an active lifestyle. Althoughout High School, I did Muay Thai, in college, I played Flag Football, and until now, I do my best to practice strength training at least twice a week. Recovery has always been one of my favourite parts of working out, and the Air Pressure Lymphatic treatment felt like the post-workout treatment I had been looking for my whole life. Other than it being excellent for reducing muscle pain and swelling, the treatment also helps address cellulite! It was incredibly relaxing and I actually fell asleep in the middle of it. I’m looking forward to going back and giving the treatment another go especially after a hard workout.” – Sophia Concordia @sophia.concordia, Associate Editor What it is: The EspineBOT utilizes 6 technology functions and dynamic stimulation to restore body alignment. Essentially an automated therapy bed of the future, the EspineBOT works to relax the muscles, maintain muscle tonicity, strengthen overall bone quality, and rejuvenate you from the inside out. Who it’s for: While free to use by anyone, the EspineBOT is best for those looking to relieve neck, shoulder, waist, and leg pain, improve lymph and blood circulation, reduce weight, alleviate muscle pains and swelling, fix sleeping patterns, strengthen bone quality with people experiencing osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, and soothe functional disorders of limbs caused by cerebral apoplexy. “As someone who is frequently stuck sitting behind the desk, the long hours in this undesirable and unnatural position have led to the development of different aches and pains all over my body. The perfect remedy to my situation, the EspineBOT really just invites you to lie down and let the machine do its work. Pretty much an automated bed, there were no specific instructions or scary containers and machinery to worry about, with the only requirement being to remove footwear, accessories, and gadgets. As I lay down, the EspineBOT began to vibrate and squeeze in repetition on various points across my body such as my feet, ankles, back, and neck. Supplementing the overall process was the dim lighting and the soothing audio that created a nourishing ambiance in the room that invited me to close my eyes and rest. Personally, no amount of back cracks and massages can compare to what it could do in a short amount of time.” – Martin Agustin @marts.agustin, Staff Writer What it is: The Infrared Sauna uses the combined power of heat and light to rejuvenate your body through increasing blood circulation with the formulation of new capillaries – speeding up the healing process of the skin, muscle tissue, and other parts of your body. Who it’s for: Sharing and improving upon the benefits of a regular sauna, the Infrared Sauna is an applicable treatment for those seeking to relieve chronic pain, nourish skin health, supplement weight loss, improve blood pressure, alleviate chronic health problems (congestive heart failure, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, headaches, and rheumatoid arthritis), enhance muscle recovery, boost brain health & cognitive function, and fix sleeping patterns. “As someone who loves a good ol’ sauna, the one at the clinic definitely got me excited. The infrared sauna offers the same benefits as the traditional one, made even better and without extreme heat (and extreme sweating!). An added bonus is not feeling too stuffy when inside the box. The heat from the red light claims to penetrate deeper into your skin and increase blood circulation to speed up the process of healing for the skin, muscles, and other parts of the body. With the high temperatures, I was told not to take my phone inside so being in the sauna was a welcomed distraction and a way to get some me-time even just for 20 minutes. I suggest you bring a book.” – Colleen Cosme @colleen.cosme, Editorial Assistant  What it is: The Oxygen Chamber therapy uses a Hyperbaric Chamber which is filled with 100% concentrated oxygen. Users are circulated with blood that carries this extra element throughout their body that helps fight bacteria and stimulate the release of substances called growth factors and stem cells, which promote healing and fight infection. While sustained exposure to higher concentrations of oxygen can be detrimental to one’s health, the chamber does not go to such lengths. Who it’s for: This therapy procedure is best for those looking to reduce constant irritation and stress in the throat and on the lungs, relieve recurring body fatigue, detoxify skin, lessen the probability of brain fog and mental confusion, recover from sports injuries, and improve sleeping patterns. It is also beneficial for those recovering from covid and those with ADHD. “My experience entering the oxygen chamber was very interesting. Once you enter the pod they start it off with slowly upping the air pressure until it reaches a certain point of some kind of relaxing pressure. The first 10 – 12 minutes may be kind of an uncomfortable feeling, to be specific what you feel is the air pressure coming in like taking off or landing from a flight. After that process tho you feel very relaxed and can easily end up falling asleep.” – JT Fernandez @skyline.jt, Staff Photographer The Verdict: Fixilab is definitely the kind of place that you would have to go back to multiple times to get the best results. This would mean having to be committed to regular visits and being willing to invest in the treatments. But all in all, their selection and location make it a convenient choice for people who really want to focus on their physical rehabilitation and get the best technology to help them heal. The sessions per machine are also quite quick, mostly lasting only about 20 minutes or less, so to make your visit worthwhile it would be ideal to combine two or more treatments for a whole afternoon of rehabilitation.

Boost your immunity and improve your stress levels with these effective approaches,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/430705/boost-your-immunity-and-improve-your-stress-levels-with-these-effective-approaches/,"06:04 PM October 20, 2022","One of the most important and extremely relevant wellness trends in our ever-changing world is about boosting immune health. You can practice the best workouts, diets, and achieve a normal weight (based on your height), but if your immunity is weak due to chronic stress, poor gut health, and other factors, then health problems such as flu, colds, skin irritation, digestive issues, cancer, and COVID-19 can harm your overall well-being easily. In my previous article, I discussed the latest and most effective movement strategies and principles (based on the Asia Fitness Conference I recently attended) that can help you age gracefully.  As a continuation of my recent conference learnings, for this week, I will share ways to strengthen the immune system by improving gut health and stress management. Autoimmune (lupus, type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis), immunodeficiency (AIDS and cancers like leukemia and multiple myeloma) disorders, aging, environmental toxins, excess weight, poor diet, chronic diseases, chronic mental stress and lack of sleep can all attack the immune system. But some immunity triggers can still be controlled such as your body weight and lifestyle. Aside from regular exercise and effective recovery strategies, improving your gut health should be prioritized since 70 to 80 percent of your immune system is located in the gut. Douglas Kalman, a professor, sports nutritionist and co-founder of International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) mentioned some practical tips in his session “Nutrition to Strengthen the Immune System.” Aside from controlling your food portions, knowing the right meal timing and choosing the healthiest foods for the body, you should also give importance to how you can effectively absorb the nutrients in your body so you can ensure that you are really getting all the benefits of good food (boost immunity, muscle growth, weight control and management of health issues), so you can achieve your health goals faster. Triggers causing intestinal damage that leads to food malabsorption include inflammation, nutrient deficiencies that are blood sugar issues, stress, menopause, pregnancy, toxins, food allergies, antibiotics and infections. Benjamin Siong, Australia’s leading body composition specialist and renowned international wellness speaker, emphasized the importance of effective digestion and food absorption in his lecture “You Are Only as Well as Your Gut.” You can’t fully avoid life stressors such as relationship conflicts, health issues, and daily workload. Stress is a part of life which can make you more resilient in facing life challenges as time goes by. But what you should avoid is excessive and repetitive stress occurrences (chronic stress) that can negatively affect the immune system (and your physical, mental and emotional state) that leads to serious health problems by being aware and doing something about it as early as now. In fact, a recent study published in the National Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) just last June of this year shows that stress (daily stressors, traumatic events, discrimination and job strain) can accelerate immune aging (or weaken one’s immune cells), but applying lifestyle strategies like healthy eating and undertaking active living may help offset this stress-related immune aging. Cameron McDonald, exercise physiologist, dietician and the CEO of Personalized Health Alliance (ph360 program), the world’s leading personalized health education and corporate wellness organization, discussed in his lecture “Personalized Stress and Recovery” how people respond differently to stress. A stressful event for someone can be very pleasant for another and this depends on one’s health type. For example, an intense workout such as running that can help release the stress of an active person can be super stressful for someone who finds calmness from doing a yoga class. Dr. Cam discussed the three major health types (activator, guardian and sensor) in his lecture and suggested ways on preventing and handling stress. As a ph360 health coach, I witnessed how my clients (who enrolled in the ph360 program) reacted differently with various stress triggers, so a unique approach should always be applied based on their health type. I also became more effective in dealing with stress ever since I discovered my own health type (activator) three years ago. Activator’s best stress prevention/management wellness strategies: Eating small frequent meals during the day (5 to 6 times), taking some short breaks during the day like lying down for 15 minutes or practicing short breathing exercises and incorporating workout sessions, preferably in the morning since they are early birds. Guardian’s best stress prevention/management wellness strategies:  Eating a light dinner, avoiding heavy food consumption of protein and carbs, scheduling heavy workout sessions in the afternoon (night owls) and spending time with family and low-maintenance friends. Sensor’s best stress prevention/management wellness strategies: Eating enough healthy carbs and highly digestible foods several times a day, undergoing relaxing mind-body activities such as yoga and Pilates, staying in a warm place, and avoiding chaotic environments with loud people.

"Eat more raw foods, less processed ‘junk’",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/428841/eat-more-raw-foods-less-processed-junk/,"06:38 PM October 04, 2022","As they say, we are what we eat. Our health status is highly dependent on the food we eat. Diet and nutrition are among the factors that impact our health, possibly more than the effect of the genes we were born with. We used to believe that our long-term health outcomes were mainly determined by our genes, like a preprogramming that could no longer be reversed or prevented. Hence, this was known as the science of genetics. But now, there are more adherents to the science of epigenetics, which literally translates to the science on top (epi-) of genetic or familial tendencies. One may be born with some genetic predisposition to develop a disease, say diabetes or heart disease, but such will not be expressed unless there are unfavorable environmental factors, mainly lifestyle factors, that will trigger its development. So it’s both nature (genes) and nurture (environment) that must both be present for certain diseases to manifest in an individual. One may have a strong familial or genetic tendency to develop diabetes, but if he or she is careful with his or her diet, exercises regularly, maintains an ideal body weight and makes sure to observe a generally healthy lifestyle, chances are he or she won’t become diabetic. Healthy lifestyle advocate Dr. Max Sidorov authored a book, in collaboration with other doctors in the International Council for Truth in Medicine (ICTM), on how diabetes could be put under control by intensifying healthy lifestyle changes, particularly our diet. Although I don’t quite agree with what he suggests that antidiabetic medicines and other medicines only make patients worse, his pointers on health and well-being are worth sharing. He and his colleagues at ICTM contend, rightfully so, that modern man is eating a lot of processed foods which he wasn’t meant to eat. Our body systems were intended to digest natural and raw foods. “The more natural and raw food you eat, the faster and easier you will lower your risk of countless diseases and regain your health,” he writes in his book. He advises us to shun “processed garbage food.” Instead, we should load our diets with nutritious fruits, vegetables, nuts, sprouted grains and other superfoods like raw unpasteurized milk, raw butter, spinach, spirulina and coconut oil. Why raw milk? He cites studies showing that the pasteurization of milk, which is intended to kill bacteria contaminants in the raw milk, also kills the beneficial bacteria called probiotics and eliminates all the vitamins, minerals and nutrients present in raw milk. Heating also denatures the proteins in milk, which has been implicated in some medical problems. So, the golden rule he recommends is to eat and drink everything raw as much as possible. Processed foods should be avoided, and consumers should prefer natural, whole, nutrient-dense alternatives. He realizes, though, that for those whose palates are accustomed to processed foods, changing one’s dietary habits is not an easy shift. He advises: “If you have a craving for some junk, always give yourself an alternative and allow the gradual change to take effect. Take healthy snacks with you, make your own lunch and get rid of all the temptations at home; throw away or donate all the junk food you have at home! And if you go to restaurants, find some local vegetarian ones, and taste for yourself how delicious and filling the meals can be.” Making the shift is really a big challenge, but one just has to make the decision, just like the decision to quit smoking for good. If one is not really strongly motivated to do it, one will most likely backslide at the slightest temptation. There are also some foods that may trigger inflammation of the cells when taken in excess. Examples are canola, corn, soybean, sunflower or safflower. Take these in moderation, since they may also cause some swelling of the linings of the arteries that can subsequently lead to heart disease and other problems. How about the regular or whole grain cereals we eat for breakfast, which are supposed to be healthy breakfast meals? Not quite so, writes Dr. Sidorov. They are “sugar bombs filled with inflammatory oils, colors and artificial flavors leading to fat loss sabotage and disease.” So what else can we eat and drink? We just have to go back to the golden rule—“Eat as much raw food and as little animal food as possible.” If the food is plant-based or tree-derived, it must be good for our body, especially when eaten as raw as possible. “As long as you eat more raw fruits and veggies, be they organic or nonorganic, you will have better health,” assures Dr. Sidorov.

Beware of ‘left toe spirosis’ and other ‘Wild’ diseases,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/429390/beware-of-left-toe-spirosis-and-other-wild-diseases/,"05:41 PM October 03, 2022","  I n his message in our Viber group a day after Supertyphoon “Karding” (international name: Noru) had left the country, Dr. Erric Cinco, current president of the Philippine Heart Association, warned that we should only wade in the flood with our right foot. Thinking it might be a recent discovery, a few of us immediately asked him why, and he replied that we should make sure that our left foot is safely above flood water, so as to prevent “left toe spirosis.” Of course, it was intended to be a joke on how one gets infected with leptospirosis, the notorious flood-borne infection that may lead to serious complications like acute kidney failure (uremia), liver inflammation (hepatitis), swelling of the heart (myocarditis) or its covering (pericarditis), the brain structures (encephalopathy) and eventually death. Leptospirosis is one of several infections associated with torrential rains and flooding. Our Department of Health (DOH) previously called them the “Wild” bunch. With the torrential rains, as we have had the past month, we may be at risk of getting this “Wild” set of infections unless we take precautionary measures. And depending on its severity, it might be potentially deadly. Children, the elderly, pregnant women and those with weak immune systems are more at risk to develop serious complications. So we better beware. By “Wild,” we don’t really mean any untamed or ferocious behavior making us acquire a disease, although the monsoon season can show a natural tendency for such ferocity with various natural calamities. “Wild” actually stands for four diseases that usually come with the rainy season. Wild, as coined by the DOH, is an acronym for water-borne diseases, influenza, leptospirosis and dengue. They can make our lives much worse than in prepandemic times, as they currently team up with COVID-19. Frequently, it’s difficult to distinguish just by signs and symptoms if it’s COVID-19 or not. Practically all of them will present with flu-like symptoms. Laboratory confirmation is needed to determine which type of infection one has. The main culprits for getting Wild are wading in the floods, drinking contaminated water and increase in the number of Aedes aegypti, the dengue virus mosquito-vector. Dr. Edward Tordesillas, former president of the Philippine General Hospital Foundation and an expert in Community Medicine, wrote in a comprehensive article on Wild published a few years ago how the public can prevent getting afflicted with any of the Wild diseases. Simple precautions like boiling drinking water, washing hands frequently and using boots when wading in flood water are effective preventive measures. Immediately washing thoroughly with soap and water as soon as possible after wading in the flood, staying away from crowded places, getting rid of potential breeding places for mosquitos and maintaining a strong immune system by having adequate rest and nutrition—all of these can go a long way in preventing Wild diseases, which can lead to serious complications, even death, in some patients. Influenza, or the common flu, is caused by a viral infection that attacks the lungs, airway and skeletal system. It’s pretty much the same as COVID-19. If a patient suspected with COVID-19 has negative antigen tests or nasopharyngeal swabs, the diagnosis is downgraded to influenza or simply flu. In general, flu is a self-limiting disease, and the individual with flu usually improves with just supportive care after a few days. Occasionally, though, especially in those with weak immune systems, the flu virus can also attack the heart, causing swelling (viral myocarditis), and the brain (meningo-encephalitis). The virus is usually transmitted via direct contact with a person who sneezes or cough. According to Dr. Tordesillas, it can also be transmitted through surfaces, material and clothing contaminated with the discharges of an infected person. Flu is best prevented by avoiding crowded places, covering one’s mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and practicing proper hygiene by frequent hand washing. For those with weak immune systems, having an annual flu vaccine is also recommended. Although wearing of face masks is now deemed optional outdoors, it may save one from getting Wild or COVID-19 when in close distance with other people, such as when commuting in public. In addition to what we already said about leptospirosis, it is a bacterial infection caused by leptospires or spirochetes. Dr. Tordesillas explains that it is usually transmitted through exposure to rat urine and feces, which may happen if we wade in contaminated floodwaters. The spirochetes can directly enter through broken skin and open wounds. One may also get leptospirosis by ingesting contaminated food or water. Some may get it through the eyes, nose, sinuses and mouth when in contact with contaminated water or soil. One usually experiences the symptoms seven to 14 days after exposure to floodwaters. The signs and symptoms are pretty much similar to the common flu, and include fever, muscle pain especially the calf muscle, and headache. One distinct sign is the appearance of reddish eyes. “Some severe cases, if not detected early enough, may lead to brain, liver and kidney problems,” warns Dr. Tordesillas. So, persons developing a flu-like illness two weeks after wading in floodwater should give that information to his/her doctor. Kidney complications sometimes require dialysis. Liver complications may manifest with yellowish body discoloration (jaundice) and dark-colored urine. “Awareness and prevention are very important,” Dr. Tordesillas emphasizes. So, swimming in floodwater is unforgivably foolish. Wading in floodwater should be avoided as much as possible. “It’s best to use boots,” advises Dr. Tordesillas. “Try to control rodents or rats in the household and maintain cleanliness in the house,” he adds. Dengue, also caused by a virus, is with us all year round, but the incidence increases during the rainy season because of the increase in the breeding areas for the female Aedes aegypti, the vector-mosquito. In a small percentage of patients, dengue may be fatal, causing bleeding and shock (dengue hemorrhagic fever). Not all cases of dengue should be admitted, though. Dengue without warning signs may be managed on an outpatient basis with close monitoring by the physician, up to a week after the fever has subsided. It can be misleading, and complications may happen when the fever has subsided already. Dr. Tordesillas advises confinement for dengue cases with warning signs, such as abdominal pain or tenderness, vomiting, mucosal or nasal bleeding, restlessness, decrease in platelet count and increase in hematocrit levels. “Hospitalization is necessary at this point for observation, monitoring and proper medical management,” he explains. Severe dengue, presenting with severe bleeding, severe plasma leakage leading to shock and respiratory distress, impaired consciousness, and signs of liver damage, leading to high levels of the liver enzymes (SGPT and SGOT), should be managed in an intensive care unit. Prevention is mostly environmental—by getting rid of mosquito breeding places, advises Dr. Tordesillas. The DOH has released the following pointers on how to get rid of breeding places: Cover water drums and water pails to prevent breeding; clean all water containers once a week; puncture or cut old tires used as roof support to avoid accumulation of water; and clear gutters of leaves and debris to prevent rainwater accumulation as breeding places of mosquitoes. So, let’s heed the precautions, and prevent getting Wild this rainy season. We still have our bag of worries full with COVID-19. Let’s not make it more complicated than it already is.

Take the lead in your life,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/429261/take-the-lead-in-your-life/,"05:33 PM October 01, 2022"," “Take responsibility. Don’t rely on others to make your life better.” —Najwa Zebian, “Mind Platter” We are all a work in progress! There is no need to rush out of life’s struggles, challenges and trials. If something is meant to be, it will happen in the right time, with the right people, and for the best reason. After cleansing myself of past toxicity and reflecting instead on what is essential, I finally have the strength to move forward with a conscious mind and a renewed soul. By wisely learning from my past shortcomings and living in the present fully aware and grounded, I am more focused on making my future better. From celebrated Lebanese Canadian poet and speaker Najwa Zebian, the insightful book “Mind Platter” has taught me wonderful and useful advice on choosing your fate by taking responsibility and by taking the lead in your life. We shouldn’t make ourselves part of others’ plans. We should make our own plans and be totally part of it. She shares, “You have a mind to lead you by logic and a heart to lead you by reason.” We cannot undo what has already happened, but we always have the ability to realign ourselves to what still needs to be done. We are all flawed with human imperfection; we stumble and fall and make mistakes, but we always have the choice to make everything right. Begin with a pure heart and true intention, and positive energy will flow freely from that point. After more than a year and a half of hiatus from the charity world, I am back! I am so delighted to be in the organizing team of The Pink Ball, a charity fundraiser for breast cancer awareness, spearheaded by the wonderful Estée Lauder Philippines team. The Pink Ball will be held at the Shangri-La Hotel at the Fort on Oct. 13. With our event plans solidifying and the party date drawing near, I have been going around town to solicit generous friends and sponsors at event after event, in the hopes of truly making an impact through our fundraiser. One of those outings was a lifestyle event hosted by good friend Pinky Tobiano at Rustan’s Shangri-La Plaza. Chemist and tablescaping queen Pinky has collaborated with so many global brands to enhance the dining experience; she loves entertaining friends, so Pinky makes her tablescapes very thematic and memorable. In this event, she worked with our country’s leading luxury retail destination, Rustan’s Department Store, who are celebrating their 70th anniversary this year. She presented three unique tables. The first is an eco-sustainable “Bahay Kubo” tablescape, featuring recycled materials like the walis tambo, and fabric accessories such as lampshades and birdcages. Pinky emphasized how this table signifies our responsibilities in fighting climate change. Inspired by the popular local folk song, “Bahay Kubo” features renowned Filipino painter Anita Magsaysay-Ho in Bernardaud plates exclusively available at Rustan’s Department Store Home Section. Pinky adorned the table with vegetables like kamatis, sitaw, mani, talong, singkamas and luya. The second table was a tribute to survivors; Pinky decorated the “Tickle Me Pink” tablescape to honor breast cancer warriors, and pay homage to ICanServe Foundation and Bosom Buddies. It is also a prelude to Pink October. “My mom and I are both cancer survivors,” Pinky disclosed. “There is a table that is a tribute to all the women fighting breast cancer. I salute the courage and resilience of each woman. May that table inspire all the people undergoing the Big C to continue the fight with love, grace and hope in the Lord.” The third table, “La Dolce Vita,” signifies Rustan’s fruitful 70th year celebrating life, love, family and excellence. Rustan’s has undoubtedly redefined upscale, luxury retailing through the years, and so the tablescape evokes only the finest and stunning details that capture the eye and ultimately lead to a sweet life. If you want to see more of Pinky’s work, her TV show “Tablelove by Pinky” airs on ETC every Sunday. Present among the VIP guests were the executive vice president of commercial and retail for Shang Properties, Inc. Joy Polloso, Pinky’s hubby Juancho Robles and her daughter Pianne Sinfuego. I was also able to connect with charitable friends Emerson Yao, who donated a beautiful ladies Omega watch to The Pink Ball auction, as well as Rich Teh, who offered us a white Vespa scooter. With her very altruistic heart, Pinky has pledged to support The Pink Ball, and she will bring former Governor Chavit Singson, who also promises to support us. I am so excited to conduct our live auction with my host partner Tim Yap. We will surely have fun working on getting the highest bids, especially for the Jewelmer pearl necklace that is being so generously donated by the international luxury brand. Jewelmer recently opened an exciting exhibition at the Mind Museum with curator Maribel Garcia and her team. It features the journey of the South Sea pearl, as well as Jewelmer’s environmental advocacies. An amazing short film on the beauty of the sea and Jewelmer’s efforts to preserve the ocean was showcased that evening. I can’t wait to visit Jewelmer’s pearl farm again and stay at their sister company resort, The Flower Resort in Palawan. This resort and many more island destinations are part of the 33rd Philippine Travel Mart (PTM) at the SMX Convention Center, Mall of Asia. Open only until today, PTM is one of the country’s longest-running travel exhibitions; it offers more than 200 exhibitors and promises accommodation, flights and domestic and international travel packages at discounted prices. “We’ve been waiting for a long time, and now is the perfect time to travel again, support local businesses, and explore the Philippines and beyond,” Philippine Tour Operators Association president Fe Abling-Yu said. The expo’s layout features different designated zones for various tourism products, such as sun and beach, marine sports, cruises, health and wellness, culinary, cultural, farm tourism, entertainment and meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions. Also included in this year’s PTM offers are tour packages in Bali, Siem Reap, Ho Chi Minh, as well as Japan, Malaysia and South Korea. The world is opening up, and so must our hearts. It is time to wash ourselves clean of the past, to let go of the baggage weighing us down, and to move forward into a better and brighter tomorrow. Surround yourself with love and positivity, realign yourselves to your goals, and let the universe show you just how good things can get.       Follow @seaprincess888 on Instagram.

Your ultimate guide to dealing with sugar cravings,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/429210/your-ultimate-guide-to-dealing-with-sugar-cravings/,"06:20 PM September 29, 2022","Do you always look forward to eating sweets? How often do you crave them? Do you find it hard to control your intake of cakes, cookies, sugary drinks and chocolates? The more you eat these ultra-processed products, the more that your body will crave them, which can lead to the development of an undesirable habit. Overconsumption of sugary foods can inflame your body leading to serious health problems. A study published in Jama Internal Medicine shows that eating overly sweet foods (mostly from added sugars) can increase one’s risk of dying from heart disease even if you are not overweight. Self awareness, preparation, proper nutrition, active lifestyle, stress management and sufficient external support should be considered as necessities in properly dealing with sugar cravings. I am sharing 20 of the best and proven ways to prevent sweet cravings based on research, personal experience, and the most effective strategies undertaken by my clients who have resolved their issues concerning sugar cravings. 1. Know your limits
According to the American Heart Association (AHA), women should consume around 6 teaspoons or 24 grams of added sugar per day and 9 teaspoons or 36 grams for men (desserts and sugary drinks) to avoid developing health problems such as obesity, diabetes and heart diseases. A 12-ounce serving of iced tea contains 35 grams of sugar and a slice of cupcake with frosting contains 20 grams of sugar. 2. Avoid hunger pangs
Skipping meals such as breakfast can cause hunger pangs and cravings during the day that can last even last up until late at night, especially if you are already up and active (physically and mentally) as early as 6am. 3. Don’t keep large portions of sugary foods at home
Birthday cakes are meant to be shared. Share the sweet gifts you receive from your friends and family and don’t keep everything at home. Even if you eat one slice of cake a day, you might end up eating the whole cake by yourself in a span of three to six days. Just imagine the amount of added fat and sugar you will put in your body. The same applies to keeping a big bags of chocolates and candies and boxes of cookies and donuts. 4. Prepare for your premenstrual syndrome (PMS) cravings
Track your monthly cycle and pay more attention to the prevention of sweet cravings between ovulation (usually 14 days since your first day of period) to the first day of your next cycle. This is the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle, when you are more susceptible to food cravings because of your hormonal imbalance (abnormal levels of estrogen, progesterone, estradiol and serotonin occurs) can cause intense cravings and hunger. 5. Consider the order of eating foods: Vegetables and protein first before carbs
There’s a study that shows that food order (eating carbs last) has a significant impact on one’s sugar level. Blood glucose regulation plays a big role in avoiding hunger pangs and food cravings. Try to eat your salad and chicken first before your brown rice and fruits and notice the effect on your desire for food after a couple of hours. 6. Incorporate vinegar in your meals
Combining vinegar with carbs such as bread can improve blood sugar and insulin levels which is important for controlling cravings and hunger. You can also try to mix one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with water before a meal, add vinegar with your dishes and/or or use vinegar-based dressings for your salad. 7. Avoid eating heavy refined carbs
Have you ever wondered why you still crave for sweets even after a heavy carb meal? It’s because having a big bowl of pasta or noodles filled with sodium and unsaturated fat (lacking in vegetables, proteins and healthy fats) will cause a sudden spike and drop in your blood sugar that results in more food cravings in just few hours after. You really need to balance your meals – combining healthy whole grain carbs (oats, brown rice, whole wheat bread and noodles) with lean protein (seafood, chicken without skin and 90% lean red meat) and healthy fats (olive oil, avocado, nuts, fish oil). 8. Add the right amount of fiber to your meals
Having the right amount of fiber in your meals can improve satiety and minimize your sweet cravings all throughout the day. Try to distribute your fiber intake (average of 20 grams/day) during the day depending on your number of meals – it can be three main meals (5 grams of fiber/meal) with a cup of rice or whole wheat pasta with protein and veggies and two snacks such as a handful of nuts or a piece of toast and a table spoon of nut butter (3 grams fiber/snack). 9. Always have your healthy sweet alternatives at home
The healthiest foods that you can eat when cravings occur are: Natural greek yogurt and fruits (such as strawberries, papaya, honeydew melon, avocado and guava), dark chocolate (at least 70%), fruit and veggie smoothie with almond milk, nut butter or protein powder, a handful of nuts (almond, cashew or walnuts) with a tablespoon of dried fruits (dates, cranberry, mulberry and/or raisin), sweet potato with a tablespoon (or less) of peanut butter. 10. Stay away from fad diets that often lead to mineral deficiencies
Caloric restriction and/or eliminating some foods groups from your diet can lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Lack of minerals such as iron and magnesium in your body can negatively affect your energy level that’s leads to sugar cravings. Ensure that you always eat a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals such as green leafy vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, seafood, lean meat, dairy, healthy grains and beans. Visit a health specialist to conduct a thorough assessment and identify the best management that can address your mineral deficiencies. 11. Avoid sweetened drinks
A 2019 study published in the journal Circulation shows that excessive consumption of sugary beverages such as fruit drinks, soft drinks (carbonated and non-carbonated), sports drinks and energy drinks has been linked to increase risk of death from a cardiovascular disease. A cup (or 240ml) of sweetened beverage contains between 20 to 50 grams (of 5- 12 teaspoons) of sugar, which is equivalent to 80-200 extra calories (4-10 percent of your daily calorie intake). 12. Control your urges for a strong cup of coffee especially in the afternoon when you are more susceptible to eating sweet snacks
A study shows that coffee can increase your tolerance for sweets, and in effect, your body might crave for more. In addition, the habit of drinking coffee especially in the afternoon can be a trigger for you to look for cakes or pastries to complete the whole coffee experience. Try to switch to a decaffeinated alternative and start breaking the habit of pairing coffee with sweet snacks. 13. Stay hydrated
Aside from bloating, dehydration can lead to cravings, due to the sugar imbalances happening in your body. It affects the liver, responsible for releasing the glycogen, which is a form of glucose that gives you energy. Lack of energy can lead to hunger pangs and sugar cravings. Try to drink a glass of refreshing water and see how it will affect your sugar cravings. Make sure that you are always well-hydrated during the day by setting up reminders (download hydration app or set alarms on your phone) and tracking your water intake. 14. Say goodbye to artificial sweeteners and consume foods with natural sweeteners in moderation
Studies show that the consumption of artificial sweeteners such as saccharin and aspartame that are found in ultra-processed foods (diet sodas, breakfast cereals, baked goods and jellies) can trigger sugar cravings especially when consumed frequently and in large amounts. You can treat yourself with sugar-free desserts instead, that contain the approved natural sugar substitutes such as stevia, monk fruit extracts, erythritol and xylitol so you can save calories and limit your over-all sugar intake. But, prioritize the intake of the more nutrient-dense foods (fruits, vegetables, nuts and healthy grains) to fill you up, instead of grabbing sugar-free desserts that often lack fiber, protein and healthy fat and carbohydrate. 15. Engage in daily movement regardless of intensity
Physical activity can help balance your hormones and sugar level, responsible for controlling your appetite and cravings. It can can also help distract you from thinking about food especially when you are bored, stressed and/or feeling down. Even light walking helps regulate your blood sugar after a meal, that can help combat your sweet cravings especially late at night. 16. Apply the principles of sports nutrition with your workouts
Exercising without proper nutrition often lead to sugar cravings, especially if the intensity is high and you disregard meal timing and quality. Prevent sugar cravings after an intense workout by having a nutrient-dense pre and post-workout meal at the right time (2-3 hours before and 15 to 60 minutes after exercise) complete with protein, carbohydrate and healthy fat. The ingestion these nutrients in one meal (with the right amount) can help slow down your digestion and can effectively regulate your blood sugar. 17. Get enough sleep
Lack of sleep (less than 7 hours) produces stress hormones such as cortisol, which increases your cravings for high-fat and sugary foods. Your decision making skills when it comes to choosing healthier food alternatives will also be affected, allowing you to just go for highly processed, sugary foods just to relive you from stress and satisfy your cravings. Prioritize sleep management to avoid late night cravings and to prepare your body for more movement the next day and to avoid serious health issues. 18. Apply mindfulness techniques
Mindless eating can lead to overeating and food cravings. Learn how to eat slowly so you can appreciate your food and reach that fullness and satisfaction that can help avoid sweet cravings after a meal. Keep a lifestyle journal of your sleep, exercise and food intake so you can identify and analyze the common triggers (stress, boredom, negative emotions, habit, availability, PMS, dehydration or lack of sleep) for your consumption of high-calorie foods such as cakes and donuts. 19. Get much needed support from your loved ones and/or health coach
Inform your loved ones how they can support you with your health goals – getting your husband or sister as your accountability partner, asking your mom to send you fruits instead of sweets treats and/or tell your husband to remind you to avoid ordering sweet treats from online food delivery services. Hire a credible and experienced lifestyle/health coach so you can get the right information (like ways on how to deal with your cravings and hunger to avoid health issues) and program that suits your goals, lifestyle, personality and health status. 20. Learn how to deal with sugar pushers effectively
Sugar pushers who always offer you desserts and send you sweet treats, can be one of your friends or a member of your family, so you cannot really avoid them. Instead, tell them that you are really trying your best to stay away from sugar and how this can affect your health and well-being. Or you just need to be honest and say “NO” politely, so you can continue to remain firm with your plans.

Teen suicide and other hazards of video games for children,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/427086/teen-suicide-and-other-hazards-of-video-games-for-children/,"05:59 PM September 26, 2022","A patient came back to the clinic much earlier than her scheduled follow-up checkup because of markedly labile blood pressure (BP) exceeding sometimes 180/100 mmHg. This is considered a severe BP level which might trigger life-threatening complications like a stroke or heart attack. She was complying with the dietary prescription and maintenance antihypertensive meds we gave her, so we wondered what could be causing her uncontrolled BP, and asked questions on possible high BP triggers. She confided that she and her husband were highly stressed for the last few weeks because of the aggressive behavior of their 10-year-old child. We suggested that they bring him to a child psychologist. Meanwhile, we also advised our patient to limit their child’s use of gadgets particularly for video game play (VGP). Many children are crazy about VGP to the point of addiction. The unfortunate thing is that some parents even encourage it with the belief that it can increase their children’s dexterity and could even improve their IQ. We now have robust scientific data indicating that this impression is erroneous and misguided. Although some scientific studies suggest that VGP may improve certain types of visual agility skills, negative effects of VGP outweigh them, with unfavorable effects on verbal memory, attention, sleep, learning and comprehension. Most children regularly engaging in VGP have demonstrated by sophisticated imaging studies that the release of the hormone dopamine is increased, which is associated with most types of addiction. It may be possible that VGP addiction may serve as a gateway for more serious addiction including substance abuse later on. A high level of dopamine makes one experience pleasure. Repeated exposure to an addictive substance or behavior such as playing video games conditions the brain cells in key areas like the prefrontal cortex—the area of the brain involved in planning and executing tasks—to crave and go after the substance or behavior causing the release of dopamine. The end result is being “addicted” to the source of pleasure, and in our children’s case—addiction to video games. Children are too young and yet immature to handle this sudden upsurge of dopamine in their blood. It may be akin to adults winning huge amounts in the lottery and not being able to handle it, leading to all sorts of disasters in their relationships and various aspects of their lives. Some scientists describe the effect of video games as “hijacking the pleasure center,” which is the same reward circuit in the brain involved with motivation and memory. Since an addictive behavior like VGP stimulates the same circuit, this part becomes “hijacked and overloaded,” unfavorably affecting the child’s memory, learning and motivation to acquire other knowledge and skills. Hence, for many children, they may prefer playing their video games than doing their school assignments or reviewing for their exams. The scientific literature already abounds with researches on the effects of VGP on children’s and even adult’s brains, many of which are associated with negative psychological consequences. Dr. H. Takeuchi, from the Division of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer at the Tohoku University, in Japan, published their study in the journal, Molecular Psychiatry, showing that more hours of video gaming in children are linked to lower verbal IQ and adverse changes in the brain’s white matter. These effects are likely to lead to long-term maldevelopment of verbal functions and other unfavorable changes in the dopamine-producing system of the children’s brains. The researchers used very sensitive, high-tech measures that can detect microscopic changes in the brain involving the dopamine-producing and dopamine-activated areas. They studied 240 Japanese Grade 4 children and younger (age range, 6-18 years; average of 12 years), and they ranked their VGP from none to four hours.The researchers reported that the more hours spent on video gaming, the stronger the association with lower verbal IQ and subtle changes on brain areas—described as loss of white matter integrity—suggestive of an addiction pattern. These changes were detected after three years of follow-up. Dr. Robert Kruger, a noted researcher and healthcare professional who’s not involved in the study, commented though that it’s difficult to conclude whether the structural brain abnormalities were the effect or the cause of excessive video game playing. “It is quite possible that children with lower IQs are drawn to gaming because of its intrinsic features whereas more capable children are attracted to more intellectual pursuits,” he wrote. Since baseline examinations of the brain were done which did not detect the changes, it’s more likely that the unfavorable changes were the effect rather than the cause. Parents must be conscious about these potentially life-damaging effects of excessive video game playing among children. It is not totally remote that these children would reach an addiction level when they would prefer playing their video games than engaging in more age-appropriate activities that involve more socializing with other children. The hampered socializing skills may be the cause of aggressive behavior, as in the case of our patient’s child. Aside from aggressive behavior, these children who engage in excessive playing of video games are likely to have socializing problems, substance abuse, depression and failure to cope later on in life. This might well be one reason we have an increasing incidence of children and teen suicide. Video games are actually just part of the bigger boon-and-bane, windfall-and-downfall packages which modern times offer. Other examples are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and the internet, which in general are good and enjoyable, but if we spend more hours in them than we should, they can cause subtle addictions that make us prefer virtual socializations to actual in-person encounters. Top that with the pandemic restrictions on social gathering, and the trap may simply be too big to avoid, unless we’re constantly conscious about it. Pray that we don’t fall into such a trap.

Pru Life UK takes care of the future of more Filipino families including the LGBTQIA+ community,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/428113/pru-life-uk-takes-care-of-the-future-of-more-filipino-families-including-the-lgbtqia-community/,"03:41 PM September 19, 2022"," Families, the basic unit of the society, may come in all shapes and sizes. However, the need to protect every member’s health and well-being is universal and crucial, especially during these uncertain times. The slow-but-sure social acceptance of adoptive and foster families, single parents and same-sex partnerships has given us a more inclusive approach to understand what constitutes a family. This has also changed the current perception of lifestyle, business organizations, and consumer behavior. Even when healthcare and insurance continue to evolve, some diverse families remain wary and fearful that access to comprehensive protection will remain a far-fetched dream for them. Getting an insurance for the family is the truest way to secure our loved ones’ future. Thus, it is a necessary opportunity for everyone—notwithstanding their age, sexual orientation, gender identity or setup—as health is a fundamental right that every individual should have access to. Pru Life UK recently launched PRUHealth FamLove, the company’s first-of-its-kind life protection product that can be availed by Filipino families of different types and sizes, including LGBTQIA+ couples, cohabiting partners, traditional and adoptive families, and single parents. PRUHealth FamLove is a trailblazing plan which enables one to share critical illness coverage illness with up to four eligible family members, all in just one plan. With this inclusive product, Pru Life UK stays true to its commitment of being a staunch ally of the LGBTQIA+ community. PRUHealth FamLove for Pride Pru Life UK is cognizant of the fact that every family member—whether in a traditional or unconventional setup—needs to be included when it comes to their rights to be protected and included. Chezka Carandang and Clare Inso, an LGBTQIA+ couple, who have been together for five years, couldn’t agree more.  Carandang, 28, is making waves in a male-dominated profession as a pilot, while Inso, 24, is making a name for herself as a model and endorser. The couple uses their social media platforms to inspire Filipinos, and advocate for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community.  These social media influencers met personally for the first time in Cebu, where Carandang moved for her job. Claire found in Chezka someone who’s responsible, affectionate, and could calm her down; Chezka found in Claire a person she could love every part of. Their relationship blossomed, and they instantly found a home in each other. And as they say, the rest is history.  What’s interesting about their union is that they do not expect each other to perform roles that society perceives as exclusive to one gender, because they acknowledge that they are both women. “We maintain a balance by expecting each other to work within our capacity, but also challenging our limits by learning new things,” they said. “When we contribute to our relationship, gender isn’t the basis. Both of us work so we can support ourselves, stay together, and fulfill our personal goals,” they added. Luckily for both, they are surrounded with people who are accepting and open-minded. Having come a long way in their journey in love, discovery, and empowerment as a couple, these Gen-Z influencers say their relationship is not any different from the traditional heterosexual ones. They simply express their love for each other and know how people understand that the point of their relationship is to cherish each other every day, be there for each other, and build a brighter future together. Both agree that the LGBTQIA+ community needs their acceptance, understanding, and recognition because all kinds of relationships deserve the same quality of rights and recognition. Acceptance of LGBTQIA+ relationships, Carandang and Inso say, should not merely be just lip service but should be proven through breakthrough concepts that are all-inclusive.  One of the issues that they would like to advocate is financial inclusion and security among the LGBTQIA+ community. Thus, having protection plans that cover all types of family setups, including theirs, is key. To be recognized by insurance companies and be covered by a protection plan means that they are accepted as a couple who can protect each other from the uncertainties of the future, making them feel included and honored, and their relationship validated. Fortunately, their advocacy is now amplified and supported by Pru Life UK. “Since signing up for Pru Life UK’s PRUHealth FamLove, I felt a sense of respect and security within my relationship. It’s a step forward to taking care of the future of the LGBTQIA+ community, cohabitating partners, and adoptive families,” Carandang confessed. And because she has personally experienced the negative impact of financial loss due to a family member’s critical illness, finally having this plan saves her from the possibility of experiencing that again. They hope that same-sex couples and LGBTQIA+ individuals alike don’t need to experience any form of prejudice or discrimination. “With the allyship of the rest of society, the world would be a more colorful place and a more comfortable space for everyone.  Same-sex relationships are just as committed, supportive, and nurturing as the rest that there is,” they emphasized. With Pru Life UK supporting the modern family setups, Carandang and Inso hope to continue using their ever-growing social media platform to educate, inspire, and empower Filipinos. The game-changer Recently launched by Pru Life UK—a leading life insurer with revolutionary concepts— PRUHealth FamLove is a yearly renewable protection plan available for all Filipino families that provides long-term coverage until age 85 (applicable when the premium is continuously paid) and help compensate the high treatment and hospitalization costs of critical illness, depending on the family’s needs. It is a unique product in the life insurance market with the System and Organ Function Insurance (SOFI) concept designed to provide a payout upon the occurrence of an event which critically affects a person’s health such as diagnosis of severe illness (cancer, heart attack, stroke), surgery, or when any of the covered systems or organs has been moderately or severely impaired or needs to undergo moderate or severe surgery, without the need to remember the long list of critical illnesses. Core benefits for the main life insured comprise Death Benefit, and Critical Illness Benefit (Moderate and Severe Critical Illness Benefit), while core benefits for other Life Insured (such as myPartner, myChild, myFamily, and myParents plans) are Family Extension Benefit (FEB) with Moderate and Severe Critical Illness Benefit. “We recommend PRUHealth FamLove not only to same sex couples but also to common law partners and families with adopted children. We all deserve accessible solutions to protect our financial security,” Carandang and Inso echoed. In a country where the recognition of the LGBTQI+ community’s rights is still a work-in-progress, they strongly believe that Pru Life UK’s progressive approach to life insurance will take the society a step closer to that ideal inclusive environment. Through the years, Pru Life UK has been a key player in advocating for financial inclusion and the company hopes to change the game for traditional and modern Filipino families. Now, every member of the household—from partners to children—can now be insured with just one policy. After all, family love is best expressed through our will and desire to protect our loved ones.

Stewardship is living a life of loving,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/428005/stewardship-is-living-a-life-of-loving/,"05:53 PM September 17, 2022","Sept. 18—25th Sunday in Ordinary Time Readings: Amos 8:4-7; Psalm 113, R. Praise the Lord who lifts the poor.; 1 Timothy 2:1-8; Gospel—Luke 16:1-13 In one of his August 2020 general audiences, Pope Francis spoke about how the pandemic revealed to us the paramount importance of solidarity and equality, emphasizing that we reflect God’s love for us by sharing the goods of the world, the blessings of creation. This is stewardship. This is the central theme for our reflection this Sunday. (With apologies for veering away from the details of the parable.) Five hundred years ago, St. Ignatius of Loyola gave us in his First Principle and Foundation (P&F), his idea of and road map to live out stewardship. He wrote (translated and adapted by Fr. David Fleming): “The goal of our life is to live with God forever. God, who loves us, gave us life. Our own response of love allows God’s life to flow into us without limit. All the things in this world are gifts of God, presented to us so that we can know God more easily and make a return of love more readily. As a result, we appreciate and use all these gifts of God insofar as they help us develop as loving persons. But if any of these gifts become the center of our lives, they displace God and so hinder our growth toward our goal.” “In everyday life, then, we must hold ourselves in balance before all these created gifts insofar as we have a choice and are not bound by some obligation. We should not fix our desires on health or sickness, wealth or poverty, success or failure, a long life or a short one. For everything has the potential of calling forth in us a deeper response to our life in God.” Three points to reflect on. First, stewardship is understanding the who and why of our life. Second, stewardship is knowing the how of living our life. Third, stewardship is love for God and others. In the first part of the P&F we see who we are, God creation, giving us life “without limit” out of love for us, and why we are here, “to live with God forever.” This is our intrinsic identity and mission. We are God’s creation, which gives us the fundamental ground of solidarity, i.e., the solidarity with the whole of creation, with the human family at its center. It defines our mission as living with God in eternity, a mission that includes the prudent use of all of God’s creation. And as Fr. Fleming put it, we achieve this by becoming a loving person towards God and others, and in all things. This is the how of living our life, to live it in love and put this in the context of the other readings this Sunday, love for the poor and holiness. As St. Paul put it (Ephesians 3: 17-19), “so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.” Our life, our stewardship, is to live and proclaim God’s love for all of humanity and creation. For St. Ignatius, one key element of holiness—the other half of how to live life together with love—is to live it with a sense of a healthy and balanced sense of detachment: “… we appreciate and use all these gifts of God insofar as they help us develop as loving persons … In everyday life, we must hold ourselves in balance before all these created gifts …” Stewardship as living a life of love is a life of loving and serving God and others. It is loving and serving that builds the human family in solidarity and fraternity. One of the early influences in my life as a priest is a line from the musical “Les Miserables”: “To love another person is to see the face of God and live.” This is our stewardship. It is all about God and others. It is about loving and living. Stewardship is the fullness of life.    CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Signs of work burnout—and what to do about it,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/427492/signs-of-work-burnout-and-what-to-do-about-it/,"04:40 PM September 12, 2022","You used to look forward to work. Just imagining how you’ll accomplish things excited you. Getting promoted was all you cared about, and nothing could stop you.
But that’s in the distant past. Now you seem to have lost your drive. There was a time you’d kill for your boss’ approval; now you couldn’t care less. You’re probably suffering from burnout. Burnout is included in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of Disease (ICD) and defined as a state of vital exhaustion. It is considered an occupational hazard.
It may feel like energy depletion, lack of motivation or losing your fire. To others, it may look like you’re not fit for your role, you’re a negative person, or you’re not competent enough. No one is spared from it. People across ages, positions and social status could experience burnout. High performers are more prone to it than others. In meta-coaching, we define the ideal working experience to be where one’s highest meanings and one’s performance converge. This is when one is able to live their highest purpose while being their best selves. This is the flow state where self-actualizers live (Q4 in chart). When people have great ideas but are not able to act on it, they’re called dreamers. It may be from lack of confidence, skill or opportunity, and can turn into frustration (Q1). When we don’t have robust meaning in life and don’t do work that excites us, this leads to boredom (Q2) where the underdeveloped live. They have a lot of untapped potential and just make do with the life they have. When people work endlessly on things that don’t align with their meaning, they live in Q3, and this often leads to burnout. It could be from overworking to the point that they sacrifice their well-being. The physical exhaustion leads to mental exhaustion, or vice versa. Many people start with so much drive and meaning and they get so deep into the how that they eventually forget their whys. There are some cases when people think they want something—like a position or a certain salary grade—that comes from an unhealthy space. An unhealthy space could be from insecurity, such as when they think they have to get to a certain post to have worth as a person or they want to prove to someone who bullied them that they are more than what they were judged for. When it comes to these survival and fight mode tendencies, when we work on ourselves and realize we are worthy and valuable despite social and corporate standards, the motivation to keep toiling goes away.  One client started getting coached because she wanted to be promoted to GM level, and she wanted to work on her opportunities to get there in the fastest possible time. As we went through our coaching sessions, we discovered that she was operating from the assumption that her worth is equivalent to her position. She didn’t have a good relationship with her emotions, and most negative ones were interpreted as threats. She took this to mean that she needed to be ahead of the pack so she’ll be out of danger. We worked on her self-esteem, being okay with not being perfect and creating a life she wants to live. When the time came that she was offered the GM role, she said no to it. She said she just wants to lay low. She didn’t want to exert so much energy impressing people anymore because she’s more than her identity at work. When we started to have coaching conversations on her purpose in life, she said she wanted to impact people. Her burnout from years and years of being in fight mode blinded her from the opportunity to create impact she’s been wanting, which was right under her nose. She may still want the same thing, but a different motivation is what will fuel the drive now. If you are feeling burned out, recognizing it while it’s at a low level makes it a lot more manageable. You can just click pause, let your body relax and do things you enjoy to rejuvenate the mind. This could do the trick, and you’ll come back to work refreshed and energized. If you are on the far end of the spectrum, ask yourself what you want your life to be about, what hopes and dreams will make it worth living. See if your current workplace could be a space for you to live it. If not, seek where you can actualize your best self while making your dreams a reality. To prevent burnout, take care of your mind and body. Create healthy boundaries between work and the rest of your life. What happens outside of the workplace fuels who you are in the workplace.

"Study: Chocolate lovers have lower risk of heart disease, stroke",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/427509/study-chocolate-lovers-have-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-stroke/,"04:40 PM September 12, 2022"," After one of our snack breaks in the clinic, a patient saw the empty foil of a dark chocolate bar behind our desk, and she teased us, “You’re so unfair, Doc. You tell us to avoid sweets but you’re eating chocolates!” We showed her the foil and explained that dark chocolate, not the more common sweetened milk chocolate, is an exception. It sounds counterintuitive, but dark chocolates and the moderate indulgence in them may be good for one’s health. Specifically, it can reduce the risk of developing heart disease, stroke and early mental or cognitive decline. We have to stress the “moderate indulgence,” since in excess, it may also be bad. Chocolates, in general, have earned the bad reputation for causing weight gain and metabolic problems like diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. But one need not worry nor feel guilty when eating a piece of dark chocolate. It can be both a delicious and healthful treat. Dark chocolate contains more cocoa, which is abundant in biologically active phenolic compounds. They help offset inflammation and oxidative stress in the cells of the body. In effect, they can help retard atherosclerosis, which is the slow, insidious process by which the arteries get clogged leading to organ dysfunction. This is especially true for the heart, brain, kidneys and other vital organs. Cocoa is basically the source of chocolate’s benefits, and so, the more the cocoa content as in dark chocolates, the more are the likely health benefits. Dark chocolates also contain less fat and sugar, so they don’t taste as good as the regular sweetened milk chocolate, but just think of the benefits you can derive from them. Always check the label to see if it has more cocoa, and less fat and sugar. Because of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, cocoa in dark chocolate has been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. In a study presented in the European Society of Cardiology scientific sessions and published in the British Medical Journal, British investigators reported that chocolate lovers had a 37-percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 29-percent lower risk of stroke compared with individuals who rarely ate chocolate. However, in a media interview, Dr. Adriana Buitrago-Lopez (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom) and colleagues stressed that all types of chocolates, in general, have to be taken in moderation and warned about the possible adverse effects of excessive intake. Sweetened chocolate products may contain too many calories and can possibly lead to being overweight and obesity. “Although overconsumption can have harmful effects, the existing studies generally agree on a potential beneficial association of chocolate consumption with a lower risk of cardiometabolic disorders,” the study authors stated. “Our findings confirm this, and we found that higher levels of chocolate consumption might be associated with a one-third reduction in the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.” The authors attributed the favorable effects to the high content of polyphenols present in cocoa products. Polyphenols are substances that can enhance the body’s production of nitric oxide, which dilates the blood vessels and enhances the integrity of the arteries. By doing so, the progressive narrowing of the arteries, called atherosclerosis, is markedly slowed down. Medical science labels this benefit as an enhancement in endothelial function. But aside from this, the polyphenols in chocolates can also prevent the clotting of blood inside arteries by reducing the stickiness of some blood elements, such as the platelets. Chocolates also have beneficial effects on the blood pressure. Paradoxical as it may sound, the polyphenols in chocolates may also help regulate the secretion of insulin and help control blood sugar and cholesterol levels. So, contrary to what many believe, moderate chocolate intake may actually help prevent diabetes. It’s fair to assume, though, that dark chocolates would be more beneficial. However, in their pooled analysis (meta-analysis) of seven studies, overall chocolate consumption was recorded and analyzed without distinguishing between dark and milk or white chocolate. Chocolate in any form was included. Asians were included in one of the studies in the analysis. Overall, the pooled meta-analysis found that moderate levels of chocolate consumption compared with the lowest levels of chocolate consumption reduced the risk of any cardiovascular disease by 37 percent and stroke by 29 percent. There was also no association noted between chocolate consumption and the risk of heart failure, which was a previous concern. No risk of developing diabetes, particularly in women, was observed. This study actually validates similar findings of previous meta-analyses and other studies in different populations suggesting a relationship between chocolate or cocoa consumption and heart diseases with metabolic disorders in the body. Another promising potential benefit of cocoa is that it may help prevent mental decline and dementia in the elderly. Based on a study, researchers from the Harvard Medical School have suggested that consuming cocoa regularly from chocolate drinks or dark chocolate bars could help maintain normal brain function and reduce memory decline in the elderly. This was because of the improvement of the circulation to key areas of the brain. Dr. Farzaneh Sorond, the study’s lead author, explained: “As different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks, they also need greater blood flow. This relationship, called neurovascular coupling, may play an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer’s (disease).” An earlier study, published in 2014, indicated that lavado, washed or fermented cacao, helps preserve integrity of nerve pathways, which could retard symptoms of cognitive decline. Other authors suggest that even just once-a-week consumption of cocoa may stave off early mental decline. It’s well known that chocolates are good energy boosters. It can help enhance athletic performance. In a study published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, the authors suggested that even small amounts of dark chocolate might boost oxygen levels during fitness training. Researchers in the United Kingdom also studied the performance of cyclists doing time trials and found that after eating dark chocolate, “the riders used less oxygen when cycling at a moderate pace and also covered more distance in a two-minute flat-out time trial.” They also attributed this to the blood-vessel dilating effects of the polyphenols in chocolate. The study also showed that beetroot juice has a similar effect. So, adding chocolates to your dessert plate may not be such a bad idea. It’s not a “sinful” indulgence that you must feel guilty about.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
How to avoid late-night eating,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/412806/how-to-avoid-late-night-eating/,"05:41 PM August 19, 2022","Do you start your day with a positive vibe, a healthy breakfast, and an energy-booster workout, but find it challenging to control eating late at night? Most people can perform well during the day when it comes to eating and exercise, but struggle to address some lifestyle issues late at night. Eating behaviors later in the day should be given more attention to, especially at this time (while we are experiencing the negative health effects brought about by the pandemic) for long-lasting weight control and health management. I discussed in my previous article the best time to exercise that can match your goals, lifestyle and body type. In the latter part, I mentioned eating most of your calories during the earlier part of your day and avoiding food intake close to bedtime. This week, I will focus on strategies to avoid late-night eating so you can avoid health issues and continue to achieve your fitness and weight goals. A 2020 study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism shows that eating late at night may contribute to weight gain due to a higher increase in blood sugar (higher by 18 percent) and lower fat burn while you sleep (lower by 10 percent). To manage your weight, you need to maximize your calorie burn not only during your waking hours but even while you are asleep. You can only achieve this by getting the right amount of movement, eating the right amount of food, and giving importance to recovery -everything should be combined with the proper timing of exercise and food intake. Eat during your most active hours during the day when your energy is high and your brain is fully functioning Consume most of your calories during the early part of your day (breakfast or lunch) so you  can maximize your energy in performing the most important tasks for the day needed by your body and brain. Strategically match the timing of your meals with your activities. You need to have a well-conditioned body so you can perform well in your fitness and/or sports activities, daily household chores, daily errands, and your job requiring your physical energy. You should be mentally sharp during the day so you can perform the most- needed mental tasks for problem-solving, concentration, planning, organizing, learning new skills, and control over emotions and behaviors.  Stay away from lifestyle habits that can contribute to disturbed sleep such as late-night eating, intense physical activities, and drinking caffeine and too much alcohol. You don’t need extra calories late at night because you should be preparing your body already for rest and sleep. Late-night eating can disrupt your body clock, which can lead to more serious health problems such as insomnia, impaired fat metabolism, mental issues, gastrointestinal problems, and cardiovascular diseases.

Anxiety over in-person classes: Focus on things you can control,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/411672/anxiety-over-in-person-classes-focus-on-things-you-can-control/,"03:33 PM August 02, 2022","   My kids’ school began a hybrid of in-person classes and online distance learning. It’s been bittersweet. We were on a rollercoaster of emotions in the days leading up to it. I recall the weeklong orientation the kids and parents had during home learning last school year. It was leadership training based on Stephen Covey’s book “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” It was surprising to see something I read a lifetime ago be resurrected in a child-friendly fashion, with my first and fifth graders filling out a 7 Habits bingo card over the weekend, ticking off things like “take a walk with your family.” According to the World Economic Forum, to thrive in the 21st century, students need more than traditional academic learning. They must be adept at collaboration, communication and problem-solving, which are some of the skills developed through social and emotional learning. “Children need to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, make responsible decisions, feel and show empathy for others, and establish and maintain positive relationships,” said Janita Andersen, FranklinCovey’s regional lead coach for Asia-Pacific Leader in Me International and higher education director, in a webinar for parents. As regular classes unfurled, I would hear teachers ask the kids how their task tied into which habit. Andersen said that when we instill habits early in life, we build core character at a young age when they are very thirsty for learning. In the webinar, she asked what challenges students face today. Parents responded: having a hard time focusing, no physical interaction/socialization and too much screen time. She said these adverse childhood experiences, traumatic events that occur between 0-17 years old, can impact kids’ health greatly at the time it is experienced and later in life. The World Health Organization called it a public health problem. Andersen admitted skepticism until she saw the 7 Habits at work in a kindergarten in North Carolina and other schools. She showed videos of children explaining the habits in their own words. Habit 1: Be proactive. How are you going to choose to act today? This empowers kids to take charge and take responsibility. It reminds them that they can make good choices and that they’re in charge of themselves. They can help others and do things without being asked. They can stay organized and responsible, and take the initiative to do what they know is right. Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind. This is about defining outcomes before you act. Kids are encouraged to have a vision and plan what they’re going to do. Setting goals, working toward them and thinking before speaking are nurtured. Habit 3: Put first things first. Tackling “big rocks” like homework first and “little rocks” like play later build integrity. Putting on your sock before your shoe shows how you shouldn’t dillydally. Habit 4: Think win-win. How can we both be happy? Fostering this abundance mentality means thinking of mutual benefits for everyone. When a child believes that everyone is valuable, they will have a spirit and soul committed to service. Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood. Empathic listening is stopping long enough to pause and listen first before you say something. Holding back your thoughts is a skill that needs to be developed. Habit 6: Synergize. It’s no fun to play tag just by yourself. Finding new ways and opportunities boosts creativity. Valuing differences, everyone’s worth and potential leads to creative cooperation. When kids work together, they learn to build on each other’s ideas. Habit 7: Sharpen the saw. Do what makes your heart happy. Your saw gets dull when you’re too busy to sharpen it, so you’re not effective. When you take care of your body, mind, heart and soul, you enjoy a balanced life. This teaches kids to take time to do something they like: read, watch a movie, exercise or spend time with family. The kids demonstrated practical applications in their lives. Andersen said, “They learn and then they do. They internalize it in every subject and are given opportunities to practice it even in small ways. It’s real-life stuff that becomes a natural extension and embodiment.” She advised parents to teach and model the habits at home, to focus on what can be controlled or influenced and to be proactive. She shared tips and examples: “What can we control? Our positive attitude, turning off the news, finding fun things to do at home, our social distancing, our kindness and grace and limiting social media.” “We cannot control the actions of others, predicting what will happen, how others react, the amount of toilet paper at the store, how long COVID will last, other people’s motives, if others follow rules of social distancing, so let go of these things.” Andersen added that when you focus on your circle of control, you get confidence, calm, ability, peace, security, happiness, relief and fulfillment, not stress, anxiety, depression and frustration—by choosing to live intentionally. When we’re faced with a challenge, our self-talk can be: “’Okay, so in this situation, what can I do? Who can I be?’ How powerful that can be!” she exclaimed. We often feel stressed, powerless or hopeless when we don’t have control of our lives. Become empowered by listing things in your circle of control, things you have no control over and commit to taking charge by being in your circle of control. “Use the language. Build the skill and use the tools,” she advised. —CONTRIBUTED   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
"12 years and a pandemic later, this Filipino bakeshop continues to rise to the occasion",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/411527/12-years-and-a-pandemic-later-this-filipino-bakeshop-continues-to-rise-to-the-occasion/,"03:37 PM August 01, 2022","Pearl de Guzman of Baby Pat Breads and Pastries finds herself bringing together an assortment of flavors into a bright, tight package of soulful ensaymadas. But don’t let the signature color-coded wax paper wraps lure you into thinking that it’s simply an array of vibrant specimens of yet another classic pastry. In many ways, the home-based bakeshop derives from, deviates from, and devotes to a heartwarming legacy. Established in 2010 in memory of her mother Patria Ramirez Macalindong, or “Mama Pat” as she is fondly known, de Guzman isn’t one to shy away from embracing her heritage and kicking off an experimental sense of fun. “It was my way of keeping her alive in my memory and my life. I grew up with her baking and tending our modest bakeshop, Pat’s Cake House, in Cavite City in 1976. Remembering my mother and her love inspires me to continue her legacy.”  Granted, the pastry chef’s ensaymadas don’t push boundaries per se with the types of relatable ingredients (for example, tablea from Iloilo, ube, and Chocnut) on display. However, the constellation of products is worth wallowing in for the simple reason that these are delicious products of Filipino legacy. Where others may feel excessive with their play on flavors, nothing here screams contrived. It’s all just a celebration of decadence that flirts with high-quality execution. The classic ensaymada is predictably good with a textured sugar coating enough to contrast the mildly chewy pastry; rich but not overpowering. De Guzman’s forays into local flavors meanwhile sees her wielding her understanding of the Filipino flavor palate. “An ensaymada with ube halaya is traditional. It is one of the baked products that my mother’s bakeshop was renowned for,” she says. Her version that incorporates queso de bola is a piece fleshed out of her Caviteño heritage and a need to respond to the sophisticated tastes of the current generation of well-traveled Filipinos. You can also see this on the Speculoos ensaymada where the generous smearing of the cookie butter spread feels primed to occupy all-day appetites. “My son Patrick loves this flavor he discovered in the Lotus Biscoff cookies served as a snack while on a Delta flight,” she says. You do taste the creamy and caramelized gingerbread flavor and the heft of the dough with each bite, and unlike other ensaymadas, the tastiness doesn’t get lost in fluff or air. Shelf life is a core strength, too—you can refrigerate or keep them in the freezer for up to two months. The rest of the product lineup is filled with similar moments, from the tablea, latik, and peanut butter-Chocnut ensaymadas to the newly rolled out cream puffs and Pinoy rolls.   Making, baking, and perfecting pastry may be one of the toughest requirements in running a home bakeshop but hard work alone isn’t a silver bullet to the blows of the current pandemic. Even so, de Guzman took the strange global affairs in stride. “The disruption has compelled us to improve our health safeguards for baking and [an] online system for business transactions. Although personal pick-ups and handovers of orders have lessened, door-to-door deliveries have increased,” she says.  The fact that de Guzman used this time for self-improvement and for helping delivery service providers is proof that sustaining a legacy brand doesn’t just mean sticking to what’s always worked out. There’s something to be said for molding a business plan to attune to the signs of the times, especially now when Filipino consumer behavior and taste preferences constantly swirl in dynamic directions. “I am aware that times have changed and so do the tastes and likes of Filipinos as they travel, explore, and discover more new foods,” de Guzman says, admitting this is a constant challenge to bakers like her who aspire to offer the best possible products to a fickle Filipino market. But if the versatility and execution of Baby Pat Breads and Pastries are anything to go by, anyone can find redemption even in the most trying of times. “Bake with pure passion and pleasure, constantly improve, innovate, and commit yourselves to excellence,” she says. De Guzman knows exactly what kind of products she wants to churn out and what type of brand she wants to bring into the future: a self-assured bakery designed to both satisfy and challenge expectations.

We are the choices we make,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/410474/we-are-the-choices-we-make-2/,"02:32 PM July 16, 2022","“If your choices are beautiful, so too will you be.” —Epictetus Simple, but true: we are the choices we make. Whether deliberate or not, big or small, we need to make good choices in life so that all will be well. The daily choices we make have the capacity to change the trajectory of our entire lives. This new chapter in my life has been filled with so many family-centered choices. Though I feel that more and more social events are happening again, I have prioritized my time to keep my kids in the loop. I am glad that my daughter, Jordan Valdes, is visiting from Siargao with her surfer beau, Darud Boticario. Both of them joined me in some of my affairs around town. We attended the recent art exhibit of my Assumption classmate Connie Quirino, youngest child of Tomas Syquia Quirino and Conchita Rastrollo. Connie took art classes in the ’80s with her mentor and renowned painter Federico Aguilar Alcuaz. Little did she know that her first teacher then was destined to become a National Artist. For 12 years, Connie trained under L’Arc en Ciel run by Elaine Herbosa. These talented artists have had several successful group exhibits. Connie shares that life has taught her many lessons, and one of them is perseverance. She says, “I realized that no matter what happens, art will survive and endure. And as an artist, I will continue to pursue my own definition of life through my works.” With her manager and celebrity sister Cory Quirino, Connie has staged many art shows, with the latest one called “Bold and Beautiful” at the Art Gallery of Fashion Interiors, Makati City. Connie’s 50-piece solo exhibit is a fine balance between portraits, nudes, still lifes and landscapes. I’ve been extremely proud of Connie since her first solo exhibit in 2001 titled “Romancing Life,” where Alcuaz was her guest of honor. Since then, her work has traveled the world with her, even all the way to New York. She is now back in the Philippine art scene. From Connie’s exhibit, in true Tessa fashion, I rushed to another event at Palms Country Club (Laguna Heights Drive, Filinvest City, Alabang, Muntinlupa; tel. 7738-7826, 0926-6899014, 0927-3242984). Kartini Asia celebrated 20 years of business with the grand opening of the “Iconic Pinoy Art” exhibit. The exhibit features magnificent renditions in painting and sculpture of renowned Filipino artists, which is a testament to Kartini Gallery’s advocacy in promoting Philippine art. The exhibit showcases the genius of Joe Datuin, who was internationally acclaimed in the field of sculpture after he won the grand prize in the 2008 Beijing Olympics Art Contest (Sculpture Category) with his “Dancing Rings” rendered in stainless steel, besting artists from more than 30 countries. The exhibit also features widely acclaimed artist Manuel Baldemor with his latest landscape compositions; the jeepney compositions of artist Jojo Garcia; the romantic abstractions of Jeff Dizon; Gilbert Angeles’ recycled art series made from plastic sachets; the acclaimed Mother and Child renditions of Aris Bagtas; and the winning pieces of Dale Bagtas, who won both the GSIS and Metrobank competitions in 2021. Kartini Asia is also celebrating this year the addition of The Palms Country Club as its latest business address for Kartini Gallery, and its flower shop, Kartini Flora, located on the first floor.  There is no doubt that the world is opening up again, both with social events and new opportunities. With these fresh beginnings coming our way, it is vital that we take precaution in protecting our mental, physical, and spiritual health—ensuring that we always make the right choices for ourselves and those around us. Personally, my healing power of choice is shopping! Check out this weekend’s Katutubo pop-up bazaar (The Bench Tower, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig; @katutubopopupmarket on Instagram).

"You get ‘hangry,’ but here’s why fasting is beneficial",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/410163/you-get-hangry-but-heres-why-fasting-is-beneficial/,"04:47 PM July 11, 2022","The “hangry” in the title of this column is not a careless typographical error. Researchers from the Anglia Ruskin University in England have concocted the term as a combination of being hungry and angry, which they implied is a real mental state one could be in. We’ve been advocating intermittent fasting, the one-meal-a-day (Omad) diet and supervised two- to three-day fasting in suitable individuals, as an effective supplemental treatment for those with various cardiometabolic conditions like obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hypertension and waning stamina. But we’ve always warned that, initially, it can be a challenge, and one may tend to be moody and irritable as the stomach starts to grumble. After some time of conditioning, though, the stomach settles down and becomes pacified with just a few sips of water or clear broth. The “hangriness” also dissipates, and one’s mood in fact improves. A hangry mental state may also be experienced even by people who are not fasting. Diabetics who are taking medicines that lower their blood sugar levels may also feel it when they fail to eat their meals on time, and their blood sugar levels dip, a condition known as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels). Whatever the cause is of the hangriness, Dr. Varin Swami, lead author of the study, advises one must be able to promptly identify hunger-related emotions and know how to address them. When one starts to notice one’s fuse is getting short and one loses one’s cool at the slightest provocation, their hypoglycemia may be the culprit. Swami, who is a professor of social psychology at the Anglia Ruskin University, said in a media interview that the hungry state can influence our behavior in our everyday lives. So, he and his colleagues studied the “impact of hunger and eating on human emotions and behaviors.” They invited 121 participants, 18 years old to 60 years old (average of 30 years), to take part in a daily survey for 21 days. A more extensive final survey was conducted on day 21. At least 74 completed the daily surveys, with 64 able to complete the final survey. The daily surveys were brief surveys on multiple (average of five times), semirandom occasions throughout the day. These asked participants to rate their emotional state at that specific time as well as their feelings of hunger, irritability and anger. They indicated the time they last ate before the survey. In the final questionnaire, the study assessed different dietary behaviors, like how they addressed their hangriness. Did they eat when they felt irritated or when they had nothing to do? The questionnaire also used a well-established set of questions to assess aggression in adults. Based on the responses to the daily and final surveys, hunger was significantly associated with greater level of anger and irritability, together with a lower level of pleasure during the 21-day study. They concluded that the feeling of hunger negatively affects our emotions. And being hangry is a real mental and emotional state that people must recognize. “Being able to label those emotions, ‘I am hangry,’ provides clues about how those emotions can be dealt with,” said Dr. Swami. What could be the physiological explanation for being hangry? Dr. Timothy Sullivan, chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Staten Island University Hospital in New York, explained in his interview with Healthline News: “We know in general that when we experience emotions, our minds survey our internal physiological states in order to construct an assessment of our mood.” Sullivan reviewed the data but is not a coauthor in the study. He added that because of this normal reaction of the mind, states of physiological weakness or vulnerability, such as hunger, can “trick” the mind into associating those physiological sensations with moods. This “construction of associated emotions” is largely a “consequence of that process of introspection,” explained Sullivan. The hangry finding in this study is nothing really novel. We’re sure everyone has experienced it at various times. But it may be important to take a closer look at the findings, as this can have implications on the times of day when meals should be taken and the frequency of meals or snacks during the day one should have. Our concern is that it may be misinterpreted that one should eat more frequently and take in more calories to prevent being hangry. That would only aggravate the overconsumption problem that’s causing most of the metabolic problems we have now, like obesity, diabetes, abnormal cholesterol levels, hypertension and even dementia. This is the main reason we recommend appropriate forms of fasting for everyone. It can do a lot of wonders for our body. We acknowledge that the hangry state is a potential negative consequence of fasting. But just like most of our mental states, it’s something that can be changed by simply tweaking one’s perspective or mindset. If one looks at the hungry state as an undesirable consequence which one did not really choose to have, the whole body will behave accordingly and one’s emotions will likely be negative, resulting in increased irritability, anger and possibly aggressive behavior. On the other hand, if one looks at one’s fasting as a form of lofty sacrifice or as a healthy means to cleanse and repair one’s body, then all sensations and emotions are sublimated and one may feel more mentally alert and productive during the fasting state. We were also a skeptic of fasting before, but when we tried it at the start of the pandemic—as a gesture of empathy for those who were starving or were just making do with one meal a day—we noted palpable benefits to our health after some time, so we continued practicing it and recommending it to our patients. Many of our patients are not able to sustain it in the long term, precisely because of the hangry state, but for those who persevered, they have learned to tame their hangriness and enjoy the benefits of better health with less pills to take for their hypertension, diabetes and cholesterol levels. A notable benefit of any form of fasting is enhancement of brain function. This is likely because the body’s metabolism shifts from deriving energy from glucose to fats, which is a more efficient source of energy particularly for the brain. One should not worry that the hangry feeling means that the cells are already starving and might die, so one must immediately replenish one’s glucose or sugar state. The impulse is to immediately take in a candy or sweet drink when one feels hungry and hangry. This may be the correct approach for diabetics with low blood sugar levels because of the antidiabetic tablets they are taking, but for most individuals who have no contraindication to fasting, there should be no worry about hypoglycemia because the body can efficiently shift to burning fats for energy. If one is overweight or obese, one can have enough stores of fats to burn even for prolonged fasting, but we don’t recommend fasting for more than three days at a time unless supervised by a physician. Can diabetics still fast? We believe that they can also benefit but they need to be closely supervised with doses of their antidiabetic meds adjusted. We had a middle-age patient who was on near maximum doses of three antidiabetic pills, subsequently being controlled with just two pills and at less than half the doses. Many of the benefits of fasting can be attributed to changes in hormones, expression of our genes and functioning of our cells. Yes, one area that is particularly interesting is the potential benefit of preventing cancer with a regular practice of fasting. The old thinking was that if one has strong genes to develop cancer, one will likely develop it at some stage of one’s life. Recent data suggests this is not so. We’re not stuck to what kind of genes we have; its final expression may vary, depending on the internal and external environment the genes are exposed to. So, one may have the gene predisposing him to a certain cancer, but if the hormonal (internal) environment plus the external environment (lifestyle) are favorably modified, the chance of the individual developing cancer is significantly reduced, and the cancer may not express or manifest at all. Because of the favorable hormonal effects fasting has been shown to produce, the cells in our body also initiate important cellular repair processes such as autophagy. This is a starvation-induced beneficial process wherein the body breaks down old and damaged cells or abnormal cells, which may include cancer or potentially cancerous cells. It’s like a decluttering or recycling mechanism of the body to make good use of the old and damaged cells, and get rid of cells that could be harmful to the body. Another benefit of fasting is the reduction of inflammation in the body. We may not be aware of it, but because of the so-called oxidative stress we get from the environment (air pollution, smoking, unhealthy lifestyle, stress, etc.), there’s an insidious process of inflammation or swelling taking place at the cellular level, causing the early degeneration of our organs, subsequently leading to disease and premature death. Data is now fairly robust that fasting can effectively reduce oxidative damage and inflammation in the body, which can favorably impact against aging and development of the common lifestyle diseases, like cancer, heart, lung and brain diseases. So, despite the potential downside of being hangry, we still recommend regular fasting for most, but it’s best to consult your physicians first if you have health issues like diabetes and heart disease, and are taking medicines for it. You have to be closely supervised, and blood levels of certain parameters may need to be monitored to guide your doctor in the adjustment of your medicines.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022

If your focus is on improving your energy and maintaining it long-term, then you will do your best to eat the right type and amount of food so you can exercise well, and effectively burn calories, while improving your fitness level and sports performance. You will abandon the thoughts of food deprivation and excessive caloric restriction. You will focus on effective recovery. You will always strive to find that balance in your lifestyle, and get the right dose of challenge, so you can prevent burnout and boredom. It’s okay to weigh yourself occasionally to see progress, but do not make it the ultimate basis of your success. I’ve had clients tell me stories of their previous weight loss attempts.  They were in a hurry to lose weight so they tried extreme diets just to get instant results.  Initially, they lost the weight but regained it back after some time. Then they changed their mindsets and focused on the process.  They found the right balance by giving importance to energy management, which made them lose the extra weight gradually. They got stronger, improved their relationship with food, really felt better, and sustained the new lifestyle. You can strongly affect the people around you with your vibrance and positivity. People will remember you for the type of energy that you give, how you make them feel, and not how you think you look. These are the questions that I always ask myself: Did I eat the right amount today so my body can function 100 percent again the next day? If I lack food, will eat more for dinner. If I eat more than my usual intake, then I will have extra energy the next day to lift a heavier weight or to add extra cardio. Did I exercise well today? I make sure that I always have the right amount workouts to make me stronger, not to bring my energy. If I pushed too hard, then inc rase my food intake, sleep more, and regulate my exercise load the next day. Did I get enough sleep? If I lack sleep, I usually take afternoon naps and  I don’t push myself hard with my workout classes. I try to make sure that I sleep early. Here are ways how to effectively manage your physical, emotional, and mental energy so you can resolve your weight issues and be at your best self every single day: Manage yourself Being aware of yourself, and what you truly need and want at this moment can bring you closer to your goals and give you faster results. Manage your thoughts and emotions Take every opportunity each day to recognize and use your strengths. Stop making excuses and just act on your goals. Do not wait for tomorrow. There are so many things that you can do in one day to improve yourself.  Every second counts. Don’t waste your time and energy. There may have been tough times in your life when you just feel like giving up. If this happens again, just ask for some time to breathe and recover. Then reset. Life is short, you don’t have a choice right now but to move forward, how fast or how soon, it’s all up to you. Life is always changing, growing, and evolving, and so are you. Thinking too much about what you cannot have, and what you cannot do will just drain your energy. Do your best to improve with what you can and what you have right now. A positive attitude adds more to your energy.  If there’s a slim chance to exercise in a nice studio due to financial constraints or because of the COVID-19 situation worldwide, then look around your house and see where you can exercise. When the pandemic began, I immediately thought of ways to continue my active lifestyle and work out at the same time.  I never thought the Zoom workouts with clients will give me enough energy.  I have clients who also achieved their best health and strongest by exercising at home. They didn’t complain, they just renewed their mindset of maximizing what they have at the moment, not allowing the pandemic to shatter their dreams of achieving their best health. Actually, fewer distractions will enable you to concentrate more on your goals.  This just proves that you don’t need to spend so much just to achieve a healthy lifestyle. In fact, the most sustainable workouts are the cheapest ones. Manage your support system Never hesitate to ask her and support from others who can lessen your burden. Your relationship with your loved ones can significantly affect your overall energy. You might always have the best intentions of improving your lifestyle, but if the people around you won’t cooperate, your repeated efforts might lead to stress. Communicate with people who greatly affect your energy.  Inform your loved ones how important your goals are and how these can positively affect your relationship with them. Then discuss how you can help each other to pursue your health goals as a team. Learn how to distribute tasks at home so you can have more time for yourself to pursue your healthy lifestyle tasks like preparing meals, exercising, and making time for relaxation. Surround yourself with positive people. Ask for help from a trusted workout buddy or a lifestyle or fitness coach. Stay away from negative people who just drain your energy over time and distract you from achieving your goals.

Watsons encourages customers to make a difference by limiting their carbon footprint,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/409207/watsons-encourages-customers-to-make-a-difference-by-limiting-their-carbon-footprint/,"01:00 PM June 28, 2022","In 2021, A.S. Watson reiterated its commitment to reduce the  environmental impact of its business and announced new targets to accelerate its contribution to the fight against climate change. For its first face-to-face sustainability event dubbed “Do Good for the Planet,” Watsons Philippines invited guests who talked about how reducing your carbon footprint is a way of doing good for the planet.  “Watsons recognizes its customers to choose more sustainable products and a greener lifestyle. We are continuing this sustainability journey and we are making it personal by talking about how we can reduce our own individual carbon footprint,” said Watsons Public Relations and Sustainability Director Viki Encarnacion. Carbon footprint refers to the total amount of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, generated by our actions. It is our total impact on the planet and how it contributes to global warming. Among the activities that increase our carbon footprint are travel, energy consumption, eating and shopping habits. For “Do Good for the Planet,” Watsons invited Jack Warren of ClimatePartner, social and mindful entrepreneur Rizza Lana Sebastian  and Cat Trivino of Communities for Organized Resource Allocation  to help media guests understand what carbon footprint is and why we should always be mindful.  ClimatePartner is a global solutions partner that works with corporate and individual customers to calculate and reduce carbon emissions and offset unabated emissions. “To address the issue of climate change, we should not emit more carbon dioxide than what we can offset, a state that’s called carbon neutrality. You can reduce your carbon emissions by eating more greens instead of meat, smart use of electricity, walk, bike or carpool and  fly economy instead of business or first class,“  said Warren.  Sebastian and Trivino gave media guests tips on how to reduce our impact on the environment. They both talked about the different ways in which we could go green, like choosing locally produced food and products, bringing your own bag when shopping and buying energy efficient products such as appliances with inverter technology. During the Watsons event, media guests were encouraged to calculate their carbon  footprint by logging on to ClimatePartner’s website, and they were able to see the sources of their carbon dioxide emissions.  “This discussion is a reminder that we can all help to minimize our carbon footprint  and contribute to the efforts to make our planet cleaner, healthier and safer,” said Encarnacion. The Watsons sustainability program encourages customers to do good for the planet by choosing products with better ingredients, going for product refills whenever possible, opting for clean beauty products and picking products that come in better packaging so they can be reused. Watsons has over 1,200 Sustainable Choices products in its 900+ stores nationwide and online channel For more information about Watsons’ sustainability program, go to Watsons Sustainable Choices & follow Watsons on Facebook, @WatsonsPH on Instagram and @watsonsphilippines on Tiktok.

Choose to embrace love,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/408576/choose-to-embrace-love/,"07:30 PM June 21, 2022","“The natural healing force within each of us is the greatest force in getting well.” —Hippocrates Let’s talk about love this June, the most popular marrying month of the year. Summer brings a time of relaxation and vacation mode for many, so it’s not surprising that June is one of the most popular times to tie the knot. June brides were more popular then, but now, December has become the preferred month to marry since the weather is cooler and family and friends come home for the holidays, as well. In my family, June is our top choice. My incredible parents, Alex and Marixi Prieto, got married 61 years ago on June 17. June 18 is the wedding anniversary of my son, Bryan Prieto, and his awesome wife, Tinkay Crespo-Prieto. They celebrated their fourth milestone yesterday with their closest friends. And on June 24, it would have been our 28th wedding anniversary. Among the friends of Bryan and Tinkay, longtime partners Mon Dinglasan and Maan Del Carmen finally celebrated their union in breathtaking Lagen Island, El Nido in Palawan. In a Filipino-inspired, environmentally sustainable and intimate setting, Mon and Maan wed on June 4, after the COVID surge last January postponed their wedding. The couple chose local suppliers from Palawan (videographer Mike Guayco Films, photographer Studio Fotogold and Miko De Jesus, hair and makeup by Angelou Lalican). Cha Andrada Events, in partnership with El Nido Resorts, planned and dressed up their beautiful beach wedding. Maan walked down the aisle in her Kat Corpus piña dress, carefully hand-embroidered with seashells, and her bridal party wore breezy tailor-fit long dresses from Tantease in blush, sage and silver gray tones. Mon wore a powder blue suit by Jayjay Reyes from New Hampshire Tailor Place Haberdashery. The four-day event was truly magical and definitely one for the books! On the other side of the globe, Tim Ng and Camille Tantoco held an intimate wedding celebration in Las Vegas. My fave couple, Donnie and Crickette Tantoco, was so delighted to celebrate their daughter’s milestone with just family and a few friends. June is indeed a month of love, and as I continue my healing journey, I still choose to embrace love. This past week, my attention was diverted to self-love, compassion, healing and release during a three-day healing retreat with Tina Baron of Buhay Retreats. In 2019, Tina commenced offering wellness and holistic retreats for self-growth and awareness, offering various self-care rituals such as yoga, sound and scents sessions and curated treatments. Her first Buhay Retreat was in the beautiful beach of Salaya located in Dauin, Negros Oriental. Lead by Bry Reyes and Shiela Matias of Rocket Yoga Philippines, the session included movement, sharing, art, good food and good vibes, with snorkeling with turtles in Apo Island. On her invitation, I attended the latest Buhay Retreat at The Venta Suites (@theventasuites on Instagram). Tina helped nourish our spirit, mind and body through body flows and movement, journaling exercises, sound and scents treatments, moon bathing, and heartfelt and insightful sharing among us participants. Held during a full moon, the retreat was illuminated with the energy of endless possibilities. Prior to the moon bathing, thunder and lighting and strong rain fell but completely cleared the skies. The cofacilitator was licensed medical practitioner Luna Marie M. Garcia RN, CBP, a quantum energy physician. With an educational background in biology, nursing and medicine, she began her alternative healing journey in 2017 when she earned her certifications in microcurrent point stimulation therapy for chronic pain management and scar release, BodyTalk, BodyTalk Access and Mindscape. Her healing modalities are also complemented by pranic healing, Reiki, Millennium Method, therapeutic essential oils and first aid homeopathy. A natural healer, Luna uses her medical training and intuitive skills to identify the root causes of mental and health concerns. She uses Western and Eastern techniques when healing. The combination of ancient wisdom and modern technology makes her unique. Apart from Tina’s and Luna’s sessions, I enjoyed my first crystal singing bowls session with Rachel Jamiro. (Follow @RachelJamiro, @hushangelsnaturals, @soundsofsunlight on Instagram.) A lawyer and philosopher by training, her love of learning has led her to study different sound and energy healing modalities such as quantum alchemy crystal bowl sound healing, gong therapy, aromatherapy, vibrational raindrop technique, color lights therapy, vibrational auricular technique, biofield tuning, angelic healing, seraphim blueprint and Reiki. Rachel is driven by her desire to empower others to pursue a life of passion and abundance. Among the wealth of wisdom and inspiration gained, I took home a sense of greater purpose and focus on my Big Picture that is increasingly authentic and empowering. I am more grounded and ready to head strongly to my Point B. And between all these journey points, I am joyful in the company of new and old friends. For the birthday of dear friend Anton Barretto, we dined and wined in Pardon My French (10 Jupiter St., Bel-Air, Makati; tel. 0917-8230091), the newest entertainment spot in Makati. It brings dining and live music back to Manila’s social scene. Enjoy an evening out with friends and be entertained by local musical talents. Each night, a different band takes center stage, so days of the week go from having jazz, to Latin, to disco, blues and beyond. Pardon My French is outfitted with a professionally designed stage and sound system, which will no doubt have you tripping the light fantastic. Trust me, life is always a celebration. Go and live it!

Increase in sudden adult deaths baffles experts,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/408762/increase-in-sudden-adult-deaths-baffles-experts/,"05:08 PM June 20, 2022","(Conclusion) T wo weeks ago, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) sounded the alarm about the increase in sudden deaths which they labeled as SADS (sudden adult death syndrome). This prompted them to develop the country’s first SADS registry to find out how serious the problem is, what’s causing it, and how it could be prevented. They didn’t attribute it to the anti-COVID vaccination, but a few observers noted that it’s difficult to disregard it as a possible cause. The phenomenon was described as a “mysterious syndrome that has left Australian doctors searching for answers.”According to an official statement of the RACGP, SADS usually occurs in apparently healthy adults under 40 years of age, wherein no definite cause could be established even after autopsy or postmortem examination. Cardiologist and researcher Dr. Elizabeth Paratz from the Melbourne’s Baker Heart Institute explained that these unfortunate victims had the cardiac arrest “with no cause found on the back end.” There is none of the typical blockages of the heart arteries, or death of the heart muscles (infarction) which may be expected in those who have sudden cardiac arrest. The most logical explanation is that the heart developed potentially fatal irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) which could lead to sudden arrest. Dr. Paratz echoed the dilemma of her international colleagues about SADS remaining a diagnostic challenge because the majority of these SADS deaths—around 90 percent—occur outside the hospital, and the victims don’t reach the hospital alive. They’re proclaimed DOA (dead on arrival). So, only around 10 percent reach the hospital emergency room and could have a fighting chance to survive. “We only see the tip of the iceberg ourselves,” said Dr. Paratz in a media interview.She explained it’s different when one dies suddenly due to a heart attack. “If someone has a heart attack and you do an autopsy, you might see a big clot—that’s a positive finding—but when someone’s had one of these SADS events, the heart is pristine (normal),” she said. “It’s really hard to know what to do.”Because most of the SADS victims are apparently healthy adults, and they die without reaching the hospital, the available data is still sparse. Based on this limited data, these asymptomatic and seemingly healthy adults, who may be predisposed to have a SADS event, may be identified by the following: a family history of a SADS diagnosis or sudden unexplained death of a family member, fainting (syncope) or seizure during exercise, or when excited or startled, and on-and-off palpitations. These palpitations may precede the fainting spells. According to the Australian data, more than 50 percent of the 4,000 annual SADS deaths in the country have shown one of these warning risk factors or signs.So one must have a high index of suspicion. The problem is that usually the symptoms are trivialized and attributed to something else. We had one young professional in his 30s who had occasional feelings of faintness and giddiness, which he thought was just due to fatigue and lack of sleep. Fortunately, he was at a mall quite close to a hospital, when he had his cardiac arrest, and another shopper nearby knew how to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The alarming increase in SADS cases in many countries highlights the importance of CPR as a basic skill everyone must learn. You’ll never know when you can play angel to someone who develops sudden cardiac arrest. It might be a loved one at home, an officemate at work or a complete stranger you encounter anywhere. The Philippine Heart Association conducts free CPR workshops for those who are interested (tel. 0917-3172031). A very similar SADS phenomenon has also been observed in other countries but it may just be called by another name. In Europe, it’s called sudden arrhythmic death syndrome. Here, researchers from the Concerned Doctors and Citizens of the Philippines (CDC Ph) have also reported an unexplainable incidence of excess deaths including sudden cardiac death, which was observed to have coincided with the vaccine rollout. No one can say for sure if it’s vaccine-related, but it warrants a more thorough study, which the government must initiate. Dismissing these excess deaths outright as simply COVID-related may deprive potential victims the benefit of being forewarned. We reiterate that it may be too premature to link these sudden deaths to the vaccines, but if our health experts keep on conveniently ignoring it without doing a thorough investigation, then there’s no way we can stem the alarming trend. The phenomenon has actually been observed even in seniors and elderly, who were previously doing well and stable on treatment, but suddenly deteriorating rapidly and dying within a few weeks. This really warrants thorough study. During the huddle with the Post Pandemic Med Help volunteers, Dr. Edward Tordesillas, who’s one of the pioneers of the family medicine specialty in the country, shared his cases of “long COVID,” which he attributed to anti-COVID vaccination. This was also raised in other forums by CDC Ph experts including Doctors Marivic Villa, Homer Lim, Benigno Agbayani Jr., Jade del Mundo and Romeo Quijano. Long COVID is usually diagnosed in patients who get infected with the virus, and still manifest the symptoms (easy fatigability, shortness of breath, weakness and lack of energy) more than three months after the infection. The CDC Ph experts believe that it may also possibly result from the vaccination. This is attributed to the spike proteins generated with vaccination which may damage the lining of arteries all over the body. Again, we don’t want to be accused of fear-mongering. But the public has a right to know that such possibilities, though said to be rare, actually exist, and may lead to serious disabilities or death in a small number of unfortunate vaccine recipients. We have consistently advocated even before the rollout of vaccination last year that vaccination should be promoted but NOT be made mandatory. At most, it should only be made mandatory to those who really stand to benefit from it, namely the elderly and immunocompromised. For the low-risk population, which most children, teenagers and healthy adults are, vaccination should only be administered voluntarily, after one is informed in detail on the benefits and potential side effects including rare deaths. We don’t understand why COVID vaccines, which are still considered experimental drug products, should be considered an exception. Disregarding the public’s will and personal informed choice is against the precepts of true public health service.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Give your dad an unforgettable wellness travel experience,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/406407/give-your-dad-an-unforgettable-wellness-travel-experience/,"03:41 PM June 16, 2022","According to the Global Wellness Summit (an international organization that shapes the future of the global wellness industry by bringing leaders and visionaries together), wellness travel is one of the biggest wellness trends this year. A wellness-focused trip aims to improve one’s overall health and well-being. Healthy lifestyle habits such as managing stress, eating healthy, and moving more can still be continued while people are away from home. I used to travel regularly with my husband before the pandemic to unwind, try various cuisines and witness different cultures. We would always include physical activities such as hiking, climbing mountains, running, and hotel workouts as part of our travel agenda. A couple of weeks ago, we went to Bicol with my dad and my father-in-law to give them a well-deserved vacation and wellness travel experience. It was one whole week of family bonding and active travel, to celebrate Father’s Day in advance as well. I believe that at this point in time, especially after years of being stuck at home during the pandemic, they prefer experiences like traveling with the family over material things. I am sharing my recent travel escapades to give you tips and ideas on how you can plan and give your loved ones a wellness trip that will positively engage their senses. Wellness travel is a great opportunity to bond with your loved ones while improving everyone’s mental, physical, social, and emotional well-being. Preparing a wellness trip Make sure that your travel preference can match your companions’ taste so the whole group can surely enjoy the trip. Our dads are very simple, and easy to please and they usually trust our choices when it comes to travel. They prefer a combination of adventurous and relaxing experiences in new and interesting places so they can share their stories and photos with their friends and family. Do not be too impulsive when it comes to traveling so you can avoid expensive airline tickets and resorts or hotels. Last Christmas, we already discussed the possibility of going to Bicol this year. I booked airline tickets two months in advance to avail of a cheaper rate. Give some time to research your desired travel destination so you can strategically plan the sequence of your trip. I usually give time to ask for suggestions from my friends and clients and check online articles, travel blogs, YouTube, and Google Maps at least a month before the trip. A well-planned vacation can help you save time, energy, and money during the actual trip. Discuss with your family the concept of a wellness trip – staying active while exploring new places, relaxing the mind, and enjoying good food. My husband and I have always packed light, ever since and we wanted our dads to experience an action-packed trip in Bicol.  So we asked them to pack light and bring extra clothes needed for physical activities such as water sports and light hiking. You can schedule a stress-free vacation during the last few days of your vacation as a well-deserved reward after the action-packed part of the trip. Traveling from one place to another can also be stressful. We had to transfer to three different places in Sorsogon, so I decided to include a luxurious resort experience in Albay during the last part of our trip. A few days before the trip, share your complete itinerary with the group – so they can still research the place and at least know what to expect and know what type of clothes to bring. I shared our final itinerary with our dads a couple of days before the trip and it made them more excited and physically and mentally ready when we met them at the airport. The adventure-filled wellness escape Create a wellness vacation based on your lifestyle, travel preferences, travel companions, and goals while applying the major aspects of wellness (physical, social, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual) to make it more meaningful. We stayed in Gubat, Sorsogon during the first three days of our trip. We stayed at Lacsa Hilton Beach Resort, a simple accommodation along Rizal beach. My husband, Armand managed to do a 5km run twice and some bodyweight exercises one morning for strength training. Before heading to Matnog, Sorsogon, we went to Bigaho Island and Eco-Park in Prieto Diaz. We did a short hike to Bigaho Island using the bamboo bridge.  We also did a side trip to Bulusan lake to take some photos of the magnificent view of the lake and the volcano (the volcano that just recently erupted exactly a week after our visit). Then we had an overnight stay in Casa Tente Boutique Hotel near Matnog Port and we did long hours of night swimming as a family. The next morning, we bought seafood and vegetables in the public market of Matnog port before heading straight to the most talked-about Subic Beach. The boat brought us to Juan Lagoon for a quick fish-feeding and to Calintaan cave for an hour of swimming, as part of the island-hopping adventure tour. We had an overnight stay in Dulay’s place and cooked our own food and had one memorable night of family bonding once again. The first part of our trip to Bicol was filled with adventure and activities that are very emotionally enriching.  Exercising, moving from one place to another, and briefly adjusting to new locations could be stressful, but witnessing the excitement of our dads in facing new experiences and places really made our hearts full. A luxurious wellness travel experience Schedule the most relaxing experience at the end of your trip to experience the rewards of a comfortable resort stay, impeccable service, sumptuous food, calm ambiance and picturesque views.  From Matnog Sorsogon, we traveled two hours to Misibis Bay in Cagraray Island.  I’ve been to this place a number of times already.  In fact, we had our very first out-of-town wellness retreat here. I also brought my whole family here one year before my mom passed away which happened 10 years ago and became our last trip as a whole family.  So beautiful memories came back when we visited the place. As soon as we arrived at the newly renovated  Misibis Bay Resort, we had a short nap, then we went straight to the gym to burn the extra calories we had from our buffet lunch in Waway’s Legazpi. The next day, I conducted a special morning Zoom cardio and strength workout class with my clients. Thanks to Zoom, I can now do workout classes even while on a trip. We ordered again Bicolano foods for dinner and ended the night with Videoke. The next day, we did so numerous physical activities such as gym workouts, walking around the resort, kayaking, paddle boarding, and swimming. We also had a very impressive and unforgettable outdoor dining experience on our last day. Of course, we ordered our favorite laing and Bicol express. Exploring the city Before you end your trip, while there is still time, do not miss the chance of exploring some of the most popular attractions of your destination, eat the most popular foods and buy your pasalubong foods. From Misibis Bay, we traveled for about an hour to Hotel St Ellis in Legazpi City, where we spent our final night. Our stay in this hotel was very memorable because we had an open forum as a group and I truly felt that the bond between the group became stronger than ever. I was still able to walk and run around Legazpi Boulevard while seeing the majestic Mayon Volcano and passed by some famous Legazpi City attractions such as Embarcadero de Legaspi, Sleeping Lion Hill and Sawangan Park. We spent the rest of the day in the City visiting the market to buy pili nuts and other unique Bicol pasalubong. Then we went to SM City to eat Bicolano dinner in 1st Colonial Grill serving the most authentic Bicol viands and the most popular Sili ice cream. We left Legazpi the next day. I felt so happy and fulfilled because I was able to share a part of myself with my family during the whole trip. Our dads went to new places, tried something for the very first time, did some activities they haven’t done for a long time, and enjoyed the beauty of nature once again stimulating their senses, reminding them of their past, and giving them more motivation to take care of their health, mind, and body so they can still enjoy life to the fullest with their loved ones. I can’t wait for the next family wellness travel adventure. Email the author at [email protected] or follow her on Instagram @mitchfelipemendoza    CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Dental veneers and cosmetic enhancements: The game changers,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/405307/dental-veneers-and-cosmetic-enhancements-the-game-changers/,"05:46 PM June 10, 2022","Valeria Doctors' founder and President, Dr. Patricia Diana Suiza talks about elevating the practice, and embracing advancements to offer the very highest levels of Dentistry and Aesthetic Medicine to their patients.  Smile is considered as the best accessory one can wear, but nowadays, having a  beautiful, healthy smile is already considered a lifestyle. Smiling is an important part of  life, not only as a way to express our emotions but also as a way to build relationships and make lasting first impressions. Thankfully, modern technology has resulted in plenty  of solutions for people who find themselves lacking confidence in their smiles. With so much information we can access freely now, it can be hard to understand what  your treatment options are, which one is the best for you, and how the procedure will  affect you in the years to come.  Enter Valeria Doctors—a serene medical and dental haven that ethically offers treatments  and procedures for both General and Cosmetic Dentistry and Face and Body Medical  Aesthetics. Located in the more laidback area of Pasig, the clinic is a tranquil space away  from hustle and bustle of modern life.  “It was my initiative. For years, I was operating two dental clinics located in the eastern  part of the metro. And because of their proximity to each other, I have been getting the  same clientele for both clinics,” recalls Valeria Doctors’ founder and seasoned dental  practitioner, Dr. Patricia Diana Suiza. Through the years, her client base has  tremendously grown, with patients coming in from as far as Baguio, and even OFWs who  learned about her and her practice from write-ups, personal referrals and testimonials  found online.  Considering that her husband, Dr. Lieth Momani is a licensed and certified Cosmetic  Surgeon and that they also owned an aesthetic clinic, Doc Tricia thought of a way to  better serve their patients. “I realized I want to step up and redefine the landscape of the  practice. I want to focus on delivering “premium” services, to change people’s perception  on Dentistry and Medical Aesthetics and to emerge as a game changer in the industry.  My experience in having to handle several clinics since 2013 has taught me that the key to stand out is to find my passion and back it up with furthering my skillset through  continuous learning and experience. Years ago, I thought it was in surgery I was  passionate about until one day, I figured that it is in “beauty” that I get the most “kilig”. I  also had to go out of my way to support this idea by taking up entrepreneurial courses,  hiring business coaches and finding doctor mentors. Deep inside I knew I can do more,  give more and be more. So I always dare to be extra”. I want Valeria be a household name in this specific medical field. I want to be a household  name in the field of creating the most beautiful and the healthiest smiles ” shares ‘Doc  Tricia,’ as she is fondly called by peers in the industry. When you say ‘veneers’ I want my name to be the first to get a mention.” Doc Tricia is a  good industry player—possessing the brains, the skills, the attitude and sophistication.  Indeed, she’s up to being the Queen in her field. The “Queen of Veneers” as her patients  would call her. Dr. Lieth Momani on the other hand is a rising superstar in the field of Cosmetic Surgery.  With his impeccable skills and carefully developed techniques; being known known for  his scarless surgeries, Dr. Momani is that other essential chord in a harmonious practice  collaboration.  Backstory, just when that dream of Doc Tricia was about to rollout, COVID-19 hit and  ground the whole world to a halt. “But that didn’t stop me and my husband from that  dream. We just had to put it on the back-burner.” Two years into the pandemic with  lockdowns easing out and countries slowly opening, Doc Tricia approached her longtime  friend and industry colleague, Dr. Brian Punzal, and asked him to join in 2021. Doc Brian  also practices Cosmetic Dentistry and is known for his expertise on Oral Surgery. “I  always want to work with people whose values are aligned with mine but who can  neutralize my being aggressive and he is just the best fit to join us”. Together with Doc  Tricia and Doc Lieth, Doc Brian makes up the founding three of Valeria Doctors—a one stop clinic that can provide and perform treatments and aesthetic procedures that can  enhance a patient’s physical and mental well-being from head to toe. Valeria Doctors: A multidisciplinary clinic that banks on providing quality treatments,  thoroughness in diagnosis and excellent patient experience is what they always aim to  sustain. A premium reputation anchored on the desire to make the world more beautiful  one patient at a time. This places Valeria Doctors uniquely and acutely at the forefront of  the latest training, and product information when it comes to cosmetic dentistry and facial  and body aesthetics. It has dental suites, private treatment rooms, a room for diagnostic  imaging, medical doctor’s office and other specialized areas.  A bit of a trivia: Valeria Doctors got its name from Doc Tricia and Doc Lieth’s daughter,  Lietrice Valeria. Valeria in Latin means strong, brave, and healthy, which fits with the core  values of the company. “It also feels more personal by naming it after a real person,” says  Doc Tricia. Every single aspect of Valeria Doctors is different. The entire staff embodies the vision of  the company. When asked what patients should look for in a medical establishment if  they want to avail any dental treatments or aesthetic procedures, Doc Tricia answered,  “licensed and trained dental/medical practitioners are a must,” she first pointed out. These  practitioners have undertaken extensive training, enabling them to deliver only the very best results. Secondly, excellent sanitation and sterilization protocols from the clinic down  to the smallest medical instruments. Third, machines, equipments esp LASERs should  pass international safety standards. In a practice like ours, investing on good brands of  equipments, products and materials is non negotiable”. She also emphasized thorough  consultation, clinical examination, and diagnosis before proceeding should be among the  criteria for choosing the right clinic. She also mentioned transparency regarding  limitations of procedures, excellent client and after-care services, and lastly reasonable  charging. “Price should always be based on the skills of the practitioner performing the  procedure,” she states. “Price of services is a subjective matter and we define it based  on the value we, as doctors put into our work and the quality of the results we deliver”. For Doc Tricia, health should be the first. Functionality comes second, and Aesthetics  should be the last consideration when it comes to the practice. “For me, the aesthetics  part is the easiest aspect. Making sure that we have a healthy foundation and ensuring  functional restorations are the tricky parts. It is the health and function that will determine  the longevity and success of the treatment. Aesthetics is the superficial aspect and the  easiest to alter”.

Overcoming the self-inflicted pressure to be a prodigy,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/405306/overcoming-the-self-inflicted-pressure-to-be-a-prodigy/,"02:41 PM June 10, 2022","I don’t remember when or why I wanted to become the best. I’ve come to believe that that’s just how my brain was programmed from the start. The idea of my name with a shiny, bright No. 1 next to it put a smile on my face. The standardized tests, the successful competitions, the stack of As on my report card, and the red stamped stars on the back of my hand satisfied my little 6-year-old brain. After all, who doesn’t enjoy succeeding? From then on, I just wanted to keep winning. As they say, sky’s the limit. The goal was to be the smartest person ever. (Sky’s the limit, remember?) Think naming and knowing the locations of all of the countries in the world, mentally solving any math problem thrown at you, understanding every molecular process happening in your surroundings, being fluent in 12 languages—I desired to be a prodigy, like those whiz kids in the advertisements. It was more fascinating the younger you were, so the pressure I put onto myself to do great things at the young age of 9 was like carrying 10 elephants on my pinkie finger. An unrealistic standard, it really was. Over the years, I felt like a failure for never doing anything even a fraction as groundbreaking as people who were years and degrees ahead of me. Can you imagine a 12-year-old feeling frustrated because they haven’t found the cure to Alzheimer’s disease yet? What once was the source of my drive and ambition became a sort of self-sabotage mechanism. I was thankful for my desire to be great, it was my fuel to keep going and to keep achieving, but almost all things come double faceted. Despite me being at my best, I was convincing myself that everything I had been doing wasn’t enough. It was a weird mix of guilt, disappointment, anger and envy. I felt guilty and disappointed that I wasn’t doing enough, I was angry that I wasn’t good enough, and I envied those who I wanted to become. I beat myself up for every score that I didn’t deem satisfactory, revising past tests and checking what I could have done differently. There were times when I couldn’t even look at my own papers; I felt it was too embarrassing. Sixth grade, undoubtedly the lowest point in my pressure-to-be-great pipeline, was cut short by the pandemic. Days that turned into weeks that turned into months, were spent indoors with no academic pressure whatsoever. I spent a long time trying to keep myself entertained while in lockdown, revisiting old hobbies, falling back in love with things that used to hold special places in my heart, learning new things about the world, and about myself. With the time I spent alone, I have discovered healthier means of continuous goal-achieving. I started playing the guitar again, I rekindled my passion for writing, and found a delightful escape in reading. And as school rolled back around, I had accepted that I wasn’t always going to be the best, and that it was perfectly OK if I wasn’t. My pure, unmitigated love for learning has returned, and the great scores and awards I receive are merely reminders for me to keep loving it.

Queen Elizabeth II kicks off historic jubilee celebrations,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/404755/queen-elizabeth-ii-kicks-off-historic-jubilee-celebrations/,"02:21 PM June 03, 2022","by Martine PAUWELS / Phil HAZLEWOOD / Valentine GRAVELEAU Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday kicked off the first of four days of celebrations marking her record-breaking 70 years on the throne, to cheering crowds of tens of thousands of people. But the 96-year-old sovereign’s appearance at the Platinum Jubilee — a milestone never previously reached by a British monarch — took its toll, forcing her to pull out of a planned church service on Friday. “The queen greatly enjoyed today’s birthday parade and flypast but did experience some discomfort,” Buckingham Palace said. “Taking into account the journey and activity required to participate in tomorrow’s national service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral, Her Majesty with great reluctance has concluded that she will not attend.” The extent of the queen’s participation in the historic jubilee had already been in doubt due to her difficulties walking and standing, and a recent bout of Covid. But dressed in dove blue, her hands clasped on a walking stick, she appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony to take a salute after the centuries-old Trooping the Colour military parade. After gun salutes and a fly-past of military aircraft, she made a second appearance on the balcony with three generations of her heirs, princes Charles, William, and George, and other close family members. In bright sunshine, The Mall below was awash with red, white, and blue union flags, with some die-hard royal fans camping for days to be in prime position for the display of pomp and pageantry. But many acknowledged the coming end of an era in what some feel could be the last major public event of her long reign. “We know it’s a special occasion because it might be the last day we’ll see Her Majesty in a public event,” ambulance service worker Gilbert Falconer, 65, told AFP after travelling from Scotland.  Recognition of the queen’s unprecedented reign saw tributes from political and religious leaders from across the world, including Pope Francis and US President Joe Biden. Even the leader of pro-Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland Michelle O’Neill praised the queen’s “significant” contribution to the peace process. O’Neill’s letter would have been unthinkable before the 1998 peace deal that ended years of violence over British rule. Sinn Fein was the political wing of the Irish Republican Army paramilitary group, which blew up the queen’s cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, in 1979. The queen, a keen horsewoman, has previously taken the salute in person at Horse Guards Parade, the site a short ride down The Mall where King Henry VIII once jousted. But her 73-year-old son and heir Prince Charles stepped in this year, in the latest public sign of his future role as king. Joining him at the parade of the color or regimental flag of the 1st Battalion Irish Guards was his sister Princess Anne, 71, and his eldest son, Prince William, 39, both in ceremonial uniform. Senior royals watching on included Charles’ younger son, Prince Harry, and his wife Meghan, on a rare visit from California. They kept a low profile while the queen’s disgraced second son, Prince Andrew, 62, was not seen and will also miss Friday’s service after contracting Covid. The queen was at Windsor Castle, west of London, on Thursday night for a ceremony to light the principal beacon of more than 3,000 across Britain and the Commonwealth of 54 nations that she heads. Elizabeth was a 25-year-old princess when she succeeded her father King George VI in 1952, bringing a rare touch of glamour to a battered nation recovering from World War II. Seventy years on, she is now the only monarch most Britons have ever known, and an enduring figurehead through often troubled times. Britain’s first and very likely only Platinum Jubilee will see street parties, pop concerts, and parades until Sunday and a huge public pageant involving 6,000 performers. On Wednesday the Queen thanked everyone involved in organizing community events in Britain and around the world and said she was “inspired by the goodwill” shown to her. “I… hope that the coming days will provide an opportunity to reflect on all that has been achieved during the last 70 years, as we look to the future with confidence and enthusiasm,” she added.  The jubilee, held against a backdrop of rising inflation that has left many Britons struggling, is being seen not just as respite for the public after two years hit by Covid, as well as world events. But it was also a welcome return to normality for the royals. Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, caused shockwaves in early 2020 by moving to North America, from where they have publicly criticised royal life. In April last year, the queen lost her husband of 73 years, Prince Philip, and was forced to sit alone at his funeral due to coronavirus restrictions. Since then, her health has declined and she has faced the reputational fallout for the monarchy from Andrew’s links to the convicted sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Andrew, who in February settled a US civil claim for sexual assault, has effectively been fired from his royal duties.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
How you can help advance your childs IQ and EQ with DHA and MFGM Pro,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/403608/how-you-can-help-advance-your-childs-iq-and-eq-with-dha-and-mfgm-pro/,"04:05 PM May 20, 2022","A child’s chance for future success relies not just on harnessing the IQ. It is also very much dependent on making sure his or her EQ is equally developed. EQ is the ability to understand, use, and manage one’s own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. It is how a child is able to keep calm when a favorite toy is lost or when he or she can’t figure out the answer to what 8+5 is. It is how a child is able to get along with other kids while in play or in school. It is how he or she is able to manage  frustration without throwing a  tantrum. Completing your child’s EQ to have these attitudes will help set them up for success in the future. With recent studies that point to the importance of EQ as part of a child’s holistic growth, moms who have been  focusing on IQ are now nurturing the EQ abilities of their kids. Apart from concentrating on their kids’ mental strength in the areas of  logic, memory and language, moms have also started to hone their kids’  confidence, behavioral regulation and independence. That’s because moms now know that  if they don’t enhance their kids’ EQ, a child is basically #MissingHalf of what is necessary to attain success in the future. Fortunately, there’s now a reliable way for moms to #CompleteTheMissingHalf of their kids’ intelligence development by giving them Enfagrow A+ Four Nurapro which is scientifically proven to develop not just IQ but also EQ.  Enfagrow A+ Four Nurapro’s formula has a game changing combination MFGM Pro and superior DHA levels* (versus other premium milk brands), plus prebiotic blend of HMO and FOS. MFGM or Milk Fat Globule Membrane has been scientifically proven to enhance a child’s EQ by providing healthy doses of Sphingomyelin and gangliosides to aid in brain formation; and, Sterols to help regulate hormones that help in cognitive functions. Plus, it has DHA- an omega-3 fatty acid proven to be essential for IQ and brain development during early childhood, to promote bone growth, and to strengthen the body’s immune system. Combined with proper nutrition and stimulation, Enfagrow A+ Four Nurapro completes the #Missing Half by providing kids 3 years old and up with proper nourishment that equally enhances both IQ and  EQ.  By giving their children Enfagrow A+ Four Nurapro,  not only do moms get a competitive value of their money because of the unbeatable combination of MFGM Pro and superior DHA levels*, they also  become Moms for Great Minds as they proactively help their kids’ EQ  development towards future success.

5 crazy societal expectations we need to rethink,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/403602/5-crazy-societal-expectations-we-need-to-rethink/,"03:03 PM May 20, 2022"," Are you one to stutter in the face of high expectations from society, others and even yourself? No worries, I assure you that you aren’t alone. On the one hand, we need expectations. Expectations assure us that we won’t live a mediocre life and remind us that we ought to use our talents and gifts for a purpose. Expectations to be loving parents, knowledgeable teachers, empathetic employers and hardworking employees all help keep society afloat. On the other hand, though, we also are human, not robots. We have our limitations. Below is a list of what I believe are five societal expectations that we need to reconsider. Philippine society no doubt demands a lot from us. Filipinos love to celebrate big events. Many of us want to get married in the future—including myself—but it can be incredibly pressuring. I’ve been to many big weddings and there would be hundreds of people, a crazy amount of flowers, lovely decor and so much glamour. I’m not necessarily against that but we also ought to be open to those who just want simple weddings. Smaller weddings would be much less costly, could be more intimate, and thus, a thousand times more memorable. There would also be less pressure on the bride and groom, something they’d surely appreciate. This is a very toxic mindset. Boys are human beings just like girls are. Human beings have emotions. Human beings face problems in life. But when boys experience depressive days and/or problems, they’re simply told to just “man up.” We ought to normalize boys having bad days, too. We ought to normalize them being able to comfortably talk about their problems. We ought to understand them, knowing that they, too, need help at times. They, too, need love and support. They, too, need tenderness, as “unmanly” and “privileged” as that sounds. Let’s put an end to toxic masculinity. As a practicing Catholic, I believe that the openness to procreation is a fundamentally crucial component to marriage and to sex, which is the marital act. Why? Because love (in all contexts!) cannot be contained—it’s so powerful that it cannot just be bottled up. We know that. And sometimes, within sex, love even has the power to bring new life. However, the older practice of having five to 10 children per family is, I believe, no longer prudent for many. Back in the 1960s perhaps, a middle-class family could have seven children, with only the father working, and survive just fine. If a middle-class family were to do that now, they’d find themselves below the poverty line. It’s time that we normalize both openness to procreation and being prudent with family planning. Let’s normalize giving children a healthy and happy life. We experience bad days. We ought to normalize that bad days are a reality, and when we have those bad days, we ought to take things a little slower. This ought to move us not necessarily to get rid of our duties in life, but to at least be more empathetic. A little empathy will never hurt! Everyone knows what Metro Manila was like prepandemic: We spent hours and hours in traffic. The pandemic, as bad as it has been, taught us that many things in our school and work can be done online. There’s no need to require students to come to school for a 15-point true-or-false quiz; that can be done online and asynchronously. There’s no need to require employees to report to the office if they can finish their reports independently at home using Google Docs. Please, I implore administrators and employers reading this, let us not just blindly go back to the prepandemic norm. Let us create truly effective systems and setups in school and in the workplace. Efficiency is key. Creativity is also key. Maybe then we won’t find ourselves complaining about traffic every day, just on some days! These are just five of what I believe are crazy societal expectations we Filipinos face. I’m sure that there are more. I think the key is to just be more empathetic and less judgmental. Exercising empathy and being less judgmental would make our lives a billion times better and happier. —CONTRIBUTED The author is pursuing a master’s degree in Catholic Studies at the Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio.

The most effective exercises for your unique body type,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/403563/can-you-still-reshape-your-body-the-most-effective-exercises-for-your-unique-body-type/,"01:48 PM May 20, 2022","Your body type is determined by your genes, but current studies show that you can still modify the expression of your genes with environmental and lifestyle changes. You cannot change your body frame or structure right now, but you can still reshape your body through exercise so you can lose your overall body fat and build muscles on your desired body parts. What workouts are effective for your body type- long duration cardio, sprints, heavyweight training, high-repetition strength workouts using light weights, Pilates, or yoga?  Seven years ago, I became one of the researchers for a weight management program study for a pharmaceutical company. We used a genetic test kit for the subjects to identify the best exercise and nutrition plan based on their genetic makeup. I was tested as well and I found out that my body responds well to vigorous-intensity exercises and I have more slow-twitch muscle fibers, which means that my body is more efficient in doing long duration cardio workouts – this explained why I performed well in doing long-distance running like marathons in the past.  Though I’ve been focusing more on light to moderate resistance training since the start of the pandemic, my body still looks for run training, so I make it a point to do a 50 to 70-minute run at least once a week because it makes me feel good, knowing that my body is still efficient in doing moderate to fast sustained cardio workouts.  When it comes to resistance training, my genetic profile indicates that my body will benefit more from doing high repetitions (12 to 20 repetitions) of lighter loads of resistance, focusing more on muscular endurance with shorter rest periods in between sets and this has been my main type of workout since the start of the pandemic.  My body responds well to endurance-based resistance training when it comes to improving functional strength, toning, and body reshaping.  My personal experience shows that our strengths and weaknesses in a particular fitness activity or sports are based on the muscle fibers that predominate the body – fats of slow-twitch).  Even without the genetic test, you can try to recall your exercise history and consider your current level of performance when it comes to cardio and strength. Do you excel more in doing long sustained cardio workouts or sprints (fast-twitch muscle fibers)? Is your body more responsive to low repetitions of heavier weights or doing high repetitions of light to moderate weights?   Are you an ectomorph, mesomorph, endomorph, or a combination of two body types?   Regardless of your body type, you can still reshape your body by controlling your food intake and by doing the most appropriate workout that can match your current goals, fitness level, health condition, age and lifestyle  Through the years, I’ve seen different body types and shapes of clients. I’ve witnessed how someone can improve his/her body shape with consistent exercise and a controlled way of eating. These are some things you should consider and exercise strategies you should do to achieve your body goals.  You can still achieve a muscular physique, regardless of your body type. Mesomorphs and endomorphs can build muscles easily. Ectomorphs need to exert extra effort and time for weight training, nutrition and recovery to be muscles effectively. Studies show engaging in a resistance training program that uses heavier weights with multiple sets and less repetitions is effective in building mass.  The selection of strength exercises should match one’s body shape and goals.   Cardio workouts using compound movements like squats and shoulder presses with light weights or high reps (12 or more reps) and multiple sets of bodyweight exercises like lunges alternating with push-ups can help burn more calories since your heart rate is up the whole time. High repetitions of various exercise move even with light to moderate weights can sculpt the body without the bulk, especially when combined with cardio exercises. This exercise type is good for people who want to see more muscle definition. Ectomorphs and Ecto-mesomorphs should work harder by lifting moderate to heavier weights more frequently to achieve more muscle tone while doing this type of exercise.  Endomorphs and pure mesomorphs can see faster results even with light weights with this type of training when combined with cardio workouts.  Pilates uses slow and controlled moves with fewer repetitions to focus on improving one’s posture.  It is designed to strengthen the core while also strengthening the major muscles of the body. It is important to consider improving your posture to be more efficient in executing your regular exercise and avoid injuries.  You cannot change the structure of your spine, but you can strengthen the weaker muscles around your torso like the lower back, waist, and abdominals.  If you have a lordotic or arched back, focus more on strengthening your abdominals, obliques, buttocks, and hamstrings to avoid lower back pain. If you have a kyphotic (round or hunch back) posture, you need to strengthen your back shoulders, and upper back.  The workout can also lengthen and tone your body, especially when combined with full-body strength training and cardio. You can work your entire core during the whole session of Pilates,  but there’s no such thing as spot reduction.  A smaller waist and flatter tummy can only be achieved by burning more fat around the body by doing cardio exercises, a more intense strength training routine, and practicing a consistently healthy diet.  Yoga poses are designed to improve one’s flexibility, balance, and overall strength.  You can build muscles by doing and holding the yoga poses such as chaturanga for the upper body and warrior poses for the lower body. I took the Ashtanga yoga course before the pandemic and I really noticed how my upper body and core improved in terms of tone and strength after numerous practice sessions. Holding each of the yoga poses can improve one’s flexibility while stimulating a lot of muscle fibers. Isometric contraction is engaging your muscles without movements such as holding a plank position for a few seconds, which can strengthen your upper body and core strength. As you continue with the practice, you will be trying more challenging poses, which can lead to building more strength and improving your muscle tone.

AlphaMom’s guide to raising fast-thinking AlphaKids,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/402979/alphamoms-guide-to-raising-fast-thinking-alphakids/,"06:06 PM May 12, 2022","Promil Gold Four explains the golden window of opportunity and how AlphaMoms can use this period to unlock their AlphaKid’s fast thinking skills AlphaMoms want only the best for their children. Because they want their children to grow smart, confident, and independent, they willingly invest in the best products, opportunities, and experiences. To help more #AlphaMoms unlock their AlphaKid’s fast-thinking skills, Promil Gold Four recently hosted an online event called Fast Thinking Unlocked: Raising an AlphaKid. In the webinar, child and family expert and educator, Dr. Gail Galang, discussed the important period of a child’s development called the Golden Window of Opportunity.   According to Dr. Galang, the first five years of a child’s life present a Golden Window of Opportunity. “This period is when 90% of brain connections are formed, and optimal development occurs. In addition, this stage is when at least 1 million brain connections are made every second — more than at any other period in one’s life,” she explained. To support children’s brain nutrition, they need phospholipids for brain development. These are found in α-Lipids (Alpha-Lipids), a unique, brain-boosting ingredient in Promil Gold Four. “Since becoming a mom, I’ve become even more discerning about products for the family. We research about what we can give them and we take time to find things out,” shares AlphaMom Isabelle Daza. “Right now, we’re lucky we have resources available. You can learn almost everything online, you can consult with experts. For us, I made sure to do some research before Baltie started drinking Promil Gold Four. I know that DHA is not enough, and it’s really great that Promil Gold Four has such a superior formulation to promote faster brain connections.”  “I agree! I’ve always been very science-based and everything has to be factual. After learning about the Golden Window of Opportunity I realized that I have to take advantage of this period so I need to know what maximizing the first five years looks like. I hope that as the children grow, I become a more informed, more experienced AlphaMom.” echoed fellow AlphaMom, Georgina Wilson.   In addition to providing optimal brain nutrition, Dr. Galang recommended regular and healthy mental stimulation and encouragement. “Every moment can be an opportunity to develop fast thinking skills,” shares Dr. Galang.  “Everything we do—from learning how to read and write, move, process our feelings, and relate with others— is powered by how our brain forms connections in each of those experiences.” Dr. Galang also reminded parents how it is important to monitor progress. “These days, there are many ways to track the progress of your children. Parents can use journals, and even learning tools to see if they are on track in their cognitive development.” In true #AlphaMom fashion, Belle and Georgina ensure that their young children enjoy various activities to help them learn and think of new ideas. “There’s really nothing like the way the kids’ faces light up when they’re excited about a fresh new idea,” shares Georgina. “It’s amazing how they’re not only like sponges but they know how to process information and even offer really great insights,” adds Belle. With the help of reliable partners like health care providers, child development experts, and superior products like Promil Gold Four, more #AlphaMoms like Georgina and Belle can raise fast thinking, independent, and confident young children. The Golden Window of Opportunity is crucial to a young child’s development, and that’s why mothers who want the best for their children should invest in the best products, like Promil Gold Four.

Face-to-face sports classes: Where to enroll kids this summer,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/402128/face-to-face-sports-classes-where-to-enroll-kids-this-summer/,"07:28 PM May 02, 2022"," Depending on one’s comfort level, fully vaccinated children 5 years old and above now have more options to join face-to-face athletic enrichment classes this summer to hone their talents and skills. My 11-year-old Jack and 6-year-old Juno were doing jiujitsu drills via online classes with Jits For Kids, but inconsistently, since they would tire of the limitations of the format. Since they’ve been fully vaccinated and are used to wearing masks, they’ve been playing outside with the neighborhood kids and are eager to enlarge their social circles. Hybrid classes are in the offing when school starts for them again in July, so what better way to ease into the anxieties of recirculating than through some fun in-person classes this summer. Jack and Juno enrolled at Deftac Alabang’s kids’ jiujitsu classes, led by brown belts Mark Cupino and Arthur Mori. Classes are on Wednesdays (4 p.m. to 5 p.m.) and Saturdays (3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.) at the No Ego Studio in Alabang Country Club (P4,800/month). What to expect: The studio is indoors but well ventilated with high ceilings. Both coaches do not wear masks and the participants have the option to wear masks or not. Majority of the children wore masks, including my kids. Jiujitsu is a close-contact sport, so they felt safer being masked up. Aqualogic Swim Co. (aqualogicswim.com) teaches swimming to babies as young as 6 months old, children with autism, to adults. Rates are between P7,970 to P18,000 for eight sessions with a P1,000 annual registration fee. They hold classes at The Village Sports Club in BF Homes Parañaque, New World Hotel Makati, Edsa Shangri-la Hotel and Shangri-la Fort Bonifacio. What to expect: Teacher-student ratio is 1:4. Classes run for 30 minutes for babies, 45 minutes for toddlers, and one hour for older children. Futbol Funatics (futbolfunatics.com) runs camps all year in Cavite, Parañaque, Alabang, Makati, Taguig, Pasig, Quezon City and Cebu. Rates are P700/session, with a P1,500 uniform fee. What to expect: It is recommended for beginners and for those who play for fun. Training is done on the field. Fortis Football Academy runs classes at the Pacific Malayan basketball court in Alabang, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 4 p.m. It is led by Philippine football leaguer Ryan Fermin. Rates are P400/session, P3,500/10 sessions and P6,500/20 sessions. What to expect: Smaller group than at other football clubs. Technical exercises are taken seriously, but coaches don’t shout at kids when they make mistakes. There is more focus on fundamentals, their touches instead of kicks. There is a bit of running in an open field. Arayat Football Club specializes in three age groups. Under 7 and Under 11 trains at 3 p.m. daily, while the Under 13 class runs at 4 p.m., all at Cuenca Park, except Fridays at the country club (both in Alabang). Rates are per session, monthly or for three months. Free trial class available. Contact coach Medhi Soltani (0917-7661738). What to expect: Teaching style is reportedly more intense, so this club is recommended for more serious players. Training is done on the field, rain or shine, year-round.  Learn and Train Sports Academy (learnandtrainsports.com) offers Artistic Gymnastics for all ages. A member club of the Gymnastics Association of the Philippines, it claims to be the only fully equipped gym in Makati City, located on Don Bosco Street. First-time class rate is P500 for toddlers and P800 for beginners/ninjas. Class packs (four, eight, 12, 20 sessions and unlimited) can be purchased with rates ranging from P5,600 to P22,000. Visit learnandtrainsports.com for more details. What to expect: The coaches wear masks but follow the World Health Organization recommendation for kids who are doing strenuous activity, which is to remove their masks if they choose to. The gym is not air-conditioned. They don’t require children 17 and below to be vaccinated but they require all adults entering their facility to be fully vaccinated. —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Confused about fats? Here’s how to manage your fat intake,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/401857/confused-about-fats-heres-how-to-manage-your-fat-intake/,"12:20 PM April 28, 2022","Dietary fats play a big role in energy, metabolism, and cardiovascular health while giving us fullness and satisfaction when combined with good carbohydrates and proteins. However, too much consumption of fats can cause imbalance and weight gain, which can negatively affect one’s health. Misconceptions about the fat that can be read in numerous articles and fad diet books can lead to confusion when it comes to achieving healthy and balanced eating. Here are ways how to choose the right type of fats (by knowing what’s healthy and unhealthy), how much to consume (based on the recommended guidelines), and how to incorporate them into your lifestyle so you can achieve your health, weight, and fitness goals. First of all, you need to know the difference between good and bad fats. Good fats contribute to improving one’s health such as effectively absorbing the vitamins from foods while lowering the bad cholesterol (LDL) and increasing the good cholesterol (HDL). These are unsaturated fats (liquid at room temperature)–polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats that are found in oily fish, nuts, seeds, avocado, and plant-based oils. Saturated fats (solid at room temperature) and trans fats (natural and artificial) are unhealthy or bad fats, which should be eaten sparingly to avoid heart problems. Foods high in saturated fats are mostly animal products such as butter, cheese, meat, cake, cream, and milk chocolate. If possible, fully avoid artificial trans fats (hydrogen is added to the oil to = partially hydrogenated fats) found in commercial sweet products, crackers, deep-fried foods, fast-food French fries, and frozen foods because they can attack your health by increasing the cholesterol levels (especially the LDL that can lead to stroke and heart attack. But excessive consumption of good and/or bad fast can still result in weight gain. Fat contains more than twice as many calories as proteins and carbohydrates. It is important to know how to manage servings of foods high in fat.    Email the author at [email protected] or follow her on Instagram @mitchfelipemendoza  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Enabling the disabled through dance,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/401696/enabling-the-disabled-through-dance/,"06:49 PM April 25, 2022","Mentor and choreographer Brezhnev Larlar never knew he was born with kidney failure until later in life. He was too busy enjoying his scholarship at the Australian Ballet School and careers in Ballet Philippines and “Miss Saigon” in London, and running his own dance company in Cavite. His ailment was triggered in the aughts when he taught in a school in Makati. The pressure from students who were gung-ho international dance competitors and stage parents who demanded lead roles and solos for their daughters took its toll on his health. “I wanted to develop future artists for the Philippines, but the studio became a factory for robots. I faced many anxieties,” he recalls. Larlar has since undergone several surgeries—a gall bladder removal and an emergency catheter in the neck for a hemodialysis. When he was diagnosed with kidney failure, a fistula was grafted into the arm for his regular dialysis. Although Larlar has been teaching, albeit virtually, throughout the pandemic, his movements are restricted. While undergoing dialysis on the clinic bed, Larlar would make graceful movements with his head, legs and feet. His limbs would sway rhythmically to the sounds of the dialysis machine and its alarm. The nurses would be amused. As a person with disability (PWD), Larlar believes that dance offers infinite possibilities to anybody regardless of their physical limitations. Recently, he relaunched the Danceability class via Zoom to cater to everybody. Even before the pandemic, the live Danceability classes attracted a diverse range of students—regular people with no dance training; the deaf-mute; the blind, the crippled; patients with Parkinson’s disease, Down syndrome, autism, polio and cancer in the advanced stage; amputees; and dancers undergoing teacher training. Danceability was developed by Italian American choreographer Alito Alessi, whose mother was bound to a wheelchair and who had a sister with polio. While teaching modern dance to little children, he saw how movements boosted their self-esteem and improved their ability to communicate. Alessi then created a dance company that defied disability stereotypes in 1987. In 2013, he conducted a Danceability teachers’ workshop at the Cultural Center of the Philippines, participated in by Larlar. The term “danceability” is a reproach to the word “disability,” which tends to isolate PWDs. Believing in inclusivity, Alessi defined “danceability” as a study of movement improvisation for all types of people. The final objective in each session is to create a sense of community amid the diversity. He believes that people’s physical or mental conditions are not problems but opportunities for learning. Normal people can learn from the disabled, and vice versa. It doesn’t matter if the student doesn’t understand or hear the verbal instructions, as long as one explores space. Danceability is not therapy. The intention is not to change the person but to foster acceptance of everybody as he or she is. It enables the person to use any part of the body to express emotion. Danceability is based on the principles of feeling the sensations in the body; relationships with dance partners based on nonverbal communications; how timing influences movement changes; making the performance space accessible to everyone; and providing equal opportunities to all. The session begins in silence, in deference to people who can’t hear or speak. As in any improvisation session, there is no preplanning of steps or choreography. However, the improvisation is governed by the rules developed by Alexis: action and reaction or being aware of one person’s movement and responding to it; following the lead; dancing in pairs or groups to assure that everyone is learning something, whether they are lying on hospital beds or hanging onto a crutch; using touch to communicate; and variations of themes in movement. People will interpret the terms or instructions differently. If the instruction is to jump, a normal person would spring from the floor, while a PWD would just lift an arm or finger. Stillness, a basic term in Danceability’s vocabulary, is usually rendered as freezing like a statue. For people with Parkinson’s disease or cerebral palsy, stillness would mean staying in one place even if the body does involuntary movements. A normal person would interpret fast by running or skipping, while a PWD would crawl. “This isn’t the kind of dance wherein the body is pushed to the extremes. There are no right or wrong moves,” adds Larlar. Alessi’s vision is to create performances in streets or public spaces to show society that PWDs can be as expressive as dancers. Larlar recalled that when he joined Alessi’s workshop, he was touched by the sharing of the PWDs. They forgot about their disabilities when they moved freely in the same space with dancers and movers. Before the pandemic, Larlar’s two-hour Danceability classes invariably ended with a studio performance, where mall-goers could watch through the studio’s glass wall. In one performance, the normal students forgot their steps, but those with Down syndrome knew their cues and became the dance leaders instead. The revived Danceability class focuses on body awareness, using body parts to express an emotion and producing sounds with gestures. The deaf-mute, on the other hand, “makes sounds” through sign language. He hopes that when the virtual community grows, Larlar can hold onsite rehearsals and produce shows. Walking his talk, Larlar meditates and executes movements on his own especially when he’s undergoing dialysis. “Ninety minutes fly by so fast because I apply what I’ve learned when I move my head, arms and feet. When I need to boost my adrenaline, Danceability is the antistressor. It has kept me positive.” —CONTRIBUTED Danceability Philippines and Teatro Baile de Cavite: tel. 0956-9133584; email [email protected]  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022

Ever since her crowning as Miss Universe 2015, Pia has cemented her status as a sought-after model, brand ambassador, actress, and podcast host, among many other titles. This multifaceted woman is showing no signs of stopping this 2022, with numerous projects already under her belt (and maybe some even in the works). What Has Kept Pia Busy Lately? On top of releasing new episodes for the podcast “Just Us, Queens,” Pia and her longtime friends and co-hosts Bianca Guidotti and Carla Lizardo launched The Queens, a website dedicated to being a safe space for their listeners and more last January. The trio also published “The Queens Digital Workbook” designed to empower listeners and guide them in their journey toward self-discovery.   A post shared by Pia Wurtzbach (@piawurtzbach)  She also wrapped up filming for “My Papa Pi,” a new comedy series alongside Piolo Pascual, now airing on the Kapamilya Channel, A2Z, TFC, iWantTFC, and other platforms.   A post shared by Pia Wurtzbach (@piawurtzbach)  Most recently, she launched her very own food business called Pia’s World Kitchen that effortlessly combines her love for food and travel and allows her to utilize her culinary knowledge with a menu that changes every three months. Speaking of travels, Pia’s also recently been on wanderlust-inducing trips to the UAE, Scotland, and Switzerland – as evidenced by her gorgeous photos.   A post shared by Pia Wurtzbach (@piawurtzbach)  Despite her busy schedule, Pia manages to maintain a healthy lifestyle by consistently working out no matter where she is in the world. Sometimes, she hits the gym with her just-as-fit Dubai-based boyfriend Jeremy Jauncey to power up their day.   A post shared by Jeremy Jauncey (@jeremyjauncey)  How Does Pia Manage to Stay on Top of Things? Pia’s schedule may look daunting, but she remains not just confidently beautiful, but also remains on top of things while facing challenges with ease with the help of Iron + Folic Acid + B-Complex (Hemarate® FA), the most doctor-prescribed iron supplement for Filipinos. Having low amounts of iron in your body can negatively affect your blood health and make you prone to iron deficiency anemia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2019, global anemia prevalence was 29.9% in women ages 15-49, equivalent to over half a billion women. Unfortunately, this occurs more often among women like Pia who lead a very active lifestyle and experience monthly periods. These activities cause women to overwork their bodies leading to experiencing hilo, putla, or lata, all signs that your iron levels are running alarmingly low which can lead to iron deficiency anemia. Together with a proper diet and exercise, Iron + Folic Acid + B-Complex (Hemarate® FA) may help reduce your risk for iron deficiency anemia. Hemarate® FA has 60mg of elemental iron, the recommended dose for Filipinos. By taking the right amount of elemental iron, you are able to address these symptoms of iron deficiency like hilo, putla, and lata and maintain good blood health to allow you to do and achieve more. Iron + Folic Acid + B-Complex (Hemarate® FA) is best taken orally once a day, or as prescribed by your doctor.

TRENDING NOW: The renaissance of the anti-filter,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/400427/trending-now-the-renaissance-of-the-anti-filter/,"06:17 PM April 07, 2022","In a society that has become so reliant on public validation, views, and likes, the anti-filter TikTok trend serves as antithesis to the usual. Set to Twenty-One Pilots’ hit song “Tear in My Heart”, the video starts as the person sings along with a heavy beauty filter or a full face of make-up on. Then, as the lyric “But my taste in music is your face” plays, it transitions into them showing off a bare face or a more natural look. Captivating hundreds and thousands of the platform’s users, TikTok superstar Charli D’Amelio join in on the fun herself, sharing the video with her nine million followers.  The conversation around transparency on social media has seen a drastic rise over the years. A concept initially designed to be humorous, filters have now taken on a life of their own and evolved into what we know now: A quick fix to smoothen skin texture, an easy solution to enhance one’s nose, or maybe even a cheeky solution to a bloated face. Needless to say, the use of filters and other appearance-enhancing apps, has taken a large toll on many individuals’ body image. In a Harvard School Of Public Health interview  last year, Professor Bryn Austin stated, “From experimental research, we know that Instagram, with its algorithmically-driven feeds of content tailored to each user’s engagement patterns, can draw vulnerable teens into a dangerous spiral of negative social comparison and hook them onto unrealistic ideals of appearance and body size and shape.”  We may still have a very long way to go, it’s safe to say that this trend may be pointing us in the right direction.  Actress Ashley Tisdale tried out the trend and praised it for being “healthy” and “cute.” It is a unique way to embrace one’s self when stripped away from all the make-up and styled hair. Hopefully, this TikTok trend continues or at least helps us build healthier viewpoints as we play with our front-facing cameras.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Decline in brain function can begin as early as age 45,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/400223/decline-in-brain-function-can-begin-as-early-as-age-45/,"07:45 PM April 04, 2022","A 72-year-old long-time patient of ours complained recently of increasing forgetfulness, which seemed to be getting worse over time. It started with remembering names. He couldn’t remember names of new acquaintances, so he had to write them down and read the names on the list from time to time so he could remember them. Then many times, he would be put in an embarrassing situation when there would be a lag of a few seconds before he could remember the names of even relatives and longtime friends. Finding things he has misplaced is a regular challenge to the entire household—car keys, reading glasses, wallet, pill box and envelopes of newly withdrawn cash from the bank. He can still clearly remember memories of his childhood—the complete name of his best friend in elementary and the places they frequented, his favorite teacher in school and what he liked about her, the first day he wore long pants—but he has difficulty remembering what he had for dinner the previous day or what he and his friend discussed on the phone recently. His long-term memory was still very good, but his short-term memory not as well. Otherwise, he still functions normally. He drives his daughters to work, does the groceries, and plays cards and mahjong very well. “Am I developing Alzheimer’s disease?” he asked us. He seemed to be more worried about it than his clogged heart arteries, which cause his heart to go into heart failure from time to time. “No, it doesn’t look like you have Alzheimer’s,” we assured him, “but you do have signs of cognitive or mental decline, which at your age and with all the cardiovascular risk factors you have—hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol and previous history of smoking—is still par for the course.” So an age-related deterioration in the brain’s functions and capacity is not necessarily equivalent to Alzheimer’s disease. Although it’s ideal to closely monitor these patients, since mild cognitive impairment (MCI) could be a transition zone between age-related mental function deterioration and Alzheimer’s disease. Our brain’s various mental functions subtly decline with age. Some experts tell us that the brain’s capacity for memory, reasoning and comprehension skills—all of which are labeled as cognitive function—can actually start to decline from age 45, or at least, much earlier than the age of 60 or 70, as previously thought. In his extensive review of literature published several years ago in the Neurobiology of Aging Journal, Dr. Timothy Salthouse and his group from the Department of Psychology, University of Virginia, USA, showed that cross-sectional comparisons from 18 to 60 years of age have consistently revealed that as one ages, there are associated decreasing levels of cognitive performance, which seem to accelerate in some as early as 45 years of age. The general assertions before Dr. Salthouse’s publication was that cognitive decline occurred later in life. According to Aartsen et al., “Cognitive decline may begin after midlife, but most often occurs at higher ages (70 or higher).” Albert and Heaton wrote that “… relatively little decline in performance occurs until people are about 50 years old.” Plasman, et al., believed that “cognitive abilities generally remain stable throughout adult life until around age 60.” Ronnlund et al. wrote in their thesis that “no or little drop in performance (occur) before age 55 …” Schaie et al., asserted that “most abilities tend to peak in early midlife, plateau until the late 50s or 60s, and then show decline, initially at a slow pace, but accelerating as the late 70s are reached.” Although Dr. Salthouse’s findings have been challenged by other authors and researchers, we believe he could be correct with this assumption. The reason there may be some age-cognitive function discrepancy in other studies is that the decline in memory and other mental skills may be masked by the increase in experience, insights, and possibly enhanced grace and confidence that also come with age. Theoretically, the brain cells may be deteriorating as one ages, but this is more than compensated for by what one has gained in his or her more vast experience in life and the wisdom that comes with it. This is the reason why some claim that one’s most productive years are between the ages of 55 and 75. A justice of the Supreme Court nearing the retirement age of 70 may no longer remember all the details of a case, but his or her erudition of the law, experience-based wisdom and good judgment are more important traits in the dispensation of justice. A practicing physician in his late 70s may no longer know the details of how a new drug works in the body, but his so-called “clinical eye” is sharper than ever and can intuitively make him discern what might be ailing the patient the moment he or she walks in. An elderly scientist may not fare as well as his colleagues 30 years his junior in memory skills, but he would rate higher in analytical or other so-called higher-learning skills. So, when should one worry about one’s deteriorating memory? When can we say it’s not only age-related, and still par for the course for those with high blood pressure, diabetes and other risk factors? There’s reason to worry if the decline in memory and other mental functions already interferes with one’s work. In the case of our patient, he’s still perfectly functional and able to do most of the things he’s supposed to do. He just needs to be a little more organized in the way he does things, like leaving his car keys, wallets, reading glasses, etc. in the same place so he knows exactly where to get them when he needs them; regularly writing down notes in his journal of the things he did, and people he met; writing on Post-Its important appointments and instructions; and other simple means to assist his failing memory. It’s true that initially, it may be difficult to distinguish the memory loss pattern of age-related mental decline from Alzheimer’s disease. Only the short-term memory may also be affected in early Alzheimer’s disease, and their long-term memory may still be intact, which is pretty much the same in age-related memory decline. When we say there’s already Alzheimer’s disease or other types of dementia, it already indicates a more serious brain problem that interferes with one’s ability to think, understand, communicate, interact with others and perform activities of daily living. There is usually a deterioration in most if not all mental processes such as thinking, reasoning, learning, problem solving, memory, language and speech. Because of the interference in one’s behavioral interactions, one’s ability to navigate social functions is also seriously impaired in dementia. Although it may present very mildly at the start, just like any age-related memory decline, Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia are generally rapidly progressive and may soon be accompanied by behavioral and personality changes. In short, one with Alzheimer’s or dementia can no longer function well, and may no longer be able to take care of oneself. He or she has to be assisted. Why is it important to realize that significant mental function decline can occur as early as 45 years of age? All interventions now at preventing mental decline, whether it’s lifestyle change (diet, physical and mental exercises) or pharmacological (brain-cell transmission enhancing drugs), are usually focused on people in their 60s or 70s. It might already be too late by then for some people because irreversible changes may have already happened in the brain. Interventions at prevention should be started much earlier, particularly in those with risk factors such as strong family history of dementia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (buildup of plaques in the arteries of the body), diabetes and hypertension, unhealthy lifestyle (diet rich in processed foods, sedentariness), smoking and excessive alcohol intake, obesity and obstructive sleep apnea. Many young adults already have several of these risk factors. The earlier control measures are started, the better the chances of mitigating the early decline in their mental function, and the better their chances of enjoying life to the fullest even in their sunset years.

Should we screen for colon cancer from age 45?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/399772/should-we-screen-for-colon-cancer-from-age-45/,"06:46 PM March 28, 2022","Over the last decade, there has been an increasing incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in persons younger than 50 (young-onset CRC) in the United States, especially among high-risk African Americans and Caucasians. CRC was in the spotlight in 2020 after “Black Panther” star Chadwick Boseman died from the disease at the young age of 43. CRC is a malignant tumor in the colon or rectum. The Global Cancer Observatory (Globocan) reports that CRC is the third most prevalent cancer in the world, with close to 2 million new cases annually. CRC also ranks as the third most common cancer in the Philippines, next to breast and lung cancers. In 2020, an estimated 17,364 new patients in the Philippines were reported to be diagnosed with colon and rectal cancer.Screening is the process of looking for cancer or precancerous lesions in people who have no symptoms of the disease. The high prevalence of CRC all over the world makes screening so much more important, as it is a preventable and screenable cancer. Screening for CRC is one of the most powerful tools in beating this cancer. Screening can diagnose this cancer early, when there is the best chance for cure. There are two major methods for screening: A colonoscopy is the gold standard, while the stool test—fecal immunochemical test (FIT)—looks for occult (unseen) blood coming from the colon. The latter test is the one typically used in established CRC population screening programs in the world. Almost all CRCs start as benign growths called polyps. A polyp may take as long as 10 years to develop into cancer. The advantage of using a colonoscopy for screening is that gastroenterologists can visualize and remove polyps before these turn into cancer. In almost all countries in the world, screening average-risk patients starts at age 50. Screening can save lives and has been shown to reduce the risk of CRC by as much as 70 percent, so that means seven out of 10 cases can be saved if detected early. Colon Cancer Awareness is a massive worldwide campaign for screening, which had its beginnings in the United States in 2000. After a decade, the Philippines joined this crusade, and The Medical City is among the pioneer institutions that promoted this advocacy. After extensive analysis, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) changed its recommendations to begin screening average-risk persons for CRC from age 50 to 45. The recommendation was based on systematic review and comparative modeling studies of more recent American patient data and the government’s capacity of their health-care resources to respond to these added needs. The body concluded with high certainty that screening for CRC in adults aged 50 to 75 years has substantial net benefit (recommendation A). In addition, the task force also concluded with moderate certainty that screening for CRC in adults aged 45 to 49 years has moderate net benefit (recommendation B). The applicability of these guidelines to Philippine patients remained unanswered. The Medical City, in collaboration with the Department of Health, organized a successful virtual symposium on CRC screening on March 4. I chaired the session as the lead for the institution’s Colon Cancer Screening Advocacy Program. The discussion of this USPSTF recommendation on the new screening age of 45 in the Philippine medical setting was among the highlights. The lecture “45 is the New 50 in CRC: How feasible is it in the Philippines?” was given by professor Jose Sollano, former president of the Philippine Society of Gastroenterology and the Philippine Society of Digestive Endoscopy. Do we automatically adopt these American guidelines, despite the big difference in genetics, environmental factors and national government resources? We cited that Americans, especially African Americans, are at a much higher risk of CRC than Filipinos, owing to their genetics, Western diet and lifestyle, like with obesity. Based on Globocan, the age standardized incidence rate for CRC in the United States is around 25.6 per 100,000, while that of the Philippines is 18.8 per 100,000. In addition, the Philippines is a low-resource country without even a national screening program for CRC. Sollano analyzed the Philippine data to answer whether age 45 should be accepted as the new recommendation for screening of average-risk Filipinos. However, he stressed that there is no data available yet in the Philippines that can demonstrate an increase in patients with young-onset CRC, unlike in Western medical literature. The screening guidelines of other Asia-Pacific countries are still recommending the start of screening at the age of 50. Moreover, some of these developed Asia-Pacific countries have already established their own CRC screening programs. The cost-effectivity of lowering the screening age has not yet been demonstrated in the East. In building a CRC screening program, the government and other stakeholders need data, infrastructure, personnel and funds. An efficient system of screening millions of Filipinos and the needed recall of those who tested positive with FIT must be in place in order for the program to be successful. Sollano also underscored that “there are only more than 500 board-certified gastroenterologists for 104 million Filipinos in the whole country.” Expanding the screening to include additional lower-aged patients will likely overwhelm the program and the medical professionals. “Without any data, infrastructure or funds from the national government, [it] may not yet be feasible in the Philippines,” Sollano concluded. —CONTRIBUTED The author is a consultant gastroenterologist at The Medical City and is the lead specialist in charge of the annual Colon Cancer Awareness activities of the hospital.

We can relax mad rush for mass jabs–for now,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/398574/we-can-relax-mad-rush-for-mass-jabs-for-now/,"01:55 PM March 25, 2022","(First of two parts) Patients have been asking us if they need to continue taking prophylactic medicines for COVID-19. As we’ve written in previous commentaries, we recommended and still recommend ivermectin both for prevention and treatment of the viral infection. However, Omicron has changed the rules of the ballgame. Since it’s relatively much milder than the Delta and the other variants, and with the current low positivity rate (low risk of getting infected), we have advised our patients to stop taking it regularly for prevention. We advise them, though, to keep some stocks of the drug, and to take it as early treatment should they develop any suspicious symptom of COVID-19. They have to contact their physicians for specific instructions how much to take and for how long. It should not be taken indiscriminately without doctor’s advice. For those at very high risk for infection, such as medical front-liners attending to COVID-19 patients, prophylactic treatment may still be recommended. The same may be advised for elderly and other immunocompromised individuals living with medical front-liners assigned to the COVID wards or emergency rooms. But for all the rest who are considered healthy—particularly children, adolescents, teenagers and young adults—the best immune protection is boosting one’s natural immunity with a healthy diet and lifestyle, adequate sleep and sunshine exposure, and natural immune-system boosting supplements. For us, mandating vaccination for these healthy sectors of the population, and possibly requiring it every three to six months, is ill-advised and tilts more to the potential harm side. We’ve been reiterating this in this space since March last year, and we believe this has become more tenable with the current Omicron variant. By all means, we believe the Department of Education can safely resume face-to-face schooling or its hybrid version without requiring vaccination for the students, provided standard health protocols are observed. We should already discard our super-paranoid attitude toward COVID-19. In several columns since February last year, we discussed how excessive fear and paranoia (victim’s mindset) can retard our recovery. We should have a victor’s mindset instead, and learn how we could coexist with the virus. Well, we received a few unkind comments for such “irresponsible” commentaries that could endanger the lives of so many, but when several countries like Singapore later announced a similar change in attitude towards the pandemic, we didn’t rub it in anymore, and just hoped our health officials would loosen a bit their extra-tight hold in their anti-pandemic response. We welcome the announcement of Health secretary Francisco Duque III that they’re already considering to downgrade further the alert level in Metro Manila and other areas to the lowest possible, and we hope that includes finally junking the vaccine pass, and hopefully the vaccine mandate, too. Several countries have already discarded vaccine mandates, either out of a late realization of its irrational basis or due to massive public pushback. For a while, some couldn’t help but get the impression that we were just mandating mass vaccination since we had a lot of near-expiring stocks of vaccines. We don’t think this was the real reason, but we’re also glad to hear Secretary Duque announcing the plans to donate our extra vaccines to low-income countries, which still need additional supply of vaccines to get a good portion of their population vaccinated. That’s better than trying to get these experimental vaccines unnecessarily into the arms of our people, especially our children and teenagers. We believe we can relax the mad rush for mass vaccination and boosting, at least for now. Some readers sent messages that our forecast made at the start of the Omicron surge again came true. We wrote that it would be like a roller-coaster ride for a quick three weeks but starting mid-February or early March, we could all heave a sigh of relief and say, “That was scary but a fun ride!” By the “fun” part, we meant that all of us who were exposed to Omicron already got free natural vaccination or boosting without us realizing it, and there’s no need to get a synthetic vaccine to boost our immune system. An Omicron infection would have given us the most updated version of immunity no amount of vaccination could give us. All current vaccines are actually based on the ancestor of Omicron—the original wild type virus from Wuhan. It’s like preferring to use the old Nokia cellular phones instead of the latest iPhone. Immunity from an Omicron infection gives us this immune “iPhone.” We believe we’ll get a lull from any COVID-19 surge in the next four to six months, and it would be a good opportunity to progressively but still cautiously open up the economy, and revive our domestic tourism by junking vaccine passes. Dr. Marivic Villa, a medical specialist based in Florida treating a lot of high-risk COVID-19 patients, posts pictures and videos showing that since six weeks ago, everything is back to normal in Florida and several other states. The mall parking lots are full; the queues to popular restaurants are like pre-pandemic; the pubs are alive with boisterous customers cheering and toasting. The number of new confirmed cases in the US per million population is still much higher than ours, but despite the relaxation of many of their health protocols, their cases still continue to go down. It’s now around 95 percent lower compared to its peak of more than 800,000 new cases daily in mid-January. Do you think it’s due to the mass vaccination? With all due respect, we don’t think that contributed significantly. It was more likely due to Omicron getting a good number of the population exposed and allowing them to develop a more robust, updated and longer-lasting immunity. We agree with many experts’ opinion that Omicron has achieved what no vaccination has achieved or could ever achieve. So again, we hope the government would reconsider halting mass vaccination and boosting for now, allowing the lower-risk sectors of the population, including schoolchildren, to get naturally exposed to the Omicron variant while we still have it. Why vaccinate against something which is almost just as mild as a seasonal flu, and can give one the immune protection against possibly deadlier variants later on? An Omicron infection can likely help prevent severe disease should another more infectious, hopefully not more virulent, variant come along during the latter part of the year.

A big blow to the ‘strongman’ myth,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/398484/a-big-blow-to-the-strongman-myth/,"12:57 PM March 25, 2022","“History proves that all dictatorships, all authoritarian forms of government are transient. Only democratic systems are not transient. Whatever the shortcomings, mankind has not devised anything superior.” —Vladimir Putin The above quote is probably from the distant past in Russian president Vladimir Putin’s life. But it’s not a one-off. Here are other eye-openers: “Nobody and nothing will stop Russia on the road to strengthening democracy and ensuring human rights and freedoms.” “There are both things in international law: The principle of territorial integrity and the right to self-determination.” Having said all that, he is now embroiled in an all-out invasion of an independent neighboring country which was formerly part of the now extinct Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) under Russian hegemony. There are varying opinions on who or what is ultimately responsible for this unprovoked attack on Ukraine which is costing many lives, crippling its economy, destroying its infrastructure and causing an overnight refugee exodus numbering in the millions. Many lay the blame squarely and solely on Putin, while others point to the United States and its Western allies, particularly the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which today counts former USSR countries among its members. I will not dwell on this complicated issue, which is a subject for political experts, but the fact remains that the situation is a potential powder keg, which this early is already impacting the rest of the world, at the very least economically. The main point of this piece is on a more personal level—how an originally democratically elected head of state evolved into an authoritarian “strongman” with practically no term limits and political constraints to his rule. In this case, as the leader of a military superpower, he has the capacity to wreak widespread havoc in the international community. Putin’s rise to power began when President Boris Yeltsin appointed him acting prime minister of the Russian Federation in 1999. He became acting president when Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, and subsequently won the presidential election in 2000. Since then, he has deftly held on to power by alternating between the presidency and the premiership and is now on his fourth presidential term (2018-2024). In 2024, he will again be eligible for two additional six-year terms based on an executive order inserted into the Russian Constitution, which became an official amendment in July 2020. With Putin virtually assured of a lifetime presidency, political experts no longer regard Russia as a democracy but an authoritarian state, citing the jailing and repression of political opponents, the intimidation and suppression of the free press, and the lack of free and fair elections. (Wikipedia) With his personal decision to mobilize Russia’s military might to invade Ukraine, Putin has put an exclamation point to his transformation from a democratically elected leader to an autocrat with absolute political power. As expected, the dire consequences of the ongoing invasion have not been limited to Ukraine, but now are being felt in its neighboring countries and globally, including here in our country—and most especially in Russia itself. Consider these:  Ukraine is being destroyed as a country—physically, economically, politically, socially and most fundamentally in terms of the daily lives of its citizens who are being killed, displaced, deprived of their livelihood and their heretofore normal existence; the situation will get worse if they become an occupied people without the freedoms they have known.  Ukraine’s neighbors (Poland, Hungary, Romania and others) will be overwhelmed by the influx of refugees growing into the millions as the war drags on. Fortunately, these countries have so far welcomed their displaced Ukrainian neighbors, but an unabated refugee influx can lead to another humanitarian crisis.  The Russian people themselves are already feeling the pinch of the widespread and varied sanctions increasingly imposed by the United States and its allies, including traditionally neutral countries such as Switzerland—the banning of Russian flights, the cancellation of existing business agreements, the termination of partnerships, the cutting of access to certain banks and financial services, the cancellation of sports and cultural events, the exclusion of Russia in international organizations (the list goes on). Most telling is the drastic loss of value of the Russian ruble, and its inevitable effect on the prices of goods for ordinary Russians. The growing international isolation and discrimination against Russians in various fields has prompted many of them to call on their government to cease its hostilities against Ukraine.  Globally, the continuous spikes in the prices of petroleum products are significantly affecting economies which are heavily dependent on oil imports (our country is among them). In addition to pump prices at record highs, consumers everywhere will have to deal with rising inflation.  The ongoing war also affects the international community’s sustained ability to address the critical issues facing humanity as a whole. According to respected historian Yuval Noah Harari in a recent TedTalk interview, the threat and insecurity being fostered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict have led governments to significantly increase their allocations for military preparedness (e.g., Germany has doubled its military budget overnight). In doing this, countries have to cut down on their projected allocations to address urgent worldwide problems such as global warming and climate change, pandemic response, international health and social services, environmental degradation, income inequality and the needed advancements in technology to address these challenges. In short, the prospect of wider military conflict and another possible Cold War is forcing governments to put more emphasis on national security. What is the world learning from all this? Aside from underscoring yet again that we now live in a global village where the fortunes of all countries are intertwined, a corollary important lesson is that the actions of individual leaders, especially authoritarians, can significantly impact this worldwide village we all live in. With little or no consultation, their decisions often don’t reflect the will or the best interests of their constituents, and since no one can oppose effectively, some actions can lead to disastrous consequences on a big scale. The bottom line: Authoritarian rule is not a viable system of governance and is transient, as Putin himself said in an apparently enlightened moment. Here in our country, we have been able to restore our lost liberties and the institutions of a working democracy after 14 years under a dictatorship. But recently, we have again elected a leader with a strong authoritarian bent. Today, we have another opportunity to elect a new leader totally free from the inclinations of a closet authoritarian or one who brings with him the vestiges and baggage of a former dictatorship. As I emphasized in a previous piece, a nation’s leader has the biggest role in determining the path and fortunes of his/her country, and can bring it to new heights or unprecedented depths. Let us not choose the latter.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Regine Tolentino on breastfeeding: ‘Not easy but truly fulfilling’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/399071/regine-tolentino-on-breastfeeding-not-easy-but-truly-fulfilling/,"08:16 PM March 20, 2022","Celebrity mom and entrepreneur Regine Tolentino cherishes having breastfed her youngest child, Rosie Rignee, and feels it is the best way to take care of her baby. Tolentino shared how fulfilled she is as a mom who breastfed her daughter for two years, as per her Instagram page last Friday, March 18, where she showed a series of photos of herself while breastfeeding. “As my baby @rosierignee turned [two] yesterday, I reached another milestone as a mother; breastfeeding my [third] child. It is quite a sacrifice mentally and physically to make this commitment, but I realized the greatest reward is the bond between mother and child,” she said. Tolentino believes it is best to have one’s child breastfed because it is the healthy way of nourishing. “They say breast milk is best for babies up to 2 years old, so I am happy I made it past this mark. It is also the best for me because there is nothing better than time spent nourishing my child,” she said.   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Regine Tolentino (@reginetolentino)  “Cheers to all breastfeeding mothers and motherhood!” she stressed. “It isn’t easy, but it is truly fulfilling.” Tolentino gave birth to Rosie Rignee in March 2020, after two decades of not being pregnant. She thus calls her daughter a “miracle baby” and gave birth to her through cesarean section.

The road to recovery,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/398986/the-road-to-recovery/,"05:17 PM March 19, 2022","The long road to recovery has been laid out for me: a six-month regimen of medication, exercise and diet—a reasonable one, I’m happily surprised—and I’m well on my way, off on a new beginning. Anyway, I tell myself, in Waldo Emerson’s words, “You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities, no doubt crept in. Forget them as soon as you can, tomorrow is a new day; begin it well, and serenely, with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense.” Perhaps, it’s only fair that things happened late for me. I battled with tardiness most of my life. I often arrived late for school, and later also for parties. The latter habit I developed with help from my first husband, a brain surgeon, who always seemed too tired for socials. We’d arrive late and leave early. Leaving early was harder for someone like me, who had to wait all day and dressed early, looking forward to being with friends. Perhaps life is getting back at me. I’m starting on a lifetime of health maintenance at 82. Some friends had a 15-year head start on me. When I said I was having a cataract operation, everyone had had theirs. Even my angioplasty, the repair I’m recovering from, seemed old hat to peers. But then, there’s no argument my case has been perfectly timed—with the amazing advances in medicine and technology. My timing, come to think of it, has somehow changed for the better with Vergel, a stickler for punctuality. Just watching him, I’ve learned the value of time and timing. It seems to have its providential rewards. A few years before the pandemic, I did something really smart—and fun, too—at the right time, on hindsight. I joined a small group of friends for a thrice-weekly aqua-aerobic exercise in Anabelle’s pool. Even during the pandemic, we did it between lockdowns. We’ve resumed it with some regularity, although, with my angioplasty, I have yet to rejoin. A generous, counterproductive breakfast follows each session, but the frank and intimate exchanges at table cancel it out: We friends have grown closer and wiser. They, never mind me, seem somehow to have found their own formula for not only coping but beating life’s never-ending challenges. I’m in continuous awe of their well-preserved mental sharpness and level of positive energy, which, I’m convinced, has its healing and inspiring qualities. We draw inner strength from one another, especially when anyone of us goes through a personal trial. We all feel so fortunate for one another’s company that we take out-of-town trips for further bonding, bringing along the two remaining living husbands, who themselves happen to be old friends from the same town. The departed husbands have their own part as subjects of sentimental conversations. In Anabelle’s husband’s particular case, he sometimes takes part physically, as a butterfly or a dragonfly fluttering around the pool. At any rate, to Annabelle, it’s definitely her Tom. Whenever the pandemic eased, Linda called a priest, a friend of hers, to celebrate Mass before the session. Afterwards, he himself joined us in the water and at breakfast. Thus, a spiritual component is added to the session, and no doubt it was part of the preparation for my cardiac procedure or other life’s surprises to come my way. I have no doubt, too, that my oldest son and my youngest granddaughter, brought to us by the pandemic and other circumstances, are themselves part of the providential arrangements: They have enlivened our home. For this, I’m eternally grateful to my life partner, whose depth of understanding and love, is nothing short of wondrous. It’s a blessed life, a far more blessed life than I deserve—but then, who am I to judge myself. As I set my own personal goals for recovery, I can’t help but think of the country’s own case, which certainly dwarfs mine. What would take six months for me to recover would surely take far longer, and that is yet depending on the outcome of the elections in May. The stakes have never been higher this time around. Vergel keeps telling me that, if the Marcos-Duterte partnership wins, we are finished. I believe him. But I also have faith. I wasn’t spared from a heart attack to live under another Marcos-Duterte regime! I mean to outlast this nightmare and be around for the final redemption of the Filipino soul. I have faith in God’s personal love for us. Why else have we been given a Leni and a Kiko and, with them, the chance to knock down for good, in just one election, two malevolent dynasties?

At the same time, she believes that she needs to be healthy for her to be fit to work. “Sobrang saya, sobrang blessed. Ang tagal namin itong hinintay and masaya ko na nandito ako ngayon.

"TO FAST OR NOT TO FAST? Finding the perfect meal timing based on your goals, body and lifestyle",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/398271/to-fast-or-not-to-fast-finding-the-perfect-meal-timing-based-on-your-goals-body-and-lifestyle/,"01:52 PM March 08, 2022","Creating eating habits that work best for you can be challenging if you’ve been reading so many articles about diets and weight loss. You’ve most likely also have seen success stories of people or photos on social media who lost weight because of drastic measures. I mentioned in my previous article that instead of thinking about losing weight the fastest way, you should focus on developing an action plan to function well and effectively. Remember that being out of balance can sabotage your weight management goals. You might be disregarding the most important aspects of your daily life that are needed to achieve balance so you can accomplish your goals for the day. These include incorporating exercise, eating a balanced meal, enjoying your meals with the whole family, and living life freely and generally without being too preoccupied with thoughts about dieting and food. Recent studies show that meal timing can affect one’s health condition and weight loss results. But can fasting work for you? To maintain long-term energy and weight management, we consider how your eating time affects your goals, exercise performance, and program sustainability. Here are the most important things to keep in mind when it comes to the timing of meals. I eat dinner between 7 to 7:30 pm, sleep between 9 to 10 pm and wake up between 4 to 5 am daily. I teach my 9 am workouts (moderate to high-intensity core and strength classes) six days a week. I already get hungry before 7 am, so I eat a light breakfast before my first client at 7 am. It’s usually as egg and piece of multigrain bread or a portion of home-cooked multigrain chia pancake. The breakfast gives me enough energy during my mid-morning workouts. On Sundays, I wake up at 5 am, and I work out on an empty stomach before 7 am to run, so I eat my breakfast between 8 to 8:30 am. Breakfast is essential for me to function well on my mid-morning workouts and to last the whole day successfully. Your breakfast time would always depend on your sleep, wake-up, and workout time. You can have a different schedule for sleep, exercise, and eating because everything depends on your lifestyle. I believe that your energy level should be prioritized to progress and achieve your desired fitness and health goals. To achieve this, you must carefully consider your sleep and food intake (timing, quantity, and quality). Waking up early and working out in the morning requires proper meal timing. A light breakfast one to two hours before your workout can give you enough energy to push your workouts harder, regulate your appetite throughout the day, and recover effectively. If you’ve been experiencing dizziness, high heart rate, mood swings, and weakness during and after your exercise sessions, this could mean something significant about your eating patterns. You might want to include a light breakfast one to two hours before your workout. Engaging in a moderate to intense workout in the morning might dictate a lot about your way of eating for the whole day. Aside from muscle recovery, eating a complete snack or lunch post-workout consisting of protein, carbs, and fat (such as a sandwich or brown rice meal with vegetables and viand) is important. It is so you can avoid hunger pangs and intense cravings and regulate the amount of food you will have for the rest of the day. Studies show that a 12-hour fasting window is beneficial to one’s health and weight management goals. It allows your body to process the calories efficiently and can help you avoid extra calories from mindless munching and late-night eating. If you are a night owl, you sleep between 11 pm to 1 am, and you wake up late (between 8 to 10 am), and you prefer late morning, afternoon, or evening workouts then your first meal (late breakfast or brunch) can be adjusted on a later time (between 9 to 12 noon) as well. I have observed that my clients who wake up late can stick to intermittent fasting better with a shorter eating window of less than 12 hours than the early birds. It is because they eat their first meal at a later time and can eat their last meal at 8 pm. There are things to consider when doing intermittent fasting with a shorter eating window (less than 12 hours) You need to focus on developing weight control and energy management skills while considering everything in moderation. Being too preoccupied with rules on fasting might sabotage your efforts. Balanced eating plays a big role in building your muscles and improving your metabolism, So listen to your body. Do not be too strict or obsessive about your intermittent meal timing, significantly if your energy level is affected. Be flexible when adjusting your meal timings depending on your schedule, activities, and energy level. You can eat earlier than your planned eating schedule when your body calls for food already, like situations when you experience weakness, dizziness, or mental breakdown. If you are trying to lose weight, as long as you are within the calorie recommendations, you can still achieve your weight loss goals. Extreme hunger pangs due to fasting can greatly affect your eating behavior. You can over-eat during meals within your eating window because of intense hunger. When it comes to choosing healthier foods, your decision-making skills might be affected – just eating whatever is available or choosing high-calorie foods such as fast foods, sweets, and junk foods to satisfy your hunger. The most important consideration: proper meal timing should always be integrated with the right amount and quality of food intake and movement to achieve your weight management goals.

The previously infected need not be vaccinated anymore,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/397731/the-previously-infected-need-not-be-vaccinated-anymore/,"04:15 PM February 28, 2022","We really find it hard to understand why our health officials still don’t recognize a previous infection with COVID-19 as at least equivalent to the immunity provided by full vaccination. There are now close to 150 researches indicating that natural immunity due to a previous infection confers equivalent, if not superior, protection compared to vaccine immunity. The pool of data suggests that natural immunity is likely more robust, longer-lasting and possibly more effective against the newer variants compared to vaccine-generated immunity. People are always quick to attribute the milder clinical course of the Omicron variant due to mass vaccination. There’s no arguing that they’re partly correct, but they should agree also to the evident real-world data that the more highly vaccinated a population is, the more susceptible they appear to be to the Omicron variant. Omicron has breezed through all currently available vaccines like it’s child’s play. The more vaccinated a country is, the higher the peaks of newly diagnosed cases are. Just look at the graphs showing new cases in Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States, and we realize why the heads of state of these countries concede that there’s no way—within the realm of currently available science—that we could possibly lick Omicron. And if we can’t lick ’em, we might as well join ’em. That’s why several countries have now thrown away their vaccine passes and other unreasonable restrictions, and just exhorted their citizens to use their best judgment on what to do and not do to prevent the spread and surge of Omicron and subsequent new variants. While these pragmatic countries have come to terms with reality and discarded their vaccine passes, we in the Philippines remain in an aggressive mode to get everyone vaccinated, including innocent, unsuspecting children, who have no inkling whatsoever of what they’re exchanging for lollipops and visits to the zoo. We seem to be still light-years away from realizing what we’ve been trying to say since last year, that mass vaccination will never get us to herd immunity. On the contrary, it may get us further away. Every time we get closer to what may be our exit out of this pandemic, we intensify our mass vaccination, and that enhances the creation of variants which will spur the next surge. And so, it will be a recurrent cycle of surge with a lull period in between, such as what we’re experiencing now. We shared the opinion of a few others a few weeks after Omicron was first reported in South Africa, that it might be the big break out of this pandemic we’ve been waiting for. As some described it, Omicron was the vaccine which man failed to make. It’s like a natural attenuated or weakened vaccine that’s good enough to produce a complete immune reaction, but weak enough to only cause mild disease. That’s why we deemed it irrational to vaccinate the population against it. It was sparing people from Delta, which was a lot deadlier, and the immunity earned from Omicron was strong enough to prevent a Delta infection. The other way around wasn’t true. Mass vaccination was squandering the golden opportunity offered by Omicron. It’s like a talent giving a stellar performance in “America’s Got Talent” in the first 90 percent of the performance, and just as Simon Cowell stands up to press the golden buzzer, the talent commits a faux pas that nullifies the entire performance. Intensifying mass vaccination seems to be that faux pas that can reverse the gains of what experts like Dr. Robert Malone described as the heaven-sent Omicron. We even recommended in a previous commentary that all low-risk individuals, especially healthy children and young adults, should go out and not mind being exposed to Omicron before it mutates into something more virulent. Although some labeled our suggestion foolish and irresponsible, we believed it was a lot safer and more responsible than vaccinating them with any of our currently available vaccines, which practically consigns them to a future of great uncertainties. We asked basic questions that could not be answered, like why should we still use our near-expiring, old-edition vaccines that were intended for the already long-gone, original Wuhan wild virus? Why still use these outdated vaccines that have shown to be already ineffective against Omicron? Why mandate vaccination for an infection that is just as mild as the ordinary seasonal flu? We never mandated everyone to get their flu shots. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has been staunchly advocating for mass vaccination for COVID-19, and you won’t really expect it to acknowledge the superiority of natural infection over vaccine immunity. But in a study they published recently in their Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, they practically conceded that protection from a previous COVID-19 infection was much better than that offered by vaccination against the Delta variant. The CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report is a weekly publication of relevant studies, which are not peer reviewed but have passed the scrutiny of CDC officials before being published. It’s said that the all studies published in this weekly report “constitutes the official voice” of the CDC. Researchers in the study looked at the health records from California and New York between May 30 and Nov. 20, 2021. COVID-19 patients were divided into four groups; namely 1) unvaccinated with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis, 2) unvaccinated with a previous COVID-19 infection, 3) vaccinated with no prior COVID-19 infection and 4) vaccinated with prior COVID-19 infection. The results showed that those who were not vaccinated but were infected previously were much less likely to test positive for COVID-19 when compared to vaccinated people who were not previously infected with COVID-19. The risk of hospitalization in the previously infected was also much less than in the vaccinated but not infected group. As expected, the unvaccinated without prior infection were at highest risk to get infected with COVID-19 and get hospitalized. “Importantly, infection-derived protection (natural immunity) was greater after the highly transmissible Delta variant became predominant, coinciding with early declining of vaccine-induced immunity in many persons,” the authors wrote. The authors should have gone further in recommending that if one already has a previous COVID-19 infection, one no longer needed to be vaccinated. There’s no meaningful benefit anymore from getting the jab. The study looked at records until late November, and likely did not cover patients infected with the Omicron variant. The Delta variant was the predominant variant during the period of the study. But somehow, the results reflect the relative effectiveness and degree of protection conferred by natural immunity versus vaccine immunity. For us, the bottom line is that vaccine immunity pales in comparison to natural immunity against a killer variant, which the Delta was. The big question therefore resurfaces—why don’t our health officials recognize natural immunity in those who already contracted COVID-19 and survived it? Why still mandate that these COVID-19 survivors get vaccinated, when the data clearly show there’s no meaningful incremental increase in immunity if you get them vaxxed? Vaccinating them only exposes them to the unnecessary risks of potentially serious side effects like blood clots, heart swelling, heart failure, irregular heartbeat with possible sudden death. Although this may occur only rarely, the hapless one in several thousands who’ll experience these serious vaccine side effects did not really have to expose himself to such risk were it not for the government mandate. This may well be a factor in why we have a coincidental increase in excess deaths due to heart attacks, strokes and other causes during the period that we started rolling out the vaccine. Our health officials should look into this more seriously before lives are unnecessarily compromised.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
‘World peace’: Beauty queens decry Russia’s attack on Ukraine,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/397530/world-peace-beauty-queens-decry-russias-attack-on-ukraine/,"12:20 PM February 26, 2022","MANILA, Philippines — Beauty queens really do want world peace. With the ongoing military operations of Russia on Ukraine dominating the news, even beauty titlists in the thick of preparations for their respective international competitions have found this hard to ignore. For reigning Miss Eco Philippines Kathleen Paton and Miss Environment Philippines Michelle Arceo, the escalating unrest on the former Soviet territory is a cause for concern, even for those who are miles away from where the brewing war is taking place. When a member of the pageant media asked in jest what her thoughts are on the matter, Paton gamely said, “I’m ready for that [question]!” And she was not kidding. When the Inquirer quizzed her at the sidelines of their intimate meeting with the local media at Pandan Asian Café in Quezon City on Feb. 24, Paton said, “I heard that Russia did make a move to Ukraine.” Arceo, for her part, told the Inquirer, “it is my duty [as a beauty queen] to be informed about what is happening worldwide. It’s unfortunate to see what is happening.” She also lamented the brewing speculation of a World War III, but appealed to the people not to get too occupied with thoughts “about how disastrous that could be.” The operatic singer continued: “I hope that the world’s nations can come into terms with each other.” The two also voiced their concern for those directly affected by the military actions. “I can’t even begin to imagine what the people of Ukraine are feeling right now… I hope they’re okay. I hope they’re safe. I hope the government there is doing the best that they can,” Paton said. Arceo, for her part, said, “I’m really praying to God that nothing happens, and we don’t lose any more lives.” She argued that as beauty queens, they really cannot do much about the situation “except have our own opinions.” But she is optimistic that beauty titlists can have a big enough voice through collective action, and “we can make a difference and talk to our governments.” Paton, who was born in Aklan before moving to Australia, also related the Russia-Ukraine conflict to an incident in her hometown. “In Aklan, something similar happened, but obviously not as extreme. One part of the island that Malay municipality thinks is theirs is actually in Nabas,” she shared. Paton’s family owns a cold spring resort in Nabas that has also borne the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic. Without any tourists coming, she said her mother has kept their doors open for the locals to swim for free, and offer a respite from the hardships that the global health crisis has brought to them. Arceo, meanwhile, touched on the environmental impact of Russia’s military operations, with her and Paton’s global pageants carrying a similar theme of protecting the planet. “When it comes to the ammunition and the military vehicles used, the impact is very high. I’m hoping we can talk to our governments and see how they can lower their carbon emissions,” she said. Paton is gunning for the country’s second Miss Eco International crown in the global tilt’s seventh edition, which will be staged in Egypt on March 14. Cynthia Thomalla became the first Filipino woman to bring home the crown when she won in 2018. Her successors Maureen Montagne and Kelley Day both finished second in 2019 and 2021, respectively. No competition was staged in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Arceo will compete in the first edition of the Miss Environment pageant which will be staged in India in April.

Note to parents: Choose to earn your child’s respect,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/397396/note-to-parents-choose-to-earn-your-childs-respect/,"03:34 PM February 22, 2022","There was a time when good kids were defined as those who just accepted orders from their parents. Children followed out of fear, not respect. With so much resentment built up, we learned that this autocratic parenting style is ultimately detrimental. Even if you grew up this way, it’s not too late to change. Past is past, and it doesn’t have to be where you are tomorrow. Today’s kids are growing up in the info age, so parents need to adapt. The Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (Ceap-NCR) recently held a webinar for parents titled “Strength in the Midst of the Pandemic: Parents’ Love Offering.” Parenting and relationship specialists from The Love Institute preached the principles of parenting with the acronym Anak (child): Atensyon sa anak at sa sarili, Negosasyon at disiplina, Aruga sa anak at sa asawa, at Komunikasyon.‘Atensyon sa anak at sa sarili’ The Institute’s Aiza Caparas-Tabayoyong stressed the need to schedule one-on-one time to get to know each of your children, so each one feels special. “Put it in your calendar. Fill them with love, especially in the first 10 years of life,” advised the Institute’s Ma. Isabel Sison-Dionisio. She also recommended to “connect before you correct” and to catch children doing good. Sison-Dionisio explained that if parents only give attention when kids are fighting or doing something naughty, the bad behavior will be reinforced. We need to reflect on how we were disciplined by our parents before, its effect on us now, and how we discipline our kids. “Don’t let history dictate how you parent today,” said the Institute’s Juanito P. Caballes. Discipline is not pagpaparusa (punishment), pananakot like “kukunin ka ng bumbay o ng pari” (fear of consequence or negative reinforcement), or panghihiya (shaming or sarcasm). If we need our tween to do something, we shouldn’t be bossy. Set not “the law” but an agreement. Ask, “What time is good for you?” Involve them in setting house rules by asking, “What do you think?” when visiting a friend’s house, doing household chores, study time, screen time, curfew and family time. Sison-Dionisio discouraged rescuing a child who forgets their project at home. Instead, she suggested letting the child experience the natural, logical consequence of getting a demerit, then teaching them how to make a checklist so they won’t forget next time. “What we want is for them to learn how to discipline themselves,” explained Caballes. “Ask, ‘What will happen, anak, if you don’t pack away?’ Toy pieces might get lost. ‘What will happen if you fight?’ You will lose time playing with the game. ‘What will happen if the dishes don’t get washed?’ Pests will come, germs will thrive in our home. “‘You don’t want to eat? Don’t. But no crying later when you get hungry and don’t expect a new meal to be made for you. That’s also aruga sa asawa (nurturing your spouse).” Instead of spanking, yelling or punishing, build their internal compass. Have them get along with their sibling or do what’s right not out of fear but because they know the consequences.‘Aruga sa anak at sa asawa’ Caparas-Tabayoyong emphasized having a relationship with each child. Highlight and praise their strengths and good qualities. Compare them only with the old version of themselves, not with others. (“You don’t need as much help with online schooling now unlike last year!”) Notice their contributions and make them feel your acceptance. Say, “I like the way you handled your problem with your schoolwork.” Also, ask them what they appreciate about Dad, Mom and their siblings to create a positive atmosphere of healthy self-worth. Put-downs affect confidence, so we must lift our children’s spirits. Stop focusing on what’s deficient (“Why did you get eight out of 10 in your test?”). They will feel they lack something instead of feeling whole.Caballes also pointed out the need to strengthen our relationship with our spouse. “Have a weekly date, chat with each other daily for 15 minutes,” he said. “Love is spelled T-I-M-E. Have breakfast together while the kids are still asleep. Affirm each other’s strengths. Find what you appreciate and express it. Say it, write it. Avoid negative labels because your children and spouse imbibe these and become their reality.” “I am striving to understand you, anak. Is this what you’re saying?” Caballes suggested echoing back what our children say so they feel heard. Try “I” messages: “I feel worried when you don’t study right away because I might not be able to help you later when I’m busy with something else. Maybe you can play a bit for 20 minutes now then study for 20 minutes after?” Express the values of integrity and honesty. Ask them to list the advantages and disadvantages of letting you do their work for them. Say, “It’s like going to the gym, letting Mama do the sit-ups and expecting you to get the abs.” If you’re not naturally communicative, start somewhere. Otherwise, your kids might become distant in the future, resentment can build up and harden. Stubbornly holding onto “This is how I am” can’t be an excuse. As parents, we need to listen and empathize with our children. The specialists’ core message is for parents to choose to earn their children’s respect. This means not putting parents on a pedestal. Everyone gets a say and gets to contribute. Children who grow up having a voice means that when they’re in school, in a relationship, or get a job, they can have respect. It doesn’t mean they can sass back. When they do, report how you’re feeling and make requests. Say, “I know you’re mad at (your friend/teacher) and I feel like you’re taking it out on me. When you’re no longer so angry, let’s talk later.” Modeling these behaviors takes time, especially if this isn’t the atmosphere you grew up in. But as with most things, practice makes perfect. Our spouse and children will appreciate our trying. —CONTRIBUTED INQ ###—### #Byline2 @Inq_Lifestyle By Jemps Gallegos Yuvienco @Inq_Lifestyle  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Natural ways to get rid of your belly fat while strengthening your core and toning your abs,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/397378/natural-ways-to-get-rid-of-your-belly-fat-while-strengthening-your-core-and-toning-your-abs/,"09:50 PM February 21, 2022","Accumulation of excessive belly fat (deep and superficial) in your body due to poor diet, lack of sleep, sedentary lifestyle, excessive alcohol drinking, and a stressful lifestyle can cause serious health problems. You cannot lose your belly fat by just doing numerous repetitions of crunches. It would be best to focus on overall fat loss and balancing your hormones. It also involves lifestyle modification by giving importance to healthy and balanced eating, proper recovery, and enough movement. Your mindset should be about losing the extra body fat around your body instead of just focusing on weight loss. If you want to develop well-defined or toned abs, incorporate more challenging core moves in your regular workout routine. I combined my personal experience, encounters with clients, and scientifically proven strategies to develop tips on losing stubborn belly fat effectively. Be aware of your body type Patterns of fat loss would depend on a person’s body type. If you are top-heavy, you will find it more challenging to lose belly fat than someone who is bottom-heavy. You can lose inches off your waist, but it will be the last one to go. It would be best to focus on overall fat loss by changing your eating and adding more movement to your lifestyle. Just be patient, and you can achieve a smaller waistline by being consistent with your healthy lifestyle program. Consider your life stage Hormones play a significant role in developing extra belly fat. As you grow older, you will notice changes in your body, especially as you reach your mid-forties, approaching the peri-menopausal stage. According to studies, during menopause, estrogen (a sex hormone responsible for regulating the female reproductive system) levels drop. It can be a cause of unfavorable belly fat accumulation. Don’t wait for this stage to happen before you do something about your body. As early as now, it would help if you did everything possible to embrace a healthy lifestyle. Manage your stress Getting enough sleep, managing your stress, and giving time for recovery is crucial when it comes to losing your belly fat. Cortisol is a hormone produced by your body to deal with short-term stress. High levels of cortisol in your body on a long-term basis, however, can cause weight gain and other health problems. The only way to regulate the amount of cortisol is to manage your stress by getting seven to eight hours of sleep, practicing breathing exercises and meditation, getting a massage, and starting a mild to moderate exercise program. Remember that restricting your body from nutrients while overexercising can stress your body and affect your hormones. That’s why you need to practice everything in moderation. You can feel the balance within your system when your energy levels during exercise are high and fully functional (mentally, emotionally, and physically) during the day. Another indicator is when your recovery is sufficient to prepare you for the next day to handle the same (or more) type and volume of workload. Modify your eating Aside from going beyond the recommended calorie intake per day, studies show that excessive sugar consumption from sodas and other sweets products can attract deep and superficial belly fat. The American Heart Association’s (AHA) recommended sugar consumption for women is up to six teaspoons a day and up to nine teaspoons for men. A serving of soft drinks, ice tea, or fruit beverages already contains six to eight teaspoons of sugar. You can also read nutrition labels of snacks, yogurt, and cereals and check the amount of sugar (one teaspoon of sugar is equivalent to 4 grams and 16 calories). Focus on healthy food regularly such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, seafood, lean meat, chicken (without the skin), seeds, and nuts. Aside from sweets, lessen other high-calorie foods that can easily cause fat gain: Balance your workout routine To lose body fat effectively, you need to be consistent with your daily workouts. It is why you need to get a good balance of cardio and strength workouts during the week. Do cardio on most days of the week for a healthy heart. Incorporate strength training at least twice a week to build muscles needed to improve overall strength, reshape your body, increase metabolism and burn extra fats. Good endurance is important every time you execute your strength training routine to progress your intensity and get better results. A good strength workout is needed to sustain your cardio workouts by improving your exercise posture and strengthening your lower body and core–important in preventing injuries while doing prolonged cardio exercises such as running and cycling. Try high-calorie full-body strength training workouts If you are trying to lose weight and only have three times a week to dev workouts, do full-body strength training workouts rather than focusing on one to two body parts for each session. Full-body exercises, especially involving lower-body moves like squats and lunges, can raise your heart rate faster. A higher heart rate within your recommended range means higher calorie burn. It is easier to burn more calories by doing compound moves. If you are trying to gain more weight (muscle mass) while losing body fat, incorporate a heavyweight training routine in your weekly exercise routine while following a healthy eating plan. Do the most effective exercises to target your core while burning more calories Since there is no such thing as spot reduction, instead of doing numerous ab flexion exercises such as sit-ups or crunches, focus more on intense core exercises such as plank (and plank variations) and standing core work.

Be careful with your heart during COVID,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/397057/be-careful-with-your-heart-during-covid/,"05:10 PM February 14, 2022","It’s the heart month, not only in a romantic sense, but in a medical sense, as well. It’s an opportune time to remind everyone not to neglect their heart problems due to their overwhelming fear of COVID-19, as if the viral infection was a worse killer than heart disease. Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in the Philippines and in many parts of the world. And the way it looks, we’ll have many excess deaths due to heart attacks and even stroke during the pandemic because of failure to go for a much-needed checkup. Some even discontinue their maintenance medicines because they have not seen their doctors for quite some time, and the drugstore would no longer honor their old prescriptions. The uptick in cardiovascular cases may also be related to COVID-19 or vaccination. We’re seeing quite a number of newly diagnosed cardiovascular cases who either had a previous COVID-19 infection or had been vaccinated. Yes, both an infection and vaccination can wreak havoc in the cardiovascular system for some unlucky ones. Some dismiss their symptoms, like shortness of breath or palpitations, as being due to fatigue, overwork or stress, but if it persists for more than three weeks following an infection, it’s best to consult your physician for a checkup to clear your heart. The most common single finding we note in these patients is an increase in the resting heart rate (RHR). Many have the wrong impression that the normal RHR is 60 up to 100 beats a minute. An athletic son of a patient used to have an RHR of 55 to 60 a minute. A week after getting his second vaccine shot, his RHR increased to 86 to 95 a minute. He thought it was still within normal range so he didn’t mind it, but he noted he couldn’t even jog for more than 300 meters, whereas before he would regularly jog 5 to 6 kilometers at least three times a week. On physical examination, he already had what is called a “gallop rhythm,” heard by means of a stethoscope in individuals with heart failure. His heart was already slightly enlarged previously because he was athletic, but it got even bigger, and chest X-ray showed that the lungs were congested with excess water due to his heart failure. We diagnosed him to likely have myocarditis or heart swelling, causing the heart to fail. Since we could not identify any other possible cause in a young adult—such as heavy drinking (alcoholic cardiomyopathy), recent viral infection (viral myocarditis) or prohibited drugs (drug-induced cardiomyopathy)—we identified his heart swelling and failure as a vaccine side effect. He responded well to treatment and didn’t require hospitalization any more. But with a diagnosis of myocarditis, his heart has to be monitored from time to time to see if there’s persistence of the heart swelling and weakening of the heart muscles. An infection, especially COVID-19, can also cause myocarditis and even stroke or brain attack. At the start of the pandemic two years ago, we would be perplexed whenever we admitted a young adult patient with COVID-19 symptoms and stroke. We usually don’t see stroke in the young as frequently as we got to see them during the pandemic. Now we know, heart attack and stroke can be complications of the viral infection, usually due to the immune reaction the spike proteins can cause in the lining of the arteries in the heart or brain. This reaction causes the body’s immune cells circulating in the blood to attack the spike proteins lodged in the lining of the arteries. That causes inflammation or swelling of the arterial lining and blood clots to form in the arteries, leading to a stroke or heart attack. The increase in RHR or tachycardia can just be a transient reaction to either the virus during an infection, or to the vaccine. The fast RHR should normalize in a few days. If it remains faster by more than 20 percent than your usual RHR, and with unexplained symptoms, better get a checkup. So, we advise everyone to know their baseline or RHR. After a 10-minute rest, in a relaxed sitting or lying position, take your pulse rate three times one minute apart. Discard the first reading and average the second and third readings. That’s your RHR. Let’s say your RHR is 70 per minute, then after recovering from COVID-19 or getting a jab, your heart rate is consistently 84 per minute or faster, accompanied by symptoms you didn’t have before, better have yourself checked. A healthy RHR is usually less than 80 per minute. In those with heart problems already, an ideal RHR is less than 70 per minute. We want the RHR slower in those with heart problems because the faster the RHR, the higher the oxygen consumption of the heart. It’s like revving up your engine when idle in a traffic. You’re unnecessarily consuming more gasoline. The same thing happens to the heart. With a faster RHR, more oxygen is consumed even at rest, and that can trigger a heart attack because of the deficiency in the oxygen supply to the heart due to excessive oxygen consumption or expenditure. Some become worried if their RHR is less than 60 per minute, say 55 per minute. Up to 50 per minute is still a good RHR. In fact, we give medicines to slow down the RHR of heart patients to cut down on their oxygen consumption. In patients with heart problems, they can also develop arrhythmias, or irregular heart beating. A fast heart rate by itself, say more than 100 per minute, may be considered an arrhythmia, called tachycardia. But many can develop even worse arrhythmia, a fairly common form of which is called atrial fibrillation (AF). When one develops AF, the heart beats irregularly, and it should be promptly treated. It can cause the heart to fail and form blood clots, which then get carried by the circulation, blocking a brain artery and causing a stroke, or a leg artery, causing gangrene and requiring amputation. Because of their arrhythmia, some may faint (syncope) because there’s not enough blood going up to the brain. Some arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia) can really be serious and may cause the heart to suddenly stop (ventricular fibrillation or ventricular arrest). So, feeling palpitations, giddiness, dizziness or fainting spells during or after a COVID-19 infection or vaccination may need further evaluation to rule out any serious heart complication. Since you’re already taking your RHR, you might as well check your baseline blood pressure (BP) using the same procedure as when you check your RHR. With most BP digital devices, you can get your BP and RHR at the same time. A COVID-19 infection or vaccination can increase your BP, so better to check that your baseline BP is within normal range—less than 140/90 millimeters of mercury at rest before you go for your jab. If it’s more than 160/90 mmHg, it’s better to defer your vaccination. The BP may increase for a few days but should stabilize even without adjusting your BP meds. If the BP exceeds 140/90 for more than a week already, it’s best to consult your physician for a possible adjustment in your maintenance meds. And yes, the increase in resting BP and RHR usually goes hand in hand. Many also have the wrong notion that since they’re just working from home and feel more relaxed, they can discontinue their BP and other maintenance heart meds. This can be dangerous because without the protection offered by your maintenance meds, your BP and RHR can suddenly shoot up to stroke-causing levels when you’re suddenly exposed to any form of stress—physical, emotional, mental, etc. Don’t ever take a chance with your life. Once a hypertensive, forever a hypertensive; chances are, you’ll require maintenance meds for life. We do antihypertensive step-down adjustments, i.e., reducing the dose of antihypertensive meds when the BP is already low and stable, but this has to be done gradually and strictly under a doctor’s supervision. Never do it on your own. There are tricky spots about stepping down treatment, which can cause big complications you’ll regret forever. So, in this merry month of hearts in love, show your love for your heart by following not only safety protocols to prevent COVID-19, but addressing possible unhealthy gaps in your lifestyle. If you don’t know them yet, find out your baseline BP and RHR, and don’t ever let the virus or its vaccine mess with your heart.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Why exercise is the best Valentine’s gift that you can give your loved one,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/396542/why-exercise-is-the-best-valentines-gift-that-you-can-give-your-loved-one/,"01:48 PM February 08, 2022","Valentine’s Day is just around the corner. Instead of thinking about what material things to give your loved one, think of a unique activity or experience that you can do together. Go to the beach and do your favorite water sports, go on a hike, get a couple’s massage, or simply walk outdoors. The ultimate Valentine’s gift that you can give each other right now is realizing that exercise is an important part of your relationship as a team. If you are fit and well, you can always avoid sexual health issues like low sex drive, stress, lack of energy, and other health problems. Instead, you can have that type of physical, emotional, and mental energy necessary to experience long-term sexual satisfaction with your spouse. Working out with your partner is the simplest, healthiest, and most special date you can ever experience right now. You don’t need to try so hard, spend too much, and stress yourself out thinking of ways to give color to your relationship as a couple. You need to move together, value health as a team, and communicate well with each other. Giving importance to exercise can do wonders for your health and overall well-being. Instead of worrying about the medical and hospital bills, you can spend more quality time together while you both age gracefully. Living a healthy lifestyle with your partner gives you that positive outlook in life, better mood sense, and peace of mind.

What this pro wrestler learned from a wild pandemic fitness journey,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/395871/what-this-pro-wrestler-learned-from-a-wild-pandemic-fitness-journey/,"05:05 PM January 28, 2022","One of my earliest memories of the pandemic was escaping the lockdown in Manila before it started, completely oblivious to the fact that Laguna (where my parents’ house is) would soon be affected. The Sunday before the first lockdown was imposed in the south, I was still up late at my 24/7 gym, pulling heavy deadlifts, and thinking that I could do this for the next two weeks or so while the capital was frozen in place. At that point, I don’t think anybody expected that we would be forced to stop working out. As a pro wrestler, I had to keep moving, or else I would waste away and be totally out of shape for when it was time to perform again. But we were not prepared for the standstill that would ensue so nobody made plans for pandemic fitness. As we would all find out for ourselves, life makes you rethink your plans. Aside from needing to be in performance shape, I was in the middle of a drastic cutting phase when enhanced community quarantine was first imposed, so I didn’t want to put a pause on working out while I counted my decreased calories. I did what I could with what I had, even if it wasn’t as taxing as lifting weights in the gym. In the 22 months we’ve been dealing with the pandemic, I can easily say I’ve run the gauntlet of exercises, going on what I can only call a roller coaster ride with my body and personal fitness. I’ll lay out my journey here to possibly try and inspire anyone who’s been disheartened by the situation we’re in to get moving, even if only a little bit at first. I started with bodyweight workouts that I could easily do in my living room, testing my strength with slowed movements and accommodating resistance. It was similar to the weight training program I was doing before the pandemic hit (called Minimalist Fitness by Cho Lim) so I figured it was the best thing I could do at the time.  I was beating my body up with slowed push-ups, resisted bodyweight flys, and squats. For cardio, I bought this Nintendo Switch game called Fitness Boxing, which uses the controllers as movement trackers that could detect your punches. I kept this up for the whole summer of 2020. When the 24/7 gym opened in a limited capacity sometime in July, I tried to go back, but the strict booking policy made it tough to just wander in and out as I pleased, which I liked to do. I couldn’t get a groove on my weight training program but it wouldn’t matter as another surge would force the gym to close for the rest of the year.  At that point, completely deflated by the fact that I didn’t have a gym I could go to, an athletic life I could come back to anytime soon, and a mild bout of COVID-19, I essentially just gave up on staying fit. I realized I didn’t like working out at home, where I didn’t really have much space to move as much as I wanted, and I preferred to work out with heavy weights instead of relying on calisthenics, which didn’t give me obvious results due to the inherent lack of progression. I completely stopped doing any kind of exercise and started eating all the junk I wanted because I figured, hell, life is short. When gyms did open again in January 2021, I made sure to come back. There weren’t any vaccines yet but it seemed safe to go, especially in Laguna where cases weren’t as numerous as in NCR. I worked out and stopped counting my calories, preferring to focus on lifting heavy and building strength. I stuck to my old plan because it got me through the gym in an hour. Despite not looking my best, it gave me the results I liked, which was getting stronger and lifting the heaviest I’ve ever lifted in my life. Unfortunately, another surge in March 2021 would close the gyms again after only three months—and even though I had started to work out already, I gave up on doing any sort of exercise again, keeping my preference for only working out with weights. Somewhere along the way in my sedentary lifestyle that summer, I realized that I wanted to get off my butt and work out seriously again. I and a lot of other people had already gotten the COVID-19 vaccine, so I figured life would be returning to normal soon enough, and I wanted to be fit again when it did.   Gyms were still closed, but I still wanted to lift heavy weights, so I started looking into buying my own exercise equipment—specifically, a squat and bench rack I could set up in my parents’ house, an Olympic barbell, and plates. I figured those were all I needed to put together a decent program. I got the home equipment I needed, and I was able to start doing barbell-centric workouts. I even started tracking my calories again, as I wanted to cut some of the 30 pounds I had gained in my joy-eating over the pandemic.  I kept at it at home for a couple of months before the gyms had finally opened again, which takes us to the present day. Now I’m back in the gym despite the risks because they’ve got more equipment than I do at home. Even though I had only used it for a few months, the home setup was still a worthwhile purchase because it helped me overcome any excuses I had for not working out—specifically, the lack of access to a fully equipped gym. Anyway, I suspect I’ll need the home equipment again someday. While it was a wild experience going from lean to fat to a balanced body in the span of those 22 months, it all worked out for me in the end. For one, it made me realize that the process of exercise and the lack thereof isn’t the be-all, end-all for my fitness. I could start and stop whenever I wanted to, and I proved to myself that I could be disciplined enough to work toward my fitness goals, even when the world is falling apart.  For those who may not be feeling up to it, especially after a long layoff, know that you can always get back into the groove by starting small and ramping up the effort as you go along. It’s not impossible, even in a pandemic, as long as you want it. Another thing I should note is taking time off did actually do me favors. Even though I had closely approached obesity from all the weight I had gained, it took a pandemic and a break from working out for me to get the body mass I had so desperately wanted when I was actively and consistently exercising for six or so years. Returning to the gym just let me fine-tune my body to a point where I was really happy with it. Lastly, and most importantly, picking up exercise again at a time when everything seems doomed gave me something positive to focus on. While now I sometimes feel like I have to drag myself to the gym (the motivation isn’t always there, as we seasoned lifters know all too well), I’ve learned, or maybe relearned, to appreciate each workout session for building toward the bigger goal. In a time where it’s easy to be a fatalist, simply looking forward to the final product is a really easy way to get by every day.

How to effectively listen to your body during the pandemic,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/395640/how-to-effectively-listen-to-your-body-during-the-pandemic/,"03:07 PM January 24, 2022","The pandemic is giving you more opportunities to listen to your body. Spend some time to close your eyes, breathe, relax and observe how your body is feeling right now. Is your heart beating faster now? Are you having a more challenging time focusing and concentrating? Do you find it hard to relax your shoulders? It is essential to connect with your body and give attention to whatever discomfort or unusual feelings you are experiencing right now so you can manage your health issues as early as now. Last week, I started going to the hospital for a comprehensive health check-up that includes the most important laboratory tests and procedures for my age, family history, and previous/current health and fitness condition. I just recovered from a mild case of COVID-19, so aside from fulfilling my annual physical check-up. I wanted to complete the most important health tests, even if I had already regained my strength since I got better a couple of weeks ago. You might not be feeling something serious about your health right now. Still, the pandemic might have affected your overall health due to a recent illness/ changes in lifestyle like less physical activity, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive food intake. If going to the clinic or hospital is not yet possible at this point, schedule an online consultation with a doctor to have your preliminary health check. Most health facilities now offer laboratory tests that can be done in the comfort of your house. When you are ready, you can go to a hospital and do the necessary screening tests depending on what your doctor will recommend based on your current health condition. I decided to shift to decaf coffee almost eight months ago. It was challenging for me initially, especially during my early morning online exercise sessions that usually require more push and enthusiasm from me as a fitness coach. However, I wanted to naturally boost my energy without relying on supplements or caffeine so I could listen to my body regulate and balance my energy throughout the day. I successfully stuck to the same habit of having a mug of decaf coffee for the whole day until today. Instead of getting an energy fix from caffeine, I would take 15 to 30-minute naps when there’s an opportunity after lunch to recharge and regain my strength that could last the next half of my day. Your doctor might advise you to limit caffeine intake to manage health issues like hypertension, anxiety, insomnia, or digestive problems. And if you want to rely more on your natural physical energy, discontinue taking pre-workout caffeinated drinks or try to gradually limit your caffeine intake by having a cup of coffee a day instead of two or three and eventually shift to decaf. Distribute your natural energy throughout the day so you can effectively approach things in moderation, avoid stress and get the much-needed pause or rest when needed. Avoiding stimulants can allow your body to stick consistently to a sleep schedule. Keep in mind that getting quality sleep is very important for fighting diseases and improving your overall well-being. Aside from getting clearance from your doctor before you resume your workouts, you need to listen to your body and have a recovery plan after an illness such as the regular flu or COVID-19, which can help protect your body from getting possible health complications. Increase your body awareness by checking how you feel before, during, and after an exercise session. Physically prepare your body by ensuring that you have the right amount of nutrients, are well-hydrated (eight or more glasses a day), and have enough sleep (seven to nine hours). Always be prepared to modify your exercise regarding pace, load, duration, form, and execution. Do not be in a hurry to resume right away to your previous fitness level. Depending on your current fitness and health condition, it might take some time. Have the proper exercise warm-up to help prepare yourself physically and mentally. Check your heart rate by wearing a fitness tracker or manually checking your pulse regardless of the exercise intensity. Your target heart (THR) rate during an exercise session is dependent on your age and exercise intensity goal.
Moderate exercise intensity: Achieve 50 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate (MHR)
Vigorous exercise intensity: Achieve 70 to 85 percent percent of your MHR To compute for the THR of a 40-year old exerciser who intends to keep a low to moderate intensity during a workout session:
Get the MHR: 220- Age (40) = 180 beats per minute (bpm) Compute for the THR (50 to 70 percent of MHR) range: 180 X .50 = 90 bpm and 180 X .70 = 126 bpm So a 40-year old exerciser should maintain a heart rate range of 80 to 126 bpm during a low to moderate exercise intensity. Have the proper cool-down by incorporating breathing work with your stretches. After a workout session, observe how your body returns to your pre-exercise state by rechecking your heart rate.

Cristalle Belo on raising her kids in Australia: ‘We set limits’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/394716/cristalle-belo-on-raising-her-kids-in-australia-we-set-limits/,"05:42 PM January 18, 2022","As the first lockdown extended in 2020, Cristalle Belo-Pitt and her Australian husband, Justin Pitt, observed that their toddler, Hunter James, started to behave like most quarantined children. Their once ebullient and sociable firstborn became anxious and withdrawn, having been deprived of socializing, play spaces and nature activities. Justin then raised the idea of bringing the family to his hometown, Adelaide, in South Australia, for the well-being of Hunter and their newborn Siena Victoria. “At that time, the number of cases in the Philippines was rising rapidly, while there were zero cases in South Australia due to strict border control, free mass testing and intense contact tracing,” recalls Cristalle. In July 2020, the Pitts went to Australia with a plan to stay for six months. But the outdoorsy lifestyle of Adelaide, less restrictive pandemic measures and well-structured health system made them extend their stay. They plan to return to Manila in September 2022. As managing director of the Belo Medical Group, Cristalle has been working remotely, although she devotes 70 percent of her time to family life. “Being the primary caregivers of young children makes it challenging for us to get things done. I really need that one day off a week (with both kids in day care) just to recharge, rest and take care of myself,” she says. Justin, on the other hand, has been procuring Australian wellness products that address pandemic concerns, which he plans to sell in the Philippines. He recently secured the Philippine distributorship of Aurum Plus, a natural medicine that helps reduce anxiety and depression, and is collaborating with chemists on an immunity-boosting vitamin range. Starting life in Australia, the couple took Hunter to different parks, but he still remained cautious, unlike the adventurous boy that he was. They enrolled him in a school where he was initially very reserved. Although he joined activities, he didn’t speak to his teachers and classmates. “After a few months, he finally warmed up and got used to being social again,” writes Cristalle in an email interview. “Moving to Australia was the best decision for our children who can go out freely, explore nature and socialize with others their age. It has also been good for me, Justin, and our mental well-being.” In a lifestyle without helpers and nannies, Cristalle easily adapted, since the couple have shared responsibilities. “I’m so lucky to have a husband who is so hands-on with the children and who loves to cook! Hunter is assigned to him and Siena is assigned to me. I do the cleaning, laundry and dishwashing, while Justin does the cooking,” she says. “On a typical day, we bring one child to school while the other one stays with us so they both get their ‘only child with both parents’ days throughout the week. There are days when we have both kids and just one day without any kids to be able to get some work done (meetings are also scheduled on that kid-free day). Every day, we make sure the kids get nature play in the park. Luckily, there are so many parks and playgrounds here in Adelaide. When we get home from a long day, Justin cooks dinner and we wind down by getting into our evening routine—bath, books then bed.” When the children are in bed by 7:30 p.m., the couple continues household chores or work, watch TV and, if time permits, go on a date at a restaurant. It’s a bonus that the home of Justin’s parents is a 15-minute drive from theirs. “We get the family support that we need, especially when it comes to helping out with the children,” adds Cristalle. Although Hunter is 3½ years old and Siena is turning 2 in March, the Pitts don’t believe in infantilizing. Describing their strategy called “respectful parenting,” Cristalle explains: “We acknowledge that we don’t ‘own the kids.’ They are little humans who have their own choices, opinions, emotions, and we respect that. We don’t impose things on them. “As much as possible, we give them options for them to make a choice. We understand that they are going through waves of emotions (little humans with big feelings) and sometimes need help dealing with those feelings, so we guide them through the emotions. We are firm but loving. We set limits early on. Setting limits and sticking to a routine is important to us. Not having help, we want the kids to be as independent as possible, and this allows them to do so because they know what to expect.” The discipline is balanced by love as Cristalle is a touchy-feely person. “More than words, the family feels my nurturing side through physical touch. Justin and I share that as a love language. We are very cariño with each other and this is how we express that love to the children.” To introduce them to Filipino culture, she befriends Filipina mothers with children close to her kids’ age. “We get together weekly and speak Tagalog to the children. I’ve also found a supplier in Australia for Filipino books and flashcards (Abakada Australia), which helps me teach kids some Tagalog words,” she says. Ultimately, a year in quiet Adelaide—away from the social whirl and conveniences of helpers in Manila—has brought out the innate flexibility and patience in Cristalle. Family life becomes her. —CONTRIBUTED 1. The children are little human beings who deserve respect. Don’t expect them to be like you. They have their own ideas, desires and emotions. Acknowledging that changes the way you approach the children. 2. Mental presence makes a world of difference. Moments when you are listening to them, acknowledging their emotions and trying your best to understand their ideas mean a lot to them. They will respect and listen to you more if they feel they are being heard and their “needs and wants” are taken into consideration. 3. Be authentic. Parents are also human beings and are not perfect. There are times I find myself apologizing to my son Hunter because I misread what he wanted and did something else. We are very chill about these moments, and misunderstandings don’t become a big deal.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Keeping our cool amid Omicron,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/395135/keeping-our-cool-amid-omicron/,"01:28 PM January 15, 2022","A close friend greeted me Happy New Year a little late, explaining that her whole family came down with COVID a few days after their clan’s Christmas get-together, but that everyone had either fully recovered or was on the mend. All family members had received medical treatment at home. I asked her if her family was vaccinated and what COVID variant had hit them. She answered yes, everyone was fully jabbed, and confirmed that the culprit was Omicron. This was not an isolated case. Other friends have reported that while some family members had recently been infected with COVID, they had recovered at home after several days. And while new cases are dramatically increasing, daily particularly in the National Capital Region (NCR), available data shows that the great majority of positive cases are either mild or asymptomatic. To avoid unnecessarily overburdening our health-care facilities, some medical experts have recommended that hospital officials refer such cases for home care. December was a great blessing, giving our countrymen a brief respite from the relentless onslaught of the pandemic over the past two years. At a more lenient alert level 2, we were able to experience returning to some normalcy in our lives—Christmas shopping in the malls, dining out, socializing with friends, and most importantly, being with family members more frequently. But this newfound freedom was short-lived. A new COVID variant named Omicron, first identified in South Africa, was quickly spreading to many countries in December. Experts were saying that it was only a matter of time before it came to our shores. True enough, with rapidly rising new cases, NCR was immediately upgraded to alert level 3 on Jan. 3, and other regions quickly followed. As of this writing, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority has announced that it is keeping NCR at alert level 3, but may bring it up to level 4 if the situation warrants it. Another action being seriously considered is to ramp up the government’s vaccination drive with another round of “national vaccination day.” But most controversial is the drastic restriction on the movement of unvaccinated persons, many of whom are complaining that it is only lately that they have been able to resume earning a living. The official rejoinder, as expected, is for them to get themselves vaccinated, which they should have done before. The President himself has weighed in on the issue of “no vaccine, no out-of-home travel,” going as far as enjoining local officials to “restrain” unvaxxed individuals caught outside their homes. He was very careful not to use the word “arrest,” because, as the Commission on Human Rights had warned, arresting persons who have not committed any crime was unconstitutional, and there was as yet no law passed restricting freedom of movement, which could be resorted to in the interest of national security, public safety or public health. I am no medical expert, and am neither rabidly “provax” or “antivax,” but simply “proreason.” But from a social responsibility standpoint, I believe every person is at least entitled to “informed consent,” i.e., be made aware of the nature, composition, advantages and possible adverse effects of any medication he ingests or that is put inside his body. This is standard practice in the medical literature inside the packaging of the usual medicines we buy in drugstores. It should apply even more to experimental drugs with no proven long-term track record for safety. Thus, while mass vaccination to achieve “herd immunity” may be a valid society-wide goal for state authorities, the means to achieve it should not be coercive, and people’s inherent freedom of choice should be respected. At best, strong campaigns promoting and explaining the benefits of vaccination can be undertaken to overcome vaccine hesitancy or rejection. Although global health institutions have been unequivocally pushing mass vaccination, many independent but equally qualified medical experts, including the pioneer of the mRNA vaccine himself, are vocal in expressing caveats for their universal use. Moreover, six of the former transition-team public health advisers of US President Joe Biden are strongly urging him today to change his present vaccine-centric response to the pandemic in three simultaneous articles published in Journal of the American Medical Association (Newsweek.com, Jan. 6). Locally, presenting a balanced view in my mind is Dr. Rafael Castillo, a respected medical practitioner who treats COVID patients and writes a widely read column in this newspaper. He was lengthily interviewed on Jan. 6 on dzRH-TV. I cite some of his observations and insights: Given these wide-ranging observations, what is the basis for discriminating against those who are unvaccinated, either by choice or by circumstance, considering that most people need to go out and earn a living? The currently available data strongly suggests that vaccination is no longer a major preventive factor in transmission. As for severity of infection, the vast majority of new cases are in the mild or asymptomatic range. Obviously, certain restrictions are still necessary, e.g., on large gatherings, use of public transport, recreational facilities, restaurants, clubs and other venues. But if availment was to be restricted or prohibited, what reason is there not to equally apply it to everyone, including the other way around? Our government authorities should consider this seriously before further reimposing stringent measures selectively and causing more unrest. —CONTRIBUTED   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2022
Movies about imperfect women trying get a fresh start,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/394942/movies-about-imperfect-women-trying-get-a-fresh-start/,"09:18 PM January 11, 2022","Born a woman, I have a complicated relationship with the word lovely. It’s like a combination of poised, charming, and capable but appreciative. It’s the perfect adjective to describe the “ideal” woman. But what I am is an irascible mess. Who do I turn to for inspiration if I want to get my sh*t together? As it turns out, fictional women and families who are just as imperfect as I am. Here’s a list of movies centered on women (who aren’t born out of a film bro’s wet dream) turning a new leaf. It’s not a smooth ride, but that’s how it usually is IRL. Right?  One can’t talk about women’s narratives in local cinema without mentioning director Marilou Diaz-Abaya and screenwriter Ricky Lee’s 1982 film “Moral.” It stars Sandy Andolong, Lorna Tolentino, Gina Alajar, and Anna Marin as college friends who are trying to navigate adulthood during a time of changing morals. It’s still pretty progressive by today’s standards and its layered portraits of Filipino women still hold up. Sylvia (Andolong) is still in love with her ex-husband who left her for a male go-go dancer. Joey (Tolentino) is addicted to drugs and casual sex but what she really wants is to be with a certain student activist. Kathy (Alajar) is a mediocre aspiring singer who’s willing to go through unpleasant lengths for her dream. Maritess (Marin) was initially content with being a simple housewife but as her marriage turns sour, she begins to rethink her decision. Will they be brave enough to choose a better life for themselves?  Emma Seligman’s directorial debut film “Shiva Baby” has a juicy premise. Rachel Sennott plays college student Danielle, who has an awkward encounter with her sugar daddy, his wife, and her ex-girlfriend at a Jewish funeral service that she’s attending with her parents. As black comedies go, Danielle gets into increasingly nerve-wracking situations as lies surface and pressure from family members pile on. If you’re looking for motivation to get out of a slightly beneficial but possibly unhealthy secret arrangement, this might help.  Having generational trauma as its main antagonist makes “Encanto” instantly an interesting addition to Disney’s animated lineup. Stephanie Beatriz voices Mirabel, the only member of the extraordinary Madrigal family who wasn’t able to attain magical abilities. Desperate to prove that she’s special too, Mirabel jumps at the chance to play savior when a threat to their family’s powers looms. While on her mission, Mirabel soon realizes that the rest of her family are similarly weighed down by matriarch Abuela Alma’s high expectations. Alma isn’t without demons (in the form of colonial settlers) of her own. Will their family be able to heal and move forward?  I wasn’t sure whether the coming-of-age dramedy fit this list because the Rossi family’s too cool, but I’m including it because it *is* about turning a new leaf during a hard time. It follows the story of Ruby, a hearing Child of Deaf Adults (CODA), who’s caught between helping her family’s new fishing business and pursuing singing in a faraway college. She feels guilty for the possibility of relinquishing her role as her family’s longtime sign language interpreter and pursuing something that she feels she might not be able to share with her family. Will she give up her dream? Deaf actors Daniel Durant, Troy Kotsur, and Oscar-winner Marlee Matlin play Ruby’s family members and they are a joy to behold. Matlin spills that a number of Kotsur’s hilarious ASL scenes were improvised. About 40% of the film’s script is in sign language and the cast’s performances highlight the importance of deaf casting. Although the film has received both praise and criticism, it’s a step in the right direction for more diverse film narratives.  Here’s another animated film on the list. Studio Ghibli’s “Only Yesterday” is about corporate slave Taeko Okajima’s sabbatical to the Yamagata Prefecture—a trip that has her remembering her fifth grade year. During her stay as a farmhand, she starts to reconsider the way she’s been living her life. Does she really want to go back to the solitude she feels in Tokyo? It’s a very sentimental movie that will have you inspecting your own childhood memories and whether you’ve chosen your own happiness.

25 recommended reads to start 2022,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/394871/25-recommended-reads-to-start-2022/,"04:34 PM January 09, 2022","There’s no denying that at our lowest during the past two years, it was books which kept us faithful company. The amazing thing is that though our lives have not completely normalized yet, the Philippine publishing industry has bravely continued on, with much resilience and optimism. Consider these 2021 releases, 25 books representing different genres and 16 publishers, offering all of us a promising reading year. What a delight to see the year’s harvest, with something for every reading mood and taste—and knowing that there are many more that escaped my scrutiny.  That endearingly mischievous-looking, curly-haired youngster on the cover has an intriguing teaser of an opening line: “Mayroon akong lihim. Ayaw ko munang sabihin.” He then shows how he loves to kendeng here, there and everywhere else at home. To top it all, he has the most fun when he puts on his crown and his cape, deliriously happy with his continuing kendeng. Suddenly, the earlier happy hues of pastels darken and convey tension. His father has arrived from work and his displeasure is shown with the youngster sitting it out in a dark corner, with neither his crown nor his cape. The very sound of the word kendeng makes one smile, for no English translation of it being an exaggerated swing of the hips here and there can quite capture the nuances of the action. What a successful picture book whose delightful illustrations and 41 simple words manage to convey so much. A feat so rare and so difficult to achieve.  These are not your typical board books for beginning readers. There is humor even as one learns such basic information. The choices of objects to count are outrageous: three for triple chins, four eyes with spectacles on, five farts, nine fingers, 10 tattoos on a woman’s leg. One is led to know the parts of the body following the flight of the mosquito as it hovers around different characters, from the head of a little girl to the neck of a matron to someone’s fat stomach all the way to a skinny man’s feet. These Adarna titles in bold colors are good reminders that we all love and need humorous books—with the values to be learned.  This is the latest book in the popular medical science series of pediatrician Luis P. Gatmaitan, who has made childhood illnesses and ailments better understood by the public, both young and old. The story is told from the point of view of Covidoom, whom we meet as he is sneezed out by someone without a mask. And so his journey begins as he enters the nose of Jonas, who was breathing heavily as he was practicing his TikTok dance steps. His final entry into the lungs was not easy but possible through his spikes, which act like keys to the lung cells. This children’s book is a welcome addition to the growing body of coronavirus literature for young readers. Interesting to see the various approaches of different authors on the topic, the better for different learning styles.  How effectively the narrative captures in verse the homecoming experience of the balikbayan granddaughter visiting the “land Mama left long ago.” Her first experiences upon arrival at the airport are familiar: “Sticky wet heat puffs up my hair,” the babel of voices in conversation, “Words flood my ears in Filipino and Ilokano,/ And the sounds of Bikol mixed with Cebuano.” Her family awaits the release of the ubiquitous balikbayan box “filled with corned beef, SPAM,/ Chocolate, and socks!” all properly labeled for family members. The crowd of well-wishers parts as they move outside to their vehicle and her Tito Jun introduces them to the Manila traffic: “It takes courage to drive!” But there is so much to love in the country. She meets her cousins, with funny names like Jeboy and Chin-Chin, and they all “sniff-kiss” their hellos. She is beyond belief—can there really be all 22 of them? It is an endearing scene when she finally meets her lola, she who writes yearly, always signing, “From Manila with love.” The visit ends but not without “culture and history” now a part of the narrator whose Filipino part of her can never be forgotten. It is a newly discovered connection deep in her heart.  “Niña Inocente” is the story of an unsuspecting 8-year-old who spends most of her waking hours role-playing on the computer. One day, she is enticed to play another kind of role-playing game that promised her easy cash just by following simple directions, like removing her clothes, dancing and touching a naked boy in the same room—as ordered by a man smiling on the screen. Niña felt “she had been transported to a strange new world. But she was confused …” She had unwittingly become a victim of online sexual exploitation of children (Osec)—all the more despicable because an adult had lured her into this. The book includes helpful information on Osec for parents, guardians and caregivers, where to report cases and internet safety tips for children. Augie Rivera is an award-winning children’s book author and a television writer who has written on similar sensitive issues in his previous books: incest in “Ang Lihim ni Lea” and the anguish of martial law detention in “Isang Harding Papel.”  This is a children’s book with simple sentences and attractive illustrations for the beginning reader which successfully conveys the concept of a community pantry. It is harvest time and the fruit trees are ready for picking. The text in Filipino expresses it better: “Masipag ang kaimito. Mabunga ang makopa.” There are many blessings from the land to be picked, to be enjoyed, to be shared. Nanay wears her mask and goes off somewhere, where it is not considered safe for children. There she offers her pickings, “We have too much. Please share this.” She in turn takes what she needs from the pantry as a surprise for her children eagerly awaiting her return. The community pantry’s slogan of “Magbigay ayon sa kakayahan/ Kumuha ayon sa panggailangan” is described in such concrete terms. It also honors all the founders of community pantries in the country, beginning with the one on Maginhawa Street.  If you think that title is so apt a description of the coronavirus, consider the onomatopoeic title Eugene Y. Evasco has chosen for the Filipino text: “Tultulis, Turturok at Tuktusok.” This is a well-researched and informative book on the virus, yet written in such friendly and unintimidating language that only a seasoned writer of children’s books and now Colorado-based science writer Natasha Vizcarra can do with such ease. Vizcarra should be a familiar name to Inquirer readers, especially since she edited the Junior Inquirer for seven years. It follows the fully masked Tita Baby’s jeepney ride one day. The story begins, “It began with a sneeze. Or two. Or three.” The scientific explanations are lightened with how Tita Baby strictly follows recommended safety protocols. A helpful and attractively illustrated science book for parents and teachers as well, for after the narrative are the following sections: COVID Toolbox for Parents, which includes a Glossary that explains Big Words; Questions Kids Might Ask; Questions to Ask your Kids; Bibliography; and Know More About the Coronavirus. And through all this, the humble reminder that there are many things mysterious about the coronavirus awaiting more research.  “Bikolnon Biography Series” documents the lives and contributions of outstanding Bikolanos to make them better known and appreciated by the youth of Bikol. There is special interest in religious leader and community development organizer Sr. Felicitas de Lima’s book because her biography was written by Sen. Leila de Lima from her detention cell in Crame. The senator writes from her intimate relationship with Sister Itat, or Ma Helen, as her nephews and nieces call her. Her aunt is recognized for Fatima Center for abandoned children that Sister Itat runs, on a parcel of land in Iriga, donated by her landed family. Ma Helen is known in the family as a modern-day Robin Hood because she is described as “adroitly effective in soliciting help from the more privileged” to help the less privileged. The senator’s account turns emotional when she recounts Ma Helen’s reaction when she would visit De Lima in Crame. She would be in tears and say indignantly in Bikol, “What have they done to you?”  Two longtime colleagues, as De La Salle graduate school of business professors and newspaper columnists, compile their essays on topics they feel strongly about, yet do not always agree on: artificial intelligence, social responsibility, climate change, globalization, geopolitics and their impact on business ethics, social justice and the future of mankind on planet earth. The points of disagreement should make for more interesting reading for, as Dr. Elfren S. Cruz writes, “The best way to test your ideas is to discuss them with someone who does not agree with you.” Dr. Benito L. Teehankee has always advocated for the social role of businesses and how business leaders can enhance their influence on society as early as his first column in 2005, yet is now hopeful about the “unfulfilled promise of business to spread the benefits of capitalism.”  How can one miss with an intriguing title like that? Not that the byline of an award-winning poet, essayist and retired judge is not enough of a draw in itself. This collection of 170 personal essays are to be savored, read leisurely and reflected on. Each invites the reader to engage in self-reflection, following the author intent on seeing beyond the obvious, the apparent, and “bypass the passing character of the physical world.” Because he is a poet, there are essays devoted to the craft and familiar lines of poetry. How he links his everyday observations to the Bible is a delightful segue to meditation.  This book puts together two collections of poetry by Katigbak-Lacuesta, the author of four other poetry books. “Burning Houses” dwells on loss, while “Hush Harbor” is on the “love and power dynamics between men and women, colonizer and colonized.” What is interesting in this collection is the quotes and the background information the poet provides for most of the poems, crediting the lines or the writers who have inspired their writing.  The author, former professor of literature (in the spirit of transparency, let it be known that Asuncion “Sony” David Maramba was my English professor at St. Scholastica’s a lifetime ago), and theology and newspaper columnist, has long been talking of retirement, but there’s no stopping her from writing. Just look at how she is marking her 89th year, with yet another book—a true example of a writer never being able to stop what she enjoys indulging in. What makes this even more amazing is that to this day, she uses neither the computer nor Gmail. Maramba introduces the book as “my fourth and last anthology,” a collection of essays written in her 80s. Does anyone believe her? Confessing to taking liberties with this her “last hurrah,” she departs from the usual impersonal tone of op-ed pieces and weaves autobiographical details in them. She has every right to do so, making this an important gift of remembering for the younger generation. What an excellent model Maramba is for all seniors who are thus enjoined to continue pursuing their passions.  This is the second of three volumes, the last still awaiting completion and the first volume, covering the years from 1908 to 1943, released in early 2020. This monumental work began, or rather, continued as an abandoned and forgotten project in 2016 when then chancellor Michael Tan was informed of “a treasure trove of notes and documents on the UP’s history” kept in storage in the university’s Main Library. This was meant for a book project that then UP president Francisco Nemenzo envisioned to be part of the university’s centenary commemoration in 2008. Each volume is structured within the context of each university president’s term and made richer through the voices of the diverse UP community through the years, with attempts to include the regional units in Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao. The general editor Cruz-Lucero, one of the writers of the original project, writes that though the six UP presidents in each volume “serve as the anchor for the stories that compose the UP community’s university experience,’’ the chapters are not entirely about them. This history leaves no stone unturned, with its exhaustive research. I do not have UP ties, but my most interesting vintage finds were Ceferino Joker P. Arroyo’s yearbook photo as a 1952 law graduate and a photo of a dear uncle, plastic surgeon Dr. Clemente O. Sta. Romana, who topped the medical board exam in 1952.  What an attractive book on our national hero who left us, as public historian and principal authority on Rizal, Ambeth R. Ocampo, often points out, 26 volumes of writings that remain unread and unappreciated. That does seem like another tragedy for our martyred hero. This new edition of a largely unknown 1996 biography by Nick Joaquin for the National Centennial Commission is a welcome release as it brings back to life the Rizal persona we all ought to know better through Joaquin’s exemplary narration. It is a boon to students and school libraries whose Rizal collection does the hero such a disservice. Much has been written about Rizal, but in ways students hardly find memorable. The 35 chapters focus on many of life’s circumstances and setbacks that Rizal had to overcome to become the hero we know him to be. These should be especially relevant to the students, as most of the chapters focus on Rizal’s youth. Interesting are the notes that Ocampo has added to Joaquin’s narration, in a tone and manner that only he can manage, knowing Rizal all too well.  This collection of 10 short stories by Alvin Yapan in a handy-sized edition, originally written and highly lauded in Filipino, comes to English readers as a precious gift by talented translator, poet and editor, the late Randy M. Bustamante. It is fortunate that Bustamante has left us with this translation, something that Alvin Yapan values, as it is much more than the already complex task of mere translating. Yapan credits Bustamante “for his sensitivity to my original stories in Filipino, their religious and cultural contexts, and the grace with which he turned them into his own stories in English.”  This handsomely produced coffee-table book is a passion project of a proud daughter of Lingayen who has painstakingly researched historical vignettes on the capital of Pangasinan for her target audience, the millennials and the generations to come, that they may be imbued with a special pride for their hometown. By knowing more about their history, culture and tradition, she hopes that efforts at preserving local culture are sustained. In her introduction, Arabela Ventenilla Arcinue points out that she deliberately wrote in a conversational and informal style rather than in the manner of scholars to reach a wider audience. Quite aptly, she discovered that “Lingayën,” with an umlaut, literally means “to look back,” a process she herself has found pleasurable and most gratifying. It has emerged as a precious and impressive volume, lavishly illustrated with over 600 photographs collected from treasured albums of old families, relatives and friends.  This novel was first published in 2000 after it won the Philippine Centennial Literary Award in 1998. Set against the backdrop of the Spanish-American War and the war between the United States and the Philippines, it follows the life of a leader of the millenarian movement in the country, Dionisio Magbuelas. It was a time of many upheavals in the country, and the novel traces the impact of these on several characters “whose destinies are altered by a nation about to be born, and its repercussions which linger to this day.” Thus, the continuing relevance of this novel, now released as a 20th anniversary edition with cover art by BenCab. It has been extensively revised and includes new passages.  This is not the first Filipino dictionary that Virgilio S. Almario has spearheaded. Previous editions in 2001 and 2010 with UP have long been out of print—and perhaps happily so, because given many developments, they may not be 100-percent accurate anymore. Almario points out that the use of “Pambansang” in this edition’s title is a change learned from previous omissions—the inclusion of words from Philippine languages, showing us the origin of our dynamic, growing language and words from English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, etc. which have become part of today’s Filipino. It also seeks to promote a more standardized usage of the language using the orthography developed by Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino since 2013. Throughout its 1,148 pages—yes, it has been called a doorstop—we find words like “Om” from Hinduism, “palokpók” from Sinaunang Tagalog, “ragout” from French, “gáyho” from Hiligaynon. Not for bedtime reading, but an important resource to have around.  What merits the reissue of a book 40 years after its publication, in fact, the third edition? The book is recognized as one of the most important books on Southeast Asian history, and established James Francis Warren’s reputation as a pioneering and innovative social historian. It is said to have created the Sulu Zone, beyond the geographical area controlled by the sultanate. It presented this world not as a “decaying backwater” but a thriving area that benefited from the growth of the China trade, a source of products sought in China. More important, the book tells the stories of the slave raiders and the captives and the slaves, beyond their usual portayals in written records. Warren is professor emeritus of Southeast Asian Modern History at Murdoch University. His first encounter with the Sulu Zone was 54 years ago, when he and his wife, then newly married, were living on the east coast of North Borneo as Peace Corps volunteers. Spending some time in a water village, he became interested in the history of the Sulu Zone with the “rapid abandonment of sea nomadism.”  This is a special edition of the book that was released a year earlier—and received the highest praise from reviewers and readers who spoke of the way seasoned journalist and fictionist Criselda Yabes told the story of a tragic battle like it were a thriller on Netflix. Except that Yabes was not weaving tales about the battle. This larger edition with detailed charts and maps to accompany the eyewitness accounts also uses a larger and more readable font. A chapter ends this way: “So, in the wee hours of the morning of June 1, as darkness was about to meet dawn, Azrael and his men crossed back on the bridge, back to where they came from, quietly, their boots treading lightly so that the enemy would not hear them. They marched back to the camp in the chilling atmosphere of darkness, in a mysterious city that greets the day with a fog.”  What began as an attempt to keep poetry and the spoken word alive during the early months of the pandemic has been sustained and has now been turned into a valuable, first-of-a-kind resource book that teachers and poetry lovers can enjoy. Twenty-seven poets and 15 artists who performed the poetry are featured in the collection. Adding luster to “Himati” (a word that has become part of our vocabulary, thanks to the series, and meaning “to think deeply”) is the participation of theater and entertainment personalities like Jaime Fabregas, Piolo Pascual, Max Eigenmann, Marc delaCruz, Lui Quiambao Manansala, Bon Vibar and Christian Bables. This poetry experiment-publication speaks of Naga as a cultural hub in the country.  After more than 20 books and several awards, Abrera decided to try his hand at self-publishing—in full color yet. Because his books are coveted, buying the books online was a tough gambling game. One had to be online at the right hour, the right time. But finally getting the book was worth the wait as it bore the artist’s signature in gold. As he explains in his intro (“Paunang Kunot Noo”), Bertong was born because a week-long comic strip had to be produced in a rush under so much pressure from other deadlines. When life normalized, the artist “killed” Bertong, until he received many messages protesting the demise, demanding why he had to be created, only to have such a short life. Thus, Bertong’s own compilation independent of the well-known “Kikomachine Komix” series. And so we follow Bertong as he goes through life’s trials brought about by cruel teachers, school misadventures and other mishaps. So amusing to read Bertong’s reactions from “Rise viciously into soulful abyss” to “By the power of the ninth power of badtripness, I summon thee.”  Well-known arts critic Pablo A. Tariman rediscovered poetry during the pandemic, a good 50 years after his first poem appeared in print. The responses to his near-daily poems posted on social media encouraged him to collect these into his first book. It turned out that his personal reactions to what was going on around him were similarly felt by his readers, “truly capturing the nation’s heartbreak.” How encouraging for him to have his poem “Ode to the Frontliners” inscribed on a marker dedicated to health workers in Pasig. It reads, “It is murder most foul/ When country folk are deprived/ Of health care that they badly need …” It speaks of lives they have extended and giving patients “the last warm moments … before their flight into the stars.” The first poem in the collection says, “You have to strip naked/ To write the poem/ In your mind./ You have to face/ The joy of living/ And the horrors/That come with it.” The biggest horror to the reader is the loss of his poet daughter Kerima, 42, to gunshot wounds in a sugarcane plantation in Negros Occidental. He dedicates a special section of five poems to her, “Odes to My Second Daughter.” In anticipation of claiming her remains, Tariman poignantly writes, “I think of her now/ Lifeless on a cold cement floor,/ Waiting for her father and son/ To claim her/ And share/ A last hug.”  This is a collection of personal narratives of former Jesuits, with tributes to departed companions highlighting shared experiences based on their common background as members of the Society of Jesus. What emerges is that even as secular members today, they continue to devote their lives to service of others and “finding God in all things.”This is timed as a 2021 release to coincide with the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the conversion of Iñigo de Loyola, soldier-saint and founder of the society.

Stark Fitness opens its first-ever branch in SM Megamall,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/394688/stark-fitness-opens-its-first-ever-branch-in-sm-megamall/,"02:04 PM January 04, 2022","Manila, Philippines (December 20, 2021) — In the Philippines, the fitness industry has been widely considered as one of the growing industries before the pandemic. Although the current health crisis has drastically affected the said industry, the local fitness landscape can still be considered a competitive market. In nearly two years of the community quarantine, home fitness has become one of the most effective outlets for some Filipinos. As the work-from-home setup has been significantly normalized, people have been looking for ways on how to keep their physical and mental well-being in good shape.

Aspirations to guide your 2022 resolutions,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/394383/aspirations-to-guide-your-2022-resolutions/,"10:05 PM December 31, 2021","A new year is a great opportunity to set goals. I do believe that we have to change our mindset when it comes to resolutions. Otherwise, you end up doing well for the first few weeks, until you hit a slump that leads to a downward spiral. When it comes to creating better habits, always come from a place of love. Forgive yourself often and celebrate your victories, no matter how small they are. In 2022, I do believe we must all aspire for a positive mindset. But, of course, not the superficial kind. A positive mind balances what’s happening in front of you and involves working on the things you can control. It is connected to having healthy expectations. Creating reasonable expectations veers away from the need for perfection. Once you hold yourself to a particular standard of perfection, it leads only to misery. This is true not just in a broader sense, but also when it comes to beauty. Embrace your looks and understand that aging isn’t something to fear or erase. The changes that age brings bear witness to the life you’ve lived and to the experiences you’ve collected. For example, I know that being in the sun causes more wrinkles and sunspots. But being in the sun also means beach trips, walks in the morning and even just the daily errands that make for a full life. Instead of fearing the damage the sun gives, I just put on my sunblock and go on and enjoy as much as I can. As I age, I also realize the value of more realistic role models. It’s not about Photoshop. It’s about the uniqueness we all have that makes us who we are. If anything, we’ve learned not to aspire to look like someone on our feed. We must learn to love the best version of ourselves and to subscribe to our own standard of beauty. After all, can you imagine how boring it would be if we all looked alike? In that vein, don’t compromise the most important factors of skin care. Cleaning and sun protection are nonnegotiable, and are always the foundation of any routine. A lot of resolutions will always include exercise. This is important, but always at a pace that is sustainable. Ten minutes every day is better than one big day every so often. In between, be conscientious of your food. This doesn’t have to be drastic as well. What’s more important is that it is a daily factor. It’s what you do every day that counts, not what you do once in a while. Most important, make rest a priority. Ironically, one should put effort into setting aside time to really get good sleep. On top of that, unwinding and detaching from your screens helps with your wellness physically and mentally. It is also tied up to how saying “no” to certain plans or activities is simply learning to put yourself first before you can give your best to others. Happy 2022!

How to go green and still have a merry Christmas,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/393867/how-to-go-green-and-still-have-a-merry-christmas/,"04:39 PM December 20, 2021","Still not through your Christmas gift list? Why not consider giving experiential presents like memberships, a spa package or cooking lessons for a cheery and eco-friendly Christmas? “The first thing that comes to mind when you think of the holidays, it’s always about getting people gifts. It’s the season of giving, but it also means it’s a season of a lot of consuming, like buying certain products,” said Marian Ledesma, Zero Waste campaigner of Greenpeace in Southeast Asia. In fact, nongovernmental organization Ecowaste Coalition came up with the term “holitrash”—a portmanteau of the words “holiday” and “trash”—in reference to the waste that ends up in the dump during the Yuletide season. Christmas is that time of the year when plastic and food waste are at an all-time high. From excessive bubble wraps and plastic packaging from e-commerce sites, to paper bags from brick-and-mortar stores, a lot of plastic waste is headed to the bins during the holidays, said Ecowaste Coalition national coordinator Aileen Lucero. So how does one celebrate the holidays in a more sustainable way—especially during a pandemic, when waste has increased due to the necessary use of protective equipment and the rise of online shopping? Ledesma said that DIY, or making gifts, is one eco-friendly practice. It’s personal, it reduces consumption and so many materials can be upcycled to make the perfect and unique gift. Greenpeace also encourages giving experiential gifts. “They’re this awesome concept because they don’t encourage consumption of material goods. But you can sort of provide a different memory or a great skill or experience to the person that you’re gifting to,” she added. Baking cookies or cakes or even singing songs to loved ones can be a good intangible gift, Ledesma said. More importantly, it’s about spending quality time with loved ones after a long series of lockdowns. For those who are opting for retail, both organizations encourage buying locally made products. Bring reusable bags when shopping and don’t forget to reuse wrapping papers and old bags. When it comes to “noche buena,” Lucero said it’s important to buy local and shop at zero-waste stores. She clarified that zero-waste stores also include the palengke, because the produce is not wrapped in plastic unlike in groceries. Local food also has less carbon emissions, Ledesma added, because the products are grown in a more ecological way. And it’s not just the environment that benefits from shopping at the market. “You’re also supporting farmers and supporting the local food system in the Philippines,” Ledesma said. Growing one’s own food is also a good practice, and more people started doing it in the beginning of the pandemic. And while Filipinos love their lechon or Christmas ham on their spread, Ledesma recommended having plant-based dishes on the noche buena spread. During the New Year’s Eve festivities, Lucero said people should do away with firecrackers, which are harmful to the environment, to one’s health and to animals. “It’s better to use alternative merry noisemakers—amp up the radio, karaoke, bang kitchen pots and pans, make homemade maracas using PET bottles and coins or stones,” she said. These improvised merrymakers are also safe, unlike firecrackers that may cause serious injuries. For decorations, Lucero noted that Christmas ornaments should be cleaned and stored properly after the festivities to make sure they can be reused for a long time. It’s not just Earth-friendly but also budget-friendly. But it’s not just consumers who should be mindful of the trash during holidays. Lucero said store owners should do away with Styrofoam or plastic packaging for food and instead use reusable containers to prevent waste. Ledesma added that aside from the social movement toward sustainable practices, the government and businesses should play their role to promote a circular economy.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
The most thoughtful gifts for yourself,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/393493/the-most-thoughtful-gifts-for-yourself/,"03:05 PM December 16, 2021","Luxurious things to make you feel pampered, loved and special  Never forget to reward yourself. One cannot give what one doesn’t have, after all. In the hustle of the season and in your search for presents for loved ones, it is paramount you also treat yourself to something you really want, or perhaps to something that will see you through the coming year. It will serve as a reminder that in our pursuit of achievements, taking time for yourself is paramount. This gift guide is meant to give you ideas on what gifts will help you feel pampered, loved and special. I will always suggest that the gift of skin care keeps on giving. Since it’s the holidays, I couldn’t think of a much better time to go for something luxe. Chanel Skincare offers L’Essence Fondamentale Sublimage and L’Extrait De Crème. Meant to be used as the third and fourth step in your skin-care routine after cleansing and toning, these two products harness the power of Chanel’s signature ingredient, Vanilla Planifolia. The L’Essence Fondamentale Sublimage is an exceptional serum that promises to tighten and tone the skin. It uses moisturizing hyaluronic acid and nourishing vegetal butter to give you that supple and radiant skin. L’Extrait De Crème promises to revitalize and protect the skin. After four weeks of consistent use, you will get skin that is more visibly nourished, smooth and plump. Once you have a good base, you’re ready to play with some makeup. I find that premium makeup never fails to brighten up my day and put me in a good mood. That’s a good investment to have to conquer the coming days and the new year. Once you have a good base, you’re ready to play with some makeup. I reach for the Nars Unwrapped Collection, their latest for the holidays. The pretty packaging is a delight on top of the trusted and no-fail product. You can’t go wrong with the Endless Orgasm Mini Set, which includes a mini Orgasm blush along with Afterglow Lip Balm in the matching shade. Honestly, you can get a full look with these two and a skin tint for that healthy glow. No matter what you’re doing, never underestimate the power of scent. Now is indeed the time to restock on your favorite one or to discover a new concoction. Art of Scent is a great place for this purpose with its curated collection of fragrances. A brand that might pique your fancy is Alexandre J. Their fragrances are displayed in bottles that mimic art and deserve a star place on your vanity. The Mandarine Sultane scent features the gardens of Alhambra with “the opulence of citrus, musk and jasmine.” When it comes to fashion, opt to elevate your basics and get something that you can use time and again. Balmain and its Philippine flagship store at The Shoppes at Solaire is the perfect place to find just that. You can pick up their iconic cotton logo T-shirt in a color of your preference. It will never fail to make a statement whatever the occasion and can be easily styled to your look. In 2022, we hope for more travel, with the utmost caution, whether it is for work or play. You will repeatedly thank yourself if you get something like the Tumi Continental Expandable 4-wheeled carry-on. It is made with recycled polycarbonate shell, making it lightweight and flexible, but hardworking. You get a lot of space and smooth, quiet wheels so you can catch the next flight without a hitch. The carry-on also shows off Tumi’s skill at adapting to our needs. The PROTX2 technology means that the lining has been treated with innovative antimicrobial coating to help prevent the growth of bacteria, mildew and mold that may cause fabric odor on its surface. Chanel and Nars are available at Rustan’s The Beauty Source. Tumi is at Greenbelt 5. Visit riarecommends.com  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

The word that defines my 2021,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/393090/the-word-that-defines-my-2021/,"12:39 PM December 11, 2021"," “In order to love who you are, you cannot hate the experiences that shaped you.” —Andrea Dykstra As 2021 comes to a close, I think about a word that defines this year for me personally. Although 2021 has been quite challenging and life-altering, my word would be “self-love.” At the intimate birthday party of dear friend Anton San Diego, I asked the guests the single word that best describes 2021 to them. Lots of words like “possibilities,” “resilience,” “health,” “gratitude,” “horizon” and “faith” were thrown in, and we all agreed with one another’s individual sharing. Our gracious host, Cris Albert, cheered for Anton and thanked him for including her in Tatler Philippines’ Asia’s Most Influential List. She also jokingly shared her word for the year—”Fila.” It was indeed a wonderful night of friendship, gratefulness and celebration of life. After months of being on strict social confinement, being able to enjoy some laughter and cheers was literally a breath of fresh air. The delightful outdoor setup of Manila House made everyone feel safer and secure. Self-love can mean something different for each person, since we all have a different concept of caring for ourselves. As a baseline, self-love means having a high regard for your own well-being and happiness. Self-love means taking care of our own needs and not sacrificing our well-being to please others. Self-love means not settling for less than what we deserve. Prioritizing our physical, emotional and mental well-being is not about being selfish or self-centered. It is merely accepting oneself with no judgment and being true to yourself and everything that you are at this very moment. Because of this dreadful pandemic, self-love is also about self-care. To practice self-care, we need to go back to the basics of listening to our bodies and living a healthier lifestyle through exercise and proper nutrition. I have learned the value of supplements like Usana to aid in my journey to wellness. There are several avenues to promoting self-love. Becoming mindful of what we feel and want is critical in this goal. By staying focused on our personal needs and desires of the heart, we become more aware of the positive energy we can create and turn away from automatic behavior patterns that trigger us to self-destruction. By continuously practicing self-love daily through healthy activities, like sound nutrition, exercise, proper sleep, intimacy and healthy social interactions, we gain so much awareness and growth. We need to feed our soul every day with love and compassion for ourselves so we can then share these with others. We can better handle stress, face and overcome challenges, maintain and build relationships, and recover from difficulties and setbacks. No one can tell you that you are too big as a person and blame you for their insecurities. With a greater sense of meaning and purpose, we are able to enjoy life, deal with stress and bounce back from adversity. Even if we experience disappointment, loss or unwanted change, we have the armor of resilience to overcome all. There are numerous ways to gain contentment. Partake in activities that make you feel happy and productive and challenge your creativity. Whether through drawing, taking an exercise class, going out to dinner with friends or caring for a pet, spending quality time with those who matter to you can make you feel good. The meaning and purpose derived from helping others or the community can enrich and expand your life—and make you happier. There’s no limit to the individual and group volunteer opportunities you can explore. Schools, places of worship, nonprofits and charitable organizations of all sorts depend on volunteers for help in any capacity. One such project was the successful artistic Christmas auction by Tatler Philippines and Shangri-La at The Fort Manila, which was held via a private event on Zoom. Five generous and talented creatives breathed life into 4-foot-tall nutcracker statues, painting and decorating according to each of their own tastes. Elena Coyiuto, Tracie Anglo Dizon, Rajo Laurel, Bea Valdes and Tim Yap created their own artistic expression of the nutcracker soldier for auction. Christmas nutcracker soldiers are decorative nutcracker statues, most commonly made to resemble a toy soldier. It was said that in German tradition, the dolls are symbols of good luck, frightening away malevolent spirits and protecting your home. The nutcracker soldier originates from late 17th-century Germany. To reach out and make a tangible difference as we usher in the holidays, the proceeds of the auction were used to fund noche buena hampers which will be delivered by Shangri-La at The Fort’s cheeky elves to Kythe Foundation Inc.’s children. Kythe is a nonprofit, nonstock organization aimed toward improving the quality of life of children undergoing treatment for cancer and other chronic illness. The foundation supports over 18,000 children every year. Tatler Philippines’ Irene Martel-Francisco was so overwhelmed by the generous bidders. All went for much more than expected. Winning bidders included Butch Campos who got Rajo’s nutcracker, Lana Faith Johnson who won Tim’s nutcracker, and Paolo and Cristina Martel who got Bea’s nutcracker. Brian Poe Llamanzares got Elena’s creation, and Alelee Andanar won Tracie’s. If one grows up without any models for self-love or anyone who talked about the importance of being good to oneself, we may question its value. We may more likely tolerate abuse or mistreatment from others. Because of a lack of self-love, we neglect our own feelings and make wrong decisions that are harmful for our own best interest. Self-love is the foundation that allows us to be assertive, set boundaries and create healthy relationships with others, practice self-care, pursue our interests and goals, and feel proud of who we are. It is about respect. So for the remainder of 2021, I will love myself so I can give more love to all who touch my soul! Follow @seaprincess888 on Instagram.      CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Paving the path to thankfulness,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/392177/paving-the-path-to-thankfulness/,"07:27 PM December 01, 2021","This Christmas, emphasize love in all its forms “Be thankful for what you have; you’ll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don’t have, you will never, ever have enough.” —Oprah Winfrey Gratitude is like shopping and getting a GWP—Gift With Purchase. When we share kindness and gratefulness, we automatically receive a gift of feeling good. As a Thanksgiving tradition, our family shares with one another what key blessings we are thankful for. With resounding praise, thanks for good health was top of mind. Most of us were just grateful to be alive and healthy. Equally important in our “gratitude list” was the gift and love of family. Whether the challenge is mental confusion, emotional turmoil or physical pain, we know we can always rely on God’s strength and divine intervention. Despite the long road to recovery, we could just surrender in prayer and let God work His wonders. Gratefulness hinges on our willingness to accept God’s will over our own. Hard as it may be sometimes, there is true wisdom in the saying, “Do your best and let God do the rest.” This year, my story of God’s faithfulness to aid my life’s challenges was so evident in my sharing at the Thanksgiving dinner of our Africa travel gang TropAfrica at Cirkulo Restaurant. Hosted by our fave restaurateur Malu Gamboa-Lindo, the sumptuous turkey dinner was filled with gratefulness to God for walking beside us during a health issue or the loss of a loved one. For God remains steadfast when we are lonely, desperate and brokenhearted. Even if the storm is still raging, we feel His presence. Everyone has different family traditions, but we all encounter the storms of life. Harsh and threatening as they seem at first, storms have the ability to pave a unique path to thankfulness. In the storms of life, God is our only hope. His faithfulness and His goodness are present even during the darkest storm. It might not happen immediately, but our faith grows as we cling to Him. We are grateful not only for the joys of restored health and overcoming grief, but for the sorrows that brought us to a place of utter dependence on Jesus. I try to cultivate a sense of abundance within myself, and I try to help those in need, whether family members or friends having a hard time or strangers around the world who need food and shelter. It’s not a perfect solution to life, but as far as I can tell, it’s the best we can do if we want to be truly human. With a grateful heart, I flew to beautiful Boracay to join the special guests of Discovery Shores Boracay for the Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Thanks to their over-the-top personal service, Discovery Shores even arranged my flight and protocol permits to fly into the island. Landing at sea on the private Airtrav seaplane, I conveniently reached the resort without the hassle of waiting in the local airport. I was so lucky that our flight only had two passengers, as I had excess luggage of over 30 kilograms! Airtrav provides premiere seaplane chartered service straight to the shores of your favorite Philippine islands with a Cessna Grand Caravan Ex-Amphibian, which is the largest single-engine airplane produced by Cessna and seats eight passengers comfortably. It can take off and land safely on water—the Airtrav experience. It’s not every day that we get to fly high enough to maintain a panorama view of the Philippine archipelago and land on the bluest waters in the country. The seaplane can also be chartered for any occasion to any destination in the Philippines. As we learn to navigate a postpandemic world where preventive measures are the norm, Airtrav makes sure that the safety of both our crew and passengers remain top priority. In light of promoting local travel, Airtrav aspires to bring the Philippine islands closer to you while making significant positive contributions to local communities by taking all possible paths toward reviving tourism in the Philippines. For details, contact tel. 0927-3828883. To officially welcome Christmas at my favorite paradise resort, Discovery Shores Boracay held a tree lighting a few days ago with hotel manager Erwin Lopez, who invited all the resort guests to join the festivities. The resort’s 18-foot Christmas tree, located steps from the famous Boracay white beach, was lit up by family members of the resort owners. The tree is adorned with ornaments that showcase the multiple shades of the sea. The audience was serenaded with a medley of Christmas carols by the Boracay Ati Choir, who were dressed in lovely tribal attire. This festive season is “Love, Christmas.” It puts emphasis on love in all forms—love for family, love for life, love for big and small moments, love for friends, love for colleagues, love for the community, love for guests, love for country, love for food and love for nature. The theme also puts a special highlight on spreading the holiday spirit in the form of love letters—a traditional way of expressing love and appreciation to someone dear. Spend the holidays at Discovery Shores Boracay and fill your Christmas beach get-together with loving memories. The very first luxury hotel to open in Boracay Island, Discovery Shores Boracay is a timeless masterpiece sitting along the world-renowned white beach of Boracay. It offers 88 well-appointed suites and 11 indulgent spacious suites called Signature Suites that are sitting on an exclusive wing of the resort. (Tel. 7720-8888, email [email protected], discoveryshoresboracay.com.) As inspirational thinker Deepak Chopra shared, “Gratitude opens the door, the power, the wisdom, the creativity of the universe. You open the door through gratitude.” No matter the circumstances, there must always be hope to cling to and gratefulness to express. The secret to real happiness isn’t really a secret at all. It’s simply realizing the importance of counting blessings over burdens and understanding that gratitude has incredible power over grumbling.

Fortunately, Cardinal Santos Medical Center’s (CSMC) Cancer Center recognizes the importance of balancing the criticalities of COVID-19 and cancer treatment. Dr. John Mark Carabeo, a Radiation Oncologist and Cardinal Santos’ Training Officer and Assistant Chief of Section of Radiation Oncology, shares the new machine acquired by the hospital that allows them to elevate the level of cancer treatment offered to patients. The new machine – the Vital Beam Linear Accelerator – has enhanced cancer treatment and made it easier despite the pandemic, Dr. Carabeo said. “The Vital Beam offer widespread different radiation techniques that we could not offer before, such as stereotactic radiation therapy, image-guided radiation treatment, and volumetric arc radiation therapy.” With all the advanced techniques that the new Vital Beam machine offers, CSMC is now able to provide higher radiation doses effectively to patients without compromising the organs surrounding the targeted area during radiation. Respiratory Gating, for one, is a technique used on smaller tumors situated in mobile organs such as the lungs. It allows Oncologists to study the pattern of the patient’s respiration or breathing, and deliver the radiation dose to a specific respiratory phase of the patient so that only the tumor will receive a high dose of radiation. This technique decreases the potential detrimental toxicities to the patient by sparing normal tissues that are not delineated as targets, Dr. Carabeo explained. Receiving radiation therapy, however, is a cancer treatment option that requires expert evaluation of a number of factors such as the type of cancer, and the overall health and strength of the patient. “Determining the appropriateness of patient receiving radiation therapy usually takes a multidisciplinary team effort, wherein we discuss our cases and see if a patient will benefit from radiation therapy based on clinical guidelines, standard practice, performance status of the patient and the goals of treatment,” Dr. Carabeo said, adding that the number of sessions that the patient will need for radiation treatment will also depend on the histology of the tumor, their medical condition and the intention of treatment. The diagnosis of Cancer and the stigma of it being a terminal disease will always bring anxiety to patients but it is important, when in doubt, that one seeks proper medical guidance from experts in order to increase the chances of conquering cancer. With the new knowledge that Oncologists from Cardinal Santos Medical Center have acquired from numerous clinical trials and studies, new drugs, the advancement of technology and the team’s growing experience in cancer management, the future of Cancer treatment is bound to only get brighter.

‘Functional aging’ or how to delay the aging process,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391763/functional-aging-or-how-to-delay-the-aging-process/,"02:29 PM November 24, 2021","They were a picture of freedom of movement: The buck-naked elderly couple taking a high jump into the lake was a stark contrast to the way older people have been treated in this pandemic. “It’s as if they are fragile and that they’re going to die,” observed Martin Camara, chiropractic specialist and chief executive officer of Intercare Healthcare Systems. “The elderly have been separated from their families and friends, and their mobility would affect their happiness. Yet, the secret to a long, healthy life is to continue to be relevant, to be in contact with the communities and to engage with people. That was taken away during the lockdowns. Ironically, we lockdown to protect these people but, at the same time, it is causing them to suffer mentally and physically.” He cited studies that although people tend to lose their functionality over time and develop age-related diseases, these detriments can be abated. Camara is a proponent of functional aging. “For an older person, it is being able to continue to do the things that they enjoy,” he explained. People can delay the aging process and need not feel victimized by time or genetics by following a healthy lifestyle. He cited “The Biology of Belief” by American biologist Bruce Lipton who challenged the norm that our genetics control our functions and that diseases which are common within the family are passed on. The researcher maintained that we can control our health and the effects of our genetic blueprint with the power of positive thoughts and emotions. Another of Camara’s suggested readings is geneticist David Sinclair’s “Why We Age—and Why We Don’t Have To.” Sinclair researched on NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a coenzyme that controls many metabolic processes, and the proteins called sirtuins that respond to stress, cell metabolism and extension of lifespan. Boosting NAD+ levels and activating the sirtuins are antiaging interventions. Chiropractors likewise approach optimum health from how the body structure interacts with the nutrition and the environment and the emotional and mental state. “We look at the alignment of the spine and joints and how it affects the nerve flow, mobility, strength, stability and, ultimately, functionality. When you lose mobility, the metabolic health suffers and you become less active. If you have neck, back or ankle pains, you can’t do things you need to do,” explained Camara. Ray Dempsey, 70, said his success in life came with responsibility and stress. His body responded with a back problem and radiating pain. “You can’t put on your socks and shoes. You can’t brush your teeth. You’re miserable,” he recalled. A complete treatment plan has helped not only in returning the flexibility of his spine but also in mending his knees. His lifestyle changes include meditation, eating, exercise and chiropractic care. Sylvia Helovino, 68, used to do yoga and take long walks daily until a back problem encumbered her movements. She said chiropractic care, physical therapy and myofascial massage improved her well-being. Camara is one of the four international chiropractic specialists of the developmental group of health-care experts in the World Health Organization that is consolidating references for treatments of low back pain. He noted that spinal manipulation, which is one of the recommendations, is used in chiropractic practice. “Chiropractic adjustments (manipulating the joints) affect the activation of your prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain [that] controls the decision-making abilities, emotional health, immune function. It’s like fine-tuning the electrical systems in your spine and brain that allow your body to perform functions better. Studies show that aside from relief of common back and neck pains, patients reported sleeping better and thinking better. The better your spine is aligned, the better your nerve flow from the body to the brain and the brain to your body.” When a patient complains of a worn-out knee while the other is healthy, Camara doesn’t attribute the imbalance to aging. “It has to do with alignment and how you carried your weight and structure over time,“ he said. Most chiropractors are likewise advocates on how lifestyle change can have a major impact on aging. Poor sleep increases memory loss and brain deterioration, according to a research from the University of California Berkeley. “If you sleep for less than six hours a day, your immune system is depressed as much as 50 percent,” he added. “People feel sleepy but they ignore it. They still watch TV or read and stay up late. Set the air-conditioning at the highest tolerable temperature level. The lower the body temperature, the easier for the body to shut down and go to sleep.” A diet of whole and plant-based foods, avoiding refined sugars and processed foods not only reverse but also prevent metabolic and noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Moderate exercise or activities of 150 minutes a week or 30 minutes a day reduces major health risks and lengthens lifespan. Avoid stress which reduces the effectiveness of the immune system. “You could have a nutrient-dense, plant-based diet and the most expensive supplements. If you’re stressed, then you don’t digest and absorb the nutrients. The stress response is part of a mechanism that shuts down immune system,” explained Camara. For supplementation, the National Institutes of Health recommends omega-3 fatty acids which decrease the incidence of cardiovascular disease, which became prominent in this pandemic, and normalizes cholesterol levels and vitamins C and D and zinc. “Vitamin D is like a steroid hormone. It’s good for the muscles, the bones, immune system and combats inflammation. Echinacea can support the adaptive immune system. It’s a natural antiviral. Vitamin D can protect the elderly against acute respiratory distress,” he said. Meanwhile, Camara has been taking special antiaging supplements such as resveratrol, a chemical found in red wine that acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Then there are NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) and NR (nicotinamide riboside), forerunners to the NAD+ which extends the lifespan. While the NAD+ declines as one ages, NMN and NR supplements can boost its levels and enable optimum metabolism. Looking younger than 54, he noted that his gray hairs disappeared with these supplements. While the public is often reminded of these lifestyle recommendations, why do people still feel the effects of aging? “People don’t want to feel accountable. They would rather get an easy fix than do things that affect their health in a meaningful way,” said Camara. “People age differently. I could have a young 80-year-old or an old thirtysomething. When I see young people pointed to the wrong direction, they make excuses for avoiding golf or running because it hurts. Next thing, you move your bedroom on the ground floor because you are avoiding stairs. That is a losing strategy rather than gaining the functionality to continue to do things that one enjoys. At a certain age, if you don’t use our body, you lose its capacity,” he said. Ultimately, well-being is about making effort to get positive results. “Responsible people who take care of their health through diet, regular exercise, stress mitigation and adequate sleep do much better, not just with back pain, but also with general health and metabolic conditions. Even if they are afflicted with a disease related to family history, they are able to manage quite well,” he added.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
This time she may not make it,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391755/this-time-she-may-not-make-it/,"02:17 PM November 24, 2021","This time she may not make it. Although she has survived previous attacks, this time she is up against a particularly cruel and murderous one, launched on her in betrayal, by someone she thought she could trust. Here, veritably, is the unkindest cut of all. He had, after all, promised to protect her, in fact, professed publicly to be her champion forever. He is Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso. His victim: Arroceros Forest Park, the only mini-forest in his polluted city. On Nov. 13, a desperate post from cousin Regina “Ninit” Paterno on the Viber thread of our Winner Foundation, builders and caretakers of the forest since 1994: “I just witnessed the worst massacre of Arroceros Forest; all secondary trees and ground covers have been removed to give way to the concreting of what were the natural pathways on the forest floor. It was both shocking and heartbreaking. This has been the worst assault on the Forest yet. “City Hall has violated their assurances that the inner forest would not be touched in its so-called beautification plan. All the natural ponds, which served as drainage, have been covered with soil. The large man-made pond made by the late Mayor Alfredo Lim is underneath a structure now. “The Juvenal Sanso Garden, with indigenous trees he donated from our trade history with Mexico, has been cemented over. The concrete bench donated by National Artist Napoleon Abueva has been damaged; a part of it lies separated from the rest of it like a worthless chunk of concrete. You would have all cried had you seen it. “That day there were no birds singing.” The assault had been mounted stealthily, obviously kept deliberately from our foundation and its longtime partner associations of other environment protectors belonging to Save Arroceros Forest Park Movement, among them Catholic Women’s Club and Manila Doctors Hospital. We learned about the murder in the middle of it. Meanwhile, the mayor, now a presidential candidate, is busy going around making more promises. Indeed, he has the gall (as reported by Pia Ranada of Rappler in her own post) to promise “a massive reforestation with indigenous peoples if elected.” His lying mouth keeps going but his eyes remain conveniently blind to an ordinance (8607) he himself championed and has now violated himself, declaring “Arroceros Forest Park a permanent forest park, pursuant to Republic Act No. 5752, or the Municipal Forests and Watershed Act.” It constituted a declaration of love and concern for the environment—and we believed him; he cleaned the bay and city streets, and improved garbage collection, after all. But his attack on a forest more than cancels out all that; it makes him one of the worst enemies of the environment. If he had even the slightest understanding of the health benefits forests give people! Apparently he is so insensible he did not even feel the lowering of the temperature in and around the forest—if he happened to have been there at all. Even more surely, he has consequently driven away for good at least 25 species of birds that watchers have identified dwelling there. Our foundation had been waiting for the mayor’s answer to several requests for meetings, including one in a letter sent in behalf of the members of Save Arroceros Forest Park Movement—all of 54 members with 30 multisectoral private and public stakeholders, and 124,858 individual members, 58 percent of whom happen to be Manila voters. We had written the letter upon learning about his Arroceros “beautification plan.” We intended to bring to the meeting a forester and a taxonomist from the College of Forestry of the University of the Philippines and two doctors from Manila Doctors Hospital. Like any traditional politician, he chooses the people he meets with and limits their number, and often that does not include the likes of us. Soon enough, we realized no answer to our letter was coming. He had gone ahead with his beautification: He had killed a lot of trees. Our poor forest’s history, to be sure, has been one of run-ins with politicians. Upon succeeding Mayor Lim, Lito Atienza (a professional politician himself, for all intents and purposes; he has been vice mayor, mayor, a sitting congressman and now running for vice president), turned on the forest. He appropriated 800 square meters from its 2.1 hectares for the Department of Education, which could easily have been sited elsewhere. He butchered grown trees, in consequence destroying the natural cooling canopy they formed. We protested and were locked out of the forest. The forest itself was starved; water and power were disconnected. We sued Mayor Atienza. The case was dropped after Lim got reelected and the forest reopened and began to revive and recover on sustenance our foundation and our partners provided—money, labor, care. Parkgoers came again. Mayor Joseph Estrada eyed the forest, too, but saw it as real estate, and perhaps in attempt to devalue it in the eyes of the public, he first turned it into a partial junkyard. But Mayor Isko is putting to shame all those previous forest attackers. Imagine his potential environmental victims if he becomes president. Reclamations would be undertaken for dolomite beaches, and hard, hot concrete would replace cool, life-giving trees.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

Can an online cooking class teach you to be a culinary genius?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391560/can-an-online-cooking-class-teach-you-to-be-a-culinary-genius/,"02:52 PM November 19, 2021","The popularity of online classes has grown rapidly on a global scale since the onset of the pandemic. And now, in a world that has accepted the pandemic as—in some way or another—here to stay, some writers in other parts of the world are at the point of pitting online cooking classes against each other. Such writers point fingers at which courses are “worth your time or money or both.” Locally, this niche industry is still at its birthing stage. Businesses intrigued on meeting the new demand for online classes are quickly scared away by high barriers to entry: patchy internet connections, resurging road traffic, and the delivery of perishable goods in an archipelagic country, to name just a few. Enderun Extension, Enderun Colleges’ resource for continuing education, tries to meet this demand by offering a range of courses that cater to those keen on practicing culinary arts—be that in some fantastic global kitchen, or at home where you literally live with your harshest critics. In late October, I found myself—suddenly—a number in the demand for online culinary courses. As proud as I was of my omelette skills most adequately displayed on my single-burner electric stove, I simply wasn’t ready to make a dish whose name in Sanskrit meant “one hundred thousand” with reference to the number of possible ingredients that went into the dish. Much less was I equipped—neither with the equipment nor the experience—to chuck my best shot at a version prepared by chef See Cheong Yan with his over 20 years of experience in China, Switzerland, the Philippines, and a good many more destinations. I’d dare say that over the week of this course, chef See, the culinary head at Enderun Colleges, was going to be making a decent home cook—hardly a genius—out of an omelette-loving amateur. The course, which began on Oct. 22 and culminated on the morning of Oct. 30 with a Zoom meeting, falls under the banner of the Online Culinary eXperience platform. This was created in partnership with École Ducasse, an institution that has been operating as a training center in France for over 12 years, and which aims to craft a new generation of global culinary professionals. The goal of École Ducasse’s partnership with Enderun Colleges? Maintaining the “most adapted cooking program,” which offers “cutting-edge culinary principles and fundamental training, while also maintaining a healthy exchange of ideas,” the program description states. By extension, getting this writer to make a decent laksa. This home course comprised three steps: the delivery of the kit, the hands-on class via the internet-based portal, and the live discussion. The idea is that participants are quickly introduced to the neatly packaged and labeled ingredients, given the adequate online tools to prepare the meal, and then discuss their challenges with the chef—all the while gaining an understanding of the dishes’ origins and fine-tuning their cooking method. Propping the box open on my living room table, cool water began to roll off to the side as frozen ingredients began the hard work of getting back down to room temperature. The box teemed with little labeled wrappers. I brought out the nearest pair of scissors—at this point well aware they would be put to good use. I was overwhelmed. Greeted with two prospects, either giving into indefinite procrastination or moderated madness, I decided to proceed with the latter and open the link to the virtual learning management system. There, I found the recipe in both text and video format and chef See ready to begin the lesson at the click of a “play” button. It’s an exercise of fulfillment and comparison. The first sip of the stock, which was now gently bubbling in the pan, was a pleasant surprise. “Hmm, yes. I taste the chicken, the shellfish, and the paste I’d roughly put together.” (Note: The stock base comes pre-made.) Glancing eventually at the developments in chef See’s digital universe, I wince. “Why doesn’t mine look like that?” But this experience is shared. Later in the week, on a sunny Saturday morning, I joined my classmates as we gathered around the discussion of our chef-instructor for the day, chef Jose Gaerlan, a senior manager and chef instructor at Enderun Colleges with a vast web of experience that has taken him from Paris, where he worked with Groupe Alain Ducasse, to Lake Tahoe where he logged hours at the Hyatt Regency. Following introductions and confirming who had completed the recipe and who has yet to begin, the laksa discussion began. Quickly, participants began asking how chef See had managed to toast the laksa paste for the prescribed time without burning it and the purpose behind less familiar ingredients like candlenuts. We began to reflect on the range of cooking equipment we had each brought to the table and were instructed that candlenuts, much like cashews, help emulsify the paste. We then zoomed into the culminating event of the dish: poaching the chicken meatballs. “Delicious” was the word of the day at this point. I could easily relate. Challenged by more ingredients than I had seen in my fridge in recent years and a recipe divided into sections and more than 10 steps, I’d argue that this was a successful venture. The laksa was delightful. Sweet and rich, oily and savory. A warm hug after a long night spent hovering around cold beers and drinking a few too many of them too.  While I still cook eggs the same way, little things have changed. For one, I know how to poach a mean chicken meatball. I know that laksa is a dish of many thousands of iterations, each with its own family ties and history. And at this point in time, I know that my career is not slated to proceed into the kitchen. The platform developed and marketed by Enderun Colleges in partnership with École Ducasse is a local formula available if the full-time kitchen life is for you. With sessions teaching recipes from Hainanese chicken rice to crème brûlée and crêpes Suzette, there is something for almost any home cook to try—as a way of sharpening their skills and impressing their family members. Or taking the next step into a quickly adapting culinary industry.  This story was first published on fnbreport.ph  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

How I bounced back from my rotator cuff injury,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391512/how-i-bounced-back-from-my-rotator-cuff-injury/,"01:28 PM November 18, 2021","Photos by Ketut Subiyanto/Pexels and courtesy of Don Velasco I’ve had my fair share of injuries throughout my athletic career, from cuts and bruises to iliotibial band syndrome and lower back spasms. I’ve also had my fair share of aches and pains. But I’ve made it a point to learn from these injuries so I not only avoid them in the future but also impart wisdom and knowledge to my athletes. As I always say, learn from my mistakes and emulate my successes. The injury I’ll discuss in this article doesn’t get as much attention as it should: rotator cuff injuries. Not only is it common for athletes in general but recovery also takes a lot of time. Surprisingly, I injured my rotator cuff recently while doing house chores. I can rule out overuse injuries since my swim volume is nonexistent, my strength training is short and not that intense, and I haven’t been doing any other upper body exercises. To cut a long story short, a short, sudden movement done at an awkward angle and performed at the wrong time strained my rotator cuff. It’s been four weeks of rest, rehab, and medication but it still hasn’t healed 100 percent. So why does the rotator cuff get injured so easily? Why does it take so long to heal? And more importantly, what can we do to prevent this? We’re here to find out. The rotator cuff is actually a set of four muscles that rotate the arm (inward and outward) and move it up and down. While these might seem like simple tasks, we have to understand that the shoulder joint is very delicate. It’s called a “multiaxial ball-and-socket synovial joint,” which basically means it allows for a huge range of mobility and movement; however, all this mobility comes at the expense of stability. You could think of the rotator cuff as the glue that holds your arm in place while it’s performing intricate tasks. Unfortunately, these muscles are sometimes weak, overworked, and/or tight. Immediately after my injury, I consulted my aunt, Dr. Caroline Cruz Ynion, a doctor specializing in rehabilitation medicine to see what could be done. Basically, we had to first get the inflammation down to manageable levels. Inflammation is your body’s natural response to sickness or injuries. It’s a mechanism that allows for healing and recovery. However, too much of it can also be a problem. The latter was true in my case; I found it hard to do normal tasks such as eating, dressing up, and showering. My rotator cuff was so inflamed and tender that it felt debilitating. Once we were able to manage inflammation, we then proceeded to controlled and progressive stretches that gently increased my range of motion. These were rather painful at first, but slowly and surely improved pain levels and mobility. As I increased the number of sets and the frequency of the stretches, I felt significant improvements—significant enough that I was allowed to resume my resistance training program. Of course, I had to take several steps back when it came to my strength training. I was scared to risk re-injuring myself and had to play it really smart. I focused on movements that gave me virtually no pain and dropped weight and intensity altogether. As I started to gain momentum, I gradually increased the resistance and volume such that I’m almost back to my original form. Almost. One of the things I had to take time with were my lateral raises. These felt painful, so I had to focus on proper movement rather than lifting a heavy weight. I also double dosed on my favorite collagen supplement to help facilitate the rebuilding process. All in all, progress was acceptable but still frustrating, especially for a competitive athlete like me. So what else could be done? That’s where I decided to experiment a little bit and tried out Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS). TENS is done using a small compact device with electrodes attached to your skin. I found this to be one of the most convenient and cost-effective modalities available to me during this pandemic. I bit the bullet and chose one that had excellent feedback from other athletes. I just had to attach the electrodes to my back, turn on the device, and deal with the foreign twitching and tingling sensation on my back and arm. Supposedly, by sending electrical signals directly to the injured muscles, blood flow can be improved, pain can be masked, and inflammation can be mitigated. So did it work? Quite surprisingly, yes. To be honest, I was quite skeptical at first, but after reading journals and research papers discussing its efficacy, I decided to give it a shot. I was only expecting marginal progress but after a few sessions, pain subsided from around seven to a manageable five. I also felt a significant improvement in mobility since my inflamed muscles were no longer rubbing against each other as much. A word of caution though: You have to choose the right device. I believe in the “buy nice so you don’t have to buy twice” mentality. So I decided to get a rather expensive one. After all, taking care of your body is an investment in itself. I was able to compare my unit with a cheaper generic one and the results were night and day. Things like current rating, electrode quality/size, and electrical signal patterns made the difference. So what now? My injury is healing, but how do I prevent it from happening again? Unfortunately, triathletes like me are prone to such an injury but there are a few things we can do to prevent this. When we work out, we often target the large muscle groups and the aesthetically pleasing ones. The chest, back, biceps, etc. are all important muscles, but we also need to pay attention to the hardworking role players as well. The rotator cuff is definitely one of them. Grab your resistance bands and do internal and external rotations. Perform lateral raises in a controlled and gradual fashion. Don’t forget to focus on the negative reps to help promote stability and control. Rotator cuff stretches will allow you to improve your range of motion. This, in turn, will lower your risk for strains and injuries. However, we need to make sure that our chest, shoulders, and back also have enough flexibility. If we don’t, imbalances can come into play. An example of this would be slouching due to tight chest muscles. Forward-rotated shoulders put a lot of strain on your rotator cuff and put pressure on the wrong places. Performing strength workouts and cardio (like swimming) should always be done with proper form. Oftentimes, we see ourselves rushing through the movement or wingin’ it. However, once we injure ourselves, all the fitness we’ve built goes down the drain. That’s why it’s important we make sure we aren’t putting ourselves at risk with rushed and improper movements. There’s no escaping it: Rest is an important piece of the puzzle. However, it’s important to note that rest is defined differently for each person. Some people, especially those who’ve built lots of fitness over the years, tend to need less rest to recuperate. Beginners, of course, would need more. This is especially true if you’re doing intense workouts. You can speed up your recovery through different modalities such as massage, TENS, and possibly even supplements like collagen. Just make sure you’re wise when it comes to taking care of your body because it’s the only one you’ve got.  Have some training questions, feedback or suggestions for future articles?

Angelina Jolie’s doc: Eat soy-rich diet to fight breast cancer,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391422/angelina-jolies-doc-eat-soy-rich-diet-to-fight-breast-cancer/,"03:10 PM November 17, 2021","Last October was Breast Cancer Awareness Month, so the Forks Over Knives community hosted a webinar, “Breast Defense: Cancer-Kicking Strategies,” by world-renowned breast cancer surgeon Dr. Kristi Funk. Funk has treated celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Sheryl Crow, and is the best-selling author of “Breasts: The Owners’ Manual.” “One in eight women will get a breast cancer diagnosis in her lifetime. Women who are getting older will be at higher risk,” she said. The good news is that only 5 percent to 10 percent of all breast cancer is genetic; the rest of those diagnosed do not have immediate family with breast cancer. This means we can do something about it. But even with those who do have breast cancer in their family, Funk attributes the dietary and lifestyle patterns of that family to the activation of cancer in the family line. This supports the popular plant-based adage: Genetics loads the gun, environment pulls the trigger. “When you eat animal products, estrogen levels skyrocket, and growth factors like IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor) go through the roof,” she said. “An excess of IGF-1 only exists as a response to consuming animal protein and animal fat.” Funk cited a 2014 study on cell metabolism in over 6,000 adults ages 50-65 who were followed for 18 years. Higher animal protein levels led to a 430-percent increase in cancer deaths and a 7,300-percent increase in diabetes. This is why she promotes “plant warfare,” the consumption of phytonutrients. The curcumin in turmeric, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in green tea, resveratrol in red grapes, omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed and avocados, procyanidins from berries, genistein from soy, lycopene from tomatoes, anthocyanidins from apples, and limonene from oranges all combat cancer. She revealed how, in the first 18 years of her practice, she misguidedly advised her patients to avoid soy. That is until she started doing research for her book and discovered all the studies that debunked a common myth. High levels of estrogen has been linked to increased risk of breast cancer. Soy contains the plant estrogen isoflavone, which some believed to increase breast cancer risk. “It turns out that soy is absolutely antiestrogenic and anticarcinogenic,” Funk admitted. She also disclosed how she started as a typical physician, who never got any nutrition education through medical school, residency, fellowship or practice. “I’d started out researching to prove the way that I had always recommended was correct, which was largely the Mediterranean diet: lean meat—chicken, turkey and fish—with lots of fruits and vegetables. I went into the science and was so utterly blown away … The cellular response to basically all animal protein and all animal fat is nothing but detrimental to your health,” she said. In the 2009 Shanghai Women’s Health Study, which followed over 73,000 women, soy consumption led to a 59-percent decrease in premenopausal breast cancer. American Asian women who had 1.5 servings of soy a week in childhood had a 58-percent drop in adult-onset breast cancer, according to a 1996 study. Even among Korean BRCA gene mutation carriers, there was a 43-percent lower incidence of breast cancer correlated with eating soy in a 2013 study. Meanwhile, in a 2020 study by the International Journal of Epidemiology, when comparing 90th to 10th percentiles of dairy milk consumption, there is a 50-percent increase in breast cancer. Almost 2,000 multiethnic breast cancer survivors on tamoxifen—a drug used to treat breast cancer—followed for over six years experienced a 60-percent lower recurrence. In a 2012 study, just half a cup of soy milk daily among almost 10,000 breast cancer survivors led to a 25-percent drop in recurrence. Funk also shared a 2021 study that concluded isoflavones and soy are not endocrine disruptors. There are no adverse alterations in thyroid function, estrogen levels, ovulation in women and semen levels in men, or negative effects on children. Unsurprisingly, soy tops her list of breast cancer-fighting superfoods, followed by cruciferous vegetables and leafy greens. Flaxseeds came in third. She referred to a 2005 study where participants ate a flaxseed muffin a day, and cancer cell suicide rates increased by over 30 percent, while cancer markers dropped 71 percent and cell division rate decreased by 34 percent. Fiber (from beans, lentils, peas, avocado, berries, barley and broccoli), about 30 grams daily, translates to a 40-percent reduction in breast cancer. Berries, apples, tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic (including onions, leeks, shallots, chives, scallions), turmeric and spices (like black pepper), seaweed and cacao round up her recommendations. To beat breast cancer, Funk advocates, “whole food, plant-based eating that prioritizes vegetables, fruits, 100-percent whole grains and legumes, whole food soy, and ground flaxseed.” “Eliminate all meat, poultry, fish, dairy and eggs. Minimize saturated fat, simple sugars, processed foods and refined cereals. Exercise moderately five hours per week or vigorously 2.5 hours per week. Minimize or eliminate alcohol. And keep your body-mass index below 25,” she added. —CONTRIBUTED Take Dr. Kristi Funk’s four-week challenge at letsbeatbreastcancer.org; pinklotus.com.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Let traditions of love continue,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391382/let-traditions-of-love-continue/,"02:28 PM November 17, 2021","“Peace of mind is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with it.” —Scott Hawkins Suddenly, it’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas! While we like to poke fun at the fact the holidays start in September in the Philippines, we do cherish the time we have to prepare for and anticipate holiday cheer. For those like me who have had a challenging year, the holidays will be my protective bubble, my safe space, albeit temporary! I am making a pact with myself to stay positive and use this time to create new and lasting memories. If you’re looking for a new and improved identity, one that can provide you with the stability you need before moving forward, well, I don’t think such a thing exists. It is the ability to stretch that inner peace and acceptance of reality that you will need to continue life’s journey. Even if this confusing time is completely dreadful, we all know life is perpetually evolving, and everything can change. It’s up to us to make a positive change or not! We are all on this journey. Many things may have changed in my life, but the love I have for life, my family and my dearest friends has not changed. My appreciation for all that is good in my life is permanently heightened. We are still living in restricted times, but there is still a silver lining. We are encouraged by smaller intimate gatherings where we can spend quality time with those we care about. Knowing that time is limited and opportunities are few, we make the most of the time we have for meaningful interactions that can hold us warmly until we see other again, which may not be soon enough. The Thanksgiving holiday is on Nov. 25, and that will be the official start of my holidays. I come into the best season of the year with a renewed appreciation of family, friends and all the blessings, especially just being alive! I am thankful for the gift of health and well-being. This year, more than at any time in my life, I did and continue to do a lot of self-work—emotionally, mentally, spiritually. I have been blessed with opportunities to learn from and be counseled by the best wellness gurus who have held my hand throughout my healing process. As they say, “When the student is ready, the teachers will come.” This is so true! I thank them all with deep gratitude. With the absence of so many events and parties and external factors, I have refocused on my family. They stand by me every single day, showering me with loyalty, love and affection. I am fully supported with love. There is also tough love, especially from my favorite brother-in-law, and while our conversations can sometimes be stressful, I know, without a doubt, that his heart and love for me are pure. My children are my rocks. My personal crisis certainly did not go to waste, seeing how it has strengthened and affirmed the bond I have with my children. Yes, I am their mom, but this year they also mothered me when I needed it the most. Just as I have every year, I will make sure the true meaning of Christmas continues in our hearts and in our home. Our traditions of love continue—so let the shopping begin!

#UsapangCancerTreatment highlights multi-stakeholder perspectives on putting cancer care on the national agenda,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/391295/usapangcancertreatment-highlights-multi-stakeholder-perspectives-on-putting-cancer-care-on-the-national-agenda/,"02:14 PM November 15, 2021","People in some families have what is known as a hereditary cancer syndrome, a cancer risk that runs in the family.This is the case for Jose Albert, who was diagnosed with stage 2 colon cancer 23 years ago. He shared how access to treatment enabled him to surpass his colon cancer ordeal and live with the disease. Jose considers himself as one of the fortunate ones able to navigate and manage the burden of cancer, but at the same time, he is using his voice to champion better access for all cancer patients to receive diagnosis, timely and appropriate treatment, funding, and a better chance of beating cancer. “Once you have cancer, it can be resource-draining. Unfortunately, not all cancer patients, especially the poor and those from the lower income bracket get the proper information on treatment options and get the proper services they need.” In more than a year, COVID-19 has taken over news headlines and the local health agenda. With the spotlight on COVID, non-communicable diseases like cancer have been deprioritized. However, it is important to note that cancer is the third leading cause of death in the Philippines. 189 of every 100,000 Filipinos are afflicted with cancer, while four Filipinos die of cancer every hour or 96 patients every day.  Access to cancer treatment also continues to be a problem during the pandemic. Therefore, with or without a pandemic, there is a necessity to include cancer care in the national agenda. The good news is that the passage of the National Integrated Cancer Control Act (NICCA) guarantees that all cancer patients and cancer survivors regardless of cancer stage, age, ethnicity, gender, religion may have a chance to live more hopeful tomorrows. “We predict that in 10 years, cancer may be our number one killer,” said Dr. Samuel Ang, Vice-Chairman of the National Integrated Cancer Control (NICC) Council. “[But] because of the NICCA law, there is a ray of hope in the Philippines. NICCA provides the means for funding.”   It is in this light that the Department of Health, the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP), MSD in the Philippines’ Hope From Within, and AstraZeneca’s AZ Cares gathered national leaders, health experts, and patients to discuss the national agenda on healthcare and cancer treatment access in #UsapangCancerTreatment — the third episode of the ‘Tita Hope Talks’ cancer conversation series. Making healthcare a national priority In her message, Vice President Leni Robredo said, “With the passage of the Universal Healthcare Act, it is our job to ensure that we effectively carry out this health reforms, to enact policies that will push the universal healthcare agenda forward such as empowering our barangay health workers, strengthening health care regulations and creating safeguards so that healthcare systems in local governments are successfully integrated with their provincial counterparts and to ensure that the system is fully funded by strengthening the collaboration between the private and public sector.” Discussing the effect of the pandemic to cancer patients, Senator Panfilo Lacson shared, “The limitations brought about by this health crisis have also led to reduced diagnosis and treatment of other serious illnesses, including cancer. Cancer is indiscriminate. It sees no bound, age, social class or gender. Science tells us that early detection can prevent many critical illnesses. I prioritize our programs to make medical intervention affordable, available and accessible.” Meanwhile, Quezon City Representative Alfred Vargas recalled efforts done to fund the country’s cancer program. “We successfully included Php 620 million as cancer assistance fund into an overall Php 756 million for the cancer supportive care and palliative care access program in the 2021 national budget. This year, Php 786 million has been allocated in the national expenditure program which will lay the foundations for the 2022 national budget,” Vargas highlighted. Former Senator JV Ejercito, who became instrumental in the passage of the law, urged fellow legislators to ensure the continuous implementation of the landmark cancer care law. “I hope that legislators will really fund the cancer control act because cancer is very expensive to treat. A lot of Filipinos are suffering right now. Especially in this time of pandemic, all the more that the NICCA needs to be funded so that people who have cancer will have a new lease in life,” noted Ejercito. “We have to continue the fight. Continue making noise so that this landmark law will be funded and its implementation becomes a reality.”  What’s next for NICCA? Key provisions under NICCA include the creation of the Philippine Cancer Center to promote and encourage cancer research, provide training to medical professionals, and house the population-based cancer registry. It also mandated the creation of a Cancer Assistance Fund and the National Integrated Cancer Control Council. NICCA also states that PhilHealth will expand its benefit packages to include primary care screening, detection, diagnosis, treatment assistance, supportive care, survivorship follow-up care, rehabilitation, and end-of-life care for all types and stages of cancer in both adults and children. “I envision the NICCA to provide the framework for future cancer centers in both public and private sectors. An area within the Lung Center of the Philippines has been identified as the site for the Philippine Cancer Center, it will be the apex hospital for all government cancer centers where the most difficult cases will be referred”.  Dr. Samuel Ang also said that “One step that NICCA will ensure is the creation of a cancer registry for the whole country to know the real situation of cancer in the Philippines.” “DOH has designated cancer specialty hospitals around the country. We have also started refurbishing these hospitals so that patients in the provinces will have access to services. We also have support for diagnostics through the cancer assistance fund. There is a budget for cancer medicines, supportive and palliative medicine access program,” shared Dr. Mae Dolendo, member of the NICC Council. The role of innovation in cancer treatment A comprehensive cancer care law provides more innovative treatment options for patients. “In the fight against cancer, the value of innovation has never been more emphasized. We have entered an era of new medicines where we are pushing science to have a meaningful impact on patients,” highlighted Dr. Teodoro Padilla, Executive Director of PHAP. “Cancer treatment is a complex approach. Different cancers require different treatment approaches and with different outcomes,” noted Mr. Pieter de Richter, Chief Strategy Officer of Ipsos Healthcare. “If these innovative treatments reach more patients, studies show that patients can enjoy significant life years, progression-free life years. This means that even if a patient is undergoing treatment, one can continue to perform daily activities, enjoy life with less pain and adverse effects. These innovative treatments can make all the difference to a cancer patient,” said Dr. Madeleine Valera, former Health Undersecretary. #UsapangAccessSaCancerTreatment is the third part of the Hope From Within’s Tita Hope Talks, a series of multi-stakeholder dialogues focused on improving access to quality cancer care for the Filipino patient, especially in the time of pandemic. This special session on access to treatment is co-presented by the Department of Health, the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP), AstraZeneca (AZ Cares) and MSD’s Hope From Within, in collaboration with PSMO, PCS-Can Com and Hi-Precision.

How to create a diet that uniquely works for you,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/390882/how-to-create-a-diet-that-uniquely-works-for-you/,"12:48 PM November 08, 2021","Do you need to follow some rules and be strict with your diet to manage your weight? Some of these rules may include skipping breakfast and eating only once or twice a day, eliminating food nutrients like carbs, or lessening your intake to 1,200 calories. Through the years, I have also tried several diets, not really for weight loss, but for me to observe the effects on my body, moods, and energy level to share the experience with others. I’ve tried vegan eating for one year right after watching the documentary film What the Health, on Netflix which made me feel good at the start but didn’t feel like a balanced diet anymore after a year. I also tried intermittent fasting, but it only lasted a day. I tried a low-carb diet, but I couldn’t function well with my work and activities physically and mentally. Based on my personal experience, research, and experiences with my clients, I’ve come up with numerous learnings: Now ask yourself if your eating plan is unique to your lifestyle, goals, health, body type, and food satisfaction. Avoid hormonal imbalance by focusing on balancing your lifestyle first (sleep and exercise) before thinking of ways to lose weight drastically. That’s why it is important to consult a health professional regarding what and how much macronutrients (carbohydrates, fat, and protein) your body needs to match your daily physical activities. You need to eat less if you move less and eat more if you move more but eat right, so you don’t gain weight. Your unique eating plan should always consider the best meal timing plus the right type and amount of food quality based on your exercise and sleep schedule. If you do more cardio exercises like hiking or running during the day, increase your intake of the right type of carbs (whole grains like brown rice, oatmeal, or multi-grain bread) to maximize your performance. If you want to build more muscles and you usually lift heavier weights, then eat the appropriate amount of healthy protein like mean meat, seafood, egg, chicken, nuts, and seeds. I’ve dealt with people who struggled to lose the last 10 pounds for years because of skipping breakfast. When they started to eat on time based on their activities, they were able to lose the last few pounds in a span of two to three months and still sustain the lifestyle until now. If a fasting diet (skipping a meal, not eating for 12-16 hours straight, or restricting calories on some days of the week) is not compatible with your work and exercise schedule, then maybe it won’t work for you. Keep in mind that you can still regain the weight you’ve lost if your eating plan is not sustainable. It is a common practice of health professionals to tell the patients what to eat and avoid to improve their health condition. Patients will keep the do’s and don’ts of healthy eating, but in reality, it is hard to follow something drastic like eating vegetables and low-fat meals after years of eating meat and deep-fried food. The most important thing to do right now is to know why eating healthy is beneficial for one’s unique health type. Consider going on a diet to improve your health issues, strengthen your immune system, improve metabolism/balance hormones. When you focus on the process, one step at a time, you create habits and eventually embrace a sustainable lifestyle that can significantly affect one’s health profile, like improved cholesterol and sugar levels aside from weight loss. Your unique eating plan considers your current health condition, genetics, and body type. If you are predisposed to diabetes, as early as now, you should find ways to avoid soft drinks, cakes, and cookies and find healthier food alternatives for your cravings. If you have blood pressure issues or are susceptible to heart problems, focus on getting high-fiber food and avoid high sodium and high-fat food like deep-fried meals, pork fat, and chicken skin. If you are an endomorph (with a large body frame and more body fat), you can avoid excessive high-calorie carbohydrate foods like sweets and pastries. Eat a moderate amount of healthy carbs high in fiber like vegetables and whole grains. Have you ever experienced eating bland diet food and then had a difficult time sleeping because you were not satisfied at all and then you wanted to eat something that you like? How do you like your eggs in the morning? How can you make your lunch and dinner more satisfying? Create a healthy eating plan that won’t make you hungry when afternoon strikes until nighttime. It should be a plan that you can always look forward to because of the taste, color, variety. Enjoying the overall eating experience should be unique to your culture, personality, and family tradition.  You can always vary your way of healthy cooking by steaming, roasting, boiling, or sautéing. You can add more flavor to your food with herbs and spices and by including more color in your dishes with vegetables like bell pepper, carrot, string beans, and cabbage. It is okay to try some of your favorite treat food every once in a while, like desserts, takeout food, and drinks, to avoid the feeling of food deprivation. However, always try to apply weight management strategies like portion control, environmental control, social assertiveness, and resetting your mind to prevent health and weight issues.

Is it better to homeschool minors than vaccinate them?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/390804/is-it-better-to-homeschool-minors-than-vaccinate-them/,"06:41 PM November 05, 2021","(Conclusion) In March, even before global scientists sounded the alarm on mass vaccination, we proposed to suspend the vaccination in 40-year-olds and younger, and in all healthy young adults, after looking at the available risk-benefit data. There is no good data up to now really showing that the benefit outweighs the risk in this relatively low-risk population. At most, we can say it’s an equipoise, neither for or against vaccination. What is boosting the meager data is the collective opinion of international health agencies and some expert societies endorsing the vaccination even in young adults with apparently robust immune systems. All the more so in teenagers 18 years and younger, wherein the risk of dying from COVID-19 is exceedingly rare, compared to the risk of developing heart swelling (myocarditis) and heart failure, which may have long-term consequences and could cut short their lives. As late as four months ago, a doctor would have been immediately labeled as incompetent and out of his/her mind if he/she recommended vaccination in minors. Now it’s recommended, and might even be made mandatory as a requisite for resumption of in-person classroom instruction. The same mandate and rationale will likely be made for small kids in the near future. Yale University professor Dr. Harvey Risch, one of the most respected American epidemiologists, advises parents to pull their healthy children out of public schools and just homeschool them rather than allow them to be vaccinated. That may be an option parents here will have to consider if their adolescent and teenage children are required to be vaccinated first before they get enrolled. The strange thing about this conundrum is that many parents seem to be convinced that they should have their minor children vaccinated at all costs. An acquaintance even brought their minor children to the United States just to have them vaccinated. One of them developed a constantly fast heartbeat upon return here, and had to be placed on medication. In previous commentaries, we’ve suggested to the Department of Health (DOH) to explain to the public, not in general or relative terms, but in real and absolute terms what the benefits and risks of vaccination are for each age category, especially for minors. The DOH sometimes overwhelms the public with impressive-sounding but unnecessary information that may not really be useful. We reiterate that expressing data on effectiveness and safety in terms of relative risk reduction (RRR) can be misleading. We’re sure the DOH or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have no intention to mislead us, but they seem to be fascinated with RRR figures, and have unwittingly misled themselves and the public. We’ve given this example before but it’s worth repeating for better clarity. If the risk to suffer from a COVID-19 complication is 10 in 100 million cases or a 0.00001-percent risk, and you reduce that with vaccination to one in 100 million, that would be a 90-percent RRR, and that sounds very impressive indeed. But if you express the real absolute risk reduction (ARR), it’s only a 0.000009-percent reduction of the risk or actual benefit to be expected. It’s good to consider both the ARR and the RRR but, as far as we know, most policymakers look more at the ARR to decide when evaluating various treatments and interventions for public health problems such as COVID-19. In the example given, a 90-percent RRR in the risk of a minor to die from COVID-19 complications sounds very impressive, which to some is like saving nine minors out of 10. This is grossly incorrect! Our health officials should inform the public what the actual or real risk is for a minor to die from COVID-19. If the risk is infinitesimally small like one in 300,000, as some calculate the risk to be, that will help the parents balance the equation and decide for their children. Is vaccinating 300,000 minors to save one worth all the potential risks of the vaccination being considered? Compare this small benefit with the risk of harm. The number needed to vaccinate is 300,000 to save one life. What is the number needed to vaccinate to seriously harm a minor? Scanning the literatures, varying figures are given for this, but a fair estimate is something like one in 25,000. It’s true though that majority of vaccine-related myocarditis and/or pericarditis cases (swelling of the sac covering of the heart) are not serious. But, if we go by the general life course of individuals afflicted with myocarditis, a third develop a progressively worsening course. That suggests that the number to seriously harm is about one in 75,000. The data are really insufficient to make definitive conclusions. But as it looks now, the risk of harm appears to outweigh the benefit in minors. The prudent thing to do is wait until we get clearer data on the long-term complications. Our health officials and the public must snap out of their trance and start asking relevant questions until they’re fully convinced they’re doing the right thing for their minor children. We urge the media and the public to keep on asking the ARR from our health officials, and stop being mesmerized with RRRs. We have pointed out previously that we only talk about RRRs in theoretical, scientific dissertations and discussions, but not for policy decisions involving serious public health concerns such as this pandemic. The RRR stats are like the Hollywood building props. They look real from afar but if you come closer and scrutinize, they’re just facades with no solid backing. Propping the false facades with lame generic explanations that the benefit outweighs the risk may create an illusion of rationality, but the whole thing will fall on some people’s faces in due time. We urge our DOH and FDA to invest in simple but reliable analysis of local data so we don’t have to rely on hand-me-down data from other countries. A few months ago, the Australian drug regulators revised their recommendation for the AstraZeneca vaccine, and advised against the use of the vaccine in those less than 60 years of age. Based on their data analysis, the risk of potentially serious or fatal blood clot complications with the vaccine is one in 71,430 in those aged 60 and older; one in 37,000 in the 50-59 age group; and one in 32,250 in the younger than 50 age group. Their analysis indicates that the younger the age of the vaccinees, the higher the risk of potentially serious reactions, mainly blood clot complications that may lead to death. They’re better off taking their chances with COVID-19 than their risk of dying from the vaccination. These are simple but very useful data culled from analytics. Our problem here is that we need to accurately collect our data first, so we can be confident that any conclusion or even just impression derived from them, would not be erroneous. We don’t have to belabor the real-world problem here that the published data and actual field observations don’t match, and the system of adverse reaction reporting for vaccines is faulty and not truly reflective of actual incidence of serious side effects. Most physicians we’ve talked to say that the vaccine-related adverse effects are grossly underreported, and many cases have been quickly dismissed as not vaccine-related, despite the temporal relationship of vaccine administration and occurrence of serious side effects. In summary, we appeal to the FDA, our health officials and expert advisers to rethink the decision to vaccinate minors. If even experts from the Centers for Disease Control amd Prevention in the United States admit that they’re still in the learning curve on the potentially serious side effects of the vaccine in young people, why should we join the popular bandwagon of mass vaccination and risk unknown perils for our children? Whatever happened to the primary maxim of “First, do no harm (Primum non nocere)” in the dispensation of medicines and treatments? Why is an inhibitory “abundance of caution” exercised for some tried-and-tested medicines like ivermectin, but conveniently trivialized for an experimental vaccine that has a pile of unresolved issues and concerns? What is happening to our country, and the world?  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

OPINION: Enough of queer love. Give me queer sex ,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/390506/opinion-enough-of-queer-love-give-me-queer-sex/,"06:20 PM October 31, 2021","Before anything else, trust me: I’m a fan of tender, twee gay love stories. Full disclosure: I was rooting for Cardcaptor Sakura’s not-so-secret token teen gay couple Yukito and Touya (we used to wait for Touya to furtively stare at Yukito, electrified every time we’d catch it), and I thought Love Simon was vomit-butterflies-and-rainbows sweet. The Half of It gave me flashbacks of the awkwardness and uncertainty of young love. Give me all the cuddly, saccharine delights of a nicely-written romantic show with two queer people: I’m here for it. But after watching the latest season of “Sex Education” though, I am convinced: we should definitely have more queer sex too. Pure, raw, queer sex. I demand that mainstream media give us more moments like the flamboyant Eric Effiong negotiating sexual positions with his boyfriend Adam Groff (spoiler alert: Adam apparently is a bottom, which he confesses to Eric to clear the confusion. Eric thought that the reason Adam doesn’t want to do penetrative sex was that he still was ambivalent and ashamed about being gay.) Or maybe something like the series’ other gay student Anwar confiding his anxiety of dying from AIDS to a sexual health counselor, who promptly educates him that PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) medication now exists to help prevent HIV infection, and that antiretrovirals these days actually guarantee a long life for PLHIVs. I wish for more scenes like that of young lesbians Lily and Ola role-playing in bed, exploring each other’s fantasies, not to satisfy the male gaze, but to revel in all its messy, fun, female glory. I think sex doesn’t necessarily have to be a destination one reaches within the relationship, but a journey pursued for the sheer pleasure of traveling. Over dinner here in London a few months ago, my friend Ana shared to me and my partner how surprised she was when a local asked her out on a date with no strings attached: “When they said they wanted to have coffee, they meant that—they really just wanted to have coffee.” My partner mused, “That’s because people here have no hang-ups when it comes to sex. They could easily get it, so there’s no point lying about their intentions. A coffee date is a coffee date. Hookups are hookups.” I’m not sure how true my partner’s observation is, since I haven’t really experienced dating here. (Not complaining.) But it made me think of how dating, as a young gay man in the Philippines, was awkward and riddled with shame. Everyone on Grindr is faceless and discreet, and there’s a general discomfort talking about sex beyond alter Twitter and other queer online spaces (even discussing your sexual history with the STD counselor or doctor can make people squirm.) But tales of queer romance? LGBT+ Filipinos are in love with that. BL series have become immensely popular during this pandemic: the popularity of Gameboys, Gaya sa Pelikula, and Hello Stranger reveal that there’s a hunger for queer love stories. Which is quite understandable: we deserve our love lives depicted in the most normal way possible, without the need to push a monumental gay agenda (although let’s face it, even without ramming the message, queer stories in the media may make non-LGBT+ people likelier to accept the idea LGBT+ rights.) The light-heartedness of BL is a welcome change from fictional depictions of queer relationships often set within a milieu of fear and discrimination. Showing us as either self-destructive, repressed, or depressed (think Brokeback Mountain, Call Me By Your Name, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Baka Bukas, Mamu; And a Mother Too) can romanticize tragedies too much, convincing us that it’s not real love unless it’s doomed. What if we try focusing on how normal queer sex is, instead? Maybe that will allow us to have more honest, less cringy conversations around our bodies and our desires. We would no longer be like children in the playground giggling for saying “titi” or “pekpek”, as if uttering body parts out loud would deduct salvation brownie points. When I was younger, my mother found out I was dating a boy, and she scolded me: “Anong gagawin nyo, mage-espadahan?” Up to now people still use that as a joke to shame gay people, as if it was something unnatural. Cis-het people are so absurd for policing queer sex, which frankly says a lot about their own sex lives. It took me a lot of unlearning to accept that there’s nothing wrong with queer sex. My pleasure is not unnatural, and no one has the right to shame me. As historian and professor Yuval Noah Harari argues: “Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behavior, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition. No culture has ever bothered to forbid men to photosynthesize, women to run faster than the speed of light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other. Mouths, for example, appeared because the earliest multicellular organisms needed a way to take nutrients into their bodies. We still use mouths for that purpose, but we also use them to kiss, speak, and we if are Rambo, to pull the pins out of hand grenades. Are any of these uses unnatural simply because our worm-like ancestors 600 million years ago didn’t do those things with their mouths?” So yes, show me queer sex. Tell me stories of mutually-consenting queer people doing things with their bodies. I want it within and outside the confines of relationships, pursued for the sake of pleasure. I hope every queer and non-queer person can see that there’s no shame in enjoying our bodies safely and consensually.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"A Miss Philippines is openly gay—so, what now?",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/390410/a-miss-philippines-is-openly-gay-so-what-now/,"03:58 PM October 31, 2021","Beatrice Luigi Gomez stunned the country when she candidly admitted being gay. She has since been crowned Miss Universe Philippines 2021. So, what now? While Gomez’s nonchalant admission is huge, especially for the LGBTQIA+ community, breaking stereotypes that gay women must be manly or butch, the Philippines still has a long way to go in initiating inclusivity in the workplace. “We’re not talking about laws or even civil union that’s probably a decade away from us today,” said Chris Eugenio, Philippine Financial and Inter-Industry Pride (PFIP) board trustee. “We’re not in the business of creating laws. We’re talking about basic rights. We are about providing equal benefits so that the LGBTQIA+ workforce will feel they are truly valued equally in the company.” PFIP, a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization, just released an unprecedented survey to back up claims of discrimination in the workspace. It is the first-ever LGBTQIA+ work inclusion survey conducted in the country. The 2021 LGBTQIA+ survey covered six key facets of inclusivity in companies: Inclusive policies, inclusive benefits, organizational support, technology for inclusion, education and enablement, and social responsibility and thought leadership. The survey was conducted in more than 100 companies across the Philippines from various industries. The extensive survey showed that the Philippines has organizations that support inclusivity—the big conglomerates and multinational companies. These companies usually contextualize in the local setting mandates that are already imposed in corporate headquarters abroad. Majority have antidiscrimination policies in place. These are organizations, Eugenio said, that walk the talk by publicly supporting LGBTQIA+ workers. The survey showed that 88 percent have procedures that raise concerns regarding discrimination, 87 percent practice antidiscrimination policies and 86 percent have antidiscrimination policies for sexual orientation, and gender identity and expression. Eugenio said there are three common kinds of discrimination in the workplace: the right to a preferred name and pronouns, the right to dress according to one’s gender expression, and the right to inclusive amenities, including the much-contested gender-neutral restrooms. Without policies in place, the workplace quickly becomes an environment for microaggressions. It will incite innocuous comments, like “trans ka kaya mukha kang babae,” or “baka hindi ka lang naka-date ng lalaki.” Reacting to these microaggressions, one risks being called corny, sensitive or a snowflake. “This happens all the time. That’s why we need antidiscrimination policies. The right to a preferred name and pronouns is basic respect when it comes to someone’s sexual orientation and gender identity,” he said. The workplace has a binary code of conduct—he and she, male and female, must wear work clothes based on the company’s dress code. The women’s movement says, “Don’t tell me how to dress,” but some companies still dictate that their female salespersons, for example, wear stockings and heels. “Gender is nonbinary. How LGBTQIA+ express themselves is extremely important. What if ayoko magpalda? If you force people to wear clothes not aligned with their gender expression, they will be subjected to discrimination,” Eugenio said. He noted it is common for coworkers to lift the skirts of lesbians at work and say, “O, babae ka pala.” More than half of the companies surveyed allow employees to declare their chosen name and pronouns in systems like email and company directories: 71 percent provide the option to declare a chosen name, and 64 percent can declare pronouns. “This is great practice so you don’t get misgendered. Someone named Ronaldo may not want to be called Naldo and would prefer Rona,” he said. “Just asking someone a preferred name or pronoun is basic decency. Don’t assume. They would feel valued that the organizations want to get to know them more.” In this absence, some recruiters are known to literally ask applicants, “Bakla ka ba?” PFIP works with the private sector to work with the existing practices, to test the limits of restrictions and parameters. There was a time when the insurance commission prohibited insuring same-sex partners. Last year, after years of talks, the insurance commission issued a clarificatory circular to end all speculation, he said. Same-sex partners can now be insured. “Private companies jumped in on that. I can now assign my partner kasama sa insurance, medical coverage because he is considered my beneficiary,” Eugenio said. Large companies are using their influence to change the rules and internal policies. A leading health maintenance organization refused to insure same-sex partners, but multinationals like IBM and Accenture threatened to pull their accounts, according to Eugenio. “That’s why we did this survey. We want smaller organizations to know that’s it’s OK pala, that this is easy and not cumbersome,” he said. “You can attract and retain better talents this way. A lot of research correlates inclusion with innovation.” The survey also showed that more than half of the companies offer inclusive benefits to same-sex domestic partners, and there is room for growth in transgender-inclusive practices: 75 percent have equal medical benefits, 55 percent considered partners as family members for other benefits, and 50 percent have equal benefits for life insurance. “I should be able to avail of family benefits. If I want to adopt, I should take paternal leave. My partner is my family,” he said. “We are not a lobby group, so don’t expect us to go out in the streets with placards. What we can do is gather data and provide a public platform for discussion starting with the result of the survey.” Eugenio said that national television networks, the biggest employer of LGBTQIA+ members, and other stereotypical LGBTQIA+ industries don’t have these policies in place. Not all companies can afford to hire people to look into these issues, so he hopes the survey will serve as a yardstick. PFIP released the survey months away from Pride Month to make a statement that commitment to the LGBTQIA+ community is year-round. “We’re busting the door wide open. If we have a law, this should not be a conversation,” Eugenio said. “We have to rely on the private sector to set the best practices. This is one step closer to something more specific. If we wait for laws to be passed, walang mangyayari.” —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

Can molnupiravir cause cancer and birth defects?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/390100/can-molnupiravir-cause-cancer-and-birth-defects/,"07:47 PM October 22, 2021","It works by disrupting the genetic component of the virus. If it alters the viral RNA, can it not also alter or disrupt the body’s own DNA? (Conclusion) In last week’s column, we discussed that ivermectin and molnupiravir may both be considered valuable additions to our early-treatment regimen for COVID-19. Despite the expected pricey cost of molnupiravir, we still consider it as cost-effective, in relation to the stiffer direct and indirect costs of lockdowns and healthcare exhaustion on the national health and economy. Of course, the much cheaper ivermectin is likely to be, hands down, more cost-effective. There are some basic differences, though, between the two. Ivermectin appears to be more versatile, and is able to work against the virus on several sites, while molnupiravir works in a more specific, limited site in scrambling the viral genetic composition to prevent its multiplication. Because of its versatility, ivermectin may be used both for prevention and treatment of early as well as advanced cases, while molnupiravir is currently only supported by data evaluating it in early treatment of elderly and other potentially high-risk cases with comorbidities. So far, the bits of information we’re getting about molnupiravir are coming from company-issued press releases and interviews with company executives. It cannot be overemphasized that we need to wait for a more stringent expert review of the detailed results of the clinical trial. One concern which we hope could be cleared by our experts is the potential cancer and birth-defect-producing effects of molnupiravir. Molnupiravir works by disrupting and scrambling the RNA or the genetic component of the virus, hence preventing its multiplication. It mimics two important components of the viral RNA, substituting for these essential components, and sabotaging the replication process of the virus. In effect, molnupiravir converts the virus into impotent mutants or variants. It’s like giving the virus a dose of its own medicine, instead of allowing it to mutate into more infectious and virulent variants. This is indeed an excellent mechanism of action for molnupiravir. But the question many experts have in mind is that: “If it alters the viral RNA, can it not also alter or disrupt the body’s own DNA?” It’s textbook knowledge that when you alter the body’s DNA, you’re flirting with danger because you can potentially promote the development of cancer cells. Early studies in experimental animal cell cultures showed this apparent “red flag.” Professor Ron Swanstrom of the University of North Carolina asked in a published commentary “whether molnupiravir could be metabolized into a precursor of DNA,” that can enter the human host cell nucleus, leading to potential cancer cell formation? TrialSite, a resource on ongoing clinical studies, reported that the clinical development of a similar molecule to molnupiravir was also abandoned in 2003 when the scientists noted the cancerogenic potential of the molecule. Cancer-producing drugs or so-called mutagenic drugs can also be the cause of congenital defects or cancer in babies whose parents may have taken these mutagenic drugs when the fetus was conceived or as it developed in the uterus. The investigators of the Merck study may have been well aware of this potential effect, hence in the inclusion criteria for the clinical trial of molnupiravir, they “required” males not to donate sperm or engage in sex without contraception. The female patients enrolled in the trial were required to not become pregnant or to breastfeed for some time until the observation period for the study was completed, which was 28 days from the first dose of molnupiravir. Merck brushed off this concern simply with a statement that there is “no evidence of the potential for mutagenicity” for molnupiravir, and that the company is “very comfortable that the drug will be safe if used as intended.” Based on the limited results included in the press release, there was no indication that molnupiravir had more undesirable side effects than placebo. In fact, there was a higher discontinuation rate for placebo due to side effects considered by the patients to be drug-related. So, short-term safety and efficacy of molnupiravir look very good. We don’t know yet though what the long-term picture might be, if the cancerogenic potential seen in animal cultures could be significant to cause cancers in those who take it after several years, or if it could cause birth defects or cancers in babies of parents who have taken the drug shortly before or after conception, and during pregnancy. Merck claims it has conducted extensive tests on molnupiravir in experimental animals and is convinced the concerns on cancer and birth defects are not an issue. However, prominent scientists who have worked on this class of drugs like professor Raymond Schinazi of the Emory University School of Medicine in the United States, are not convinced. “Proceed with caution and at your own peril,” warned Schinazi, in a published commentary. He was one of the scientists who was working on a similar compound in 2003, and chose to abandon it when the cancer-inducing potential became apparent. Taking all these positive and negative factors for molnupiravir, we believe that it can still be considered a promising drug included in the early treatment of COVID-19, provided its administration be strictly limited to the elderly, and those with clinical features of a high-risk outcome—the obese, diabetic, hypertensive, with heart disease and other risk-producing comorbid conditions. The risk of dying from COVID-19 in the next week or two in these cases is much higher than the risk of dying from cancer five to 10 years down the road. We figure that with a short-term administration (five days), the potential cancerogenic effect may not be that significant, vis-à-vis the risk of dying in patients with a high-risk profile. We do not recommend it for long-term prophylactic treatment, which can have a cumulative effect, increasing the risk of cancer development. Until the concern on cancer and birth defects is adequately resolved, molnupiravir should not be given to females within the reproductive age, and to males, at any age, who have partners within the reproductive age. If, for whatever reason, it was given to these individuals, they should be forewarned about the potential for birth defects in their offspring should the female gets pregnant in the near future. The data is not very clear on this yet, and it’s best to have an abundance of caution in this regard. We suggest that the FDA requires a boxed warning on the package and the drug literature on this potential for cancer and birth defects. In patients who are already hospitalized with severe or critical disease or those beyond the fifth day of symptoms, molnupiravir should not be given also because it was shown to be ineffective in these cases. Several countries like the US, Australia and Singapore have already made advance reservations for molnupiravir. Our government may also wish to set aside part of its budget to order the drug at the promised discounted rates, rather than allocating everything for vaccines. And if most national governments could give molnupiravir such a welcoming accommodation despite its unproven long-term safety, we see no reason anymore why they should maintain a hard line against the good old, safe, effective and cheap ivermectin. If they still do, something is definitely wrong somewhere.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
How to talk with tweens and teens,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/389853/how-to-talk-with-tweens-and-teens/,"03:40 PM October 17, 2021","My easygoing 10-year-old now suddenly snaps when corrected, while my 6-year-old is starting to act like her tweener kuya, too. With quarantine measures dragging on, we may be spending more time at home but not necessarily happily together. Lines blur as workspace and the pressure it brings invades our homes. In a webinar for the Brotherhood of Christian Businessmen and Professionals Alabang East chapter, developmental psychologist Dr. Angie Sievert-Fernandez showed a clip of a TV ad where a young boy was being scolded at dinnertime. It ended with: “A national study showed that three out of four Filipino teenagers would rather not have meals with their families. Gawing masaya ang hapag-usapan (Make mealtimes happy).” “We may be connected but there’s no connection—the energy that exists between two people when they feel seen, heard and valued, when they can give and receive without judgment, and when they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship [is not there],” said Sievert-Fernandez. She shared what we can expect from our children as they enter their tween years: Fernandez said we must understand our children’s stage in an environment of unpredictable events, health and well-being, technology and media, amid the pandemic impact of isolation, frustration, anger, uncertainty, grief, anxiety, trauma and boredom. Given all this, how can we connect with them? “Turn down the shark music,” she advised, referring to the ominous “Jaws” soundtrack. When voices are up, senses shut down. It makes us jump to conclusions, which gets in the way of connection. Then, chase the “why.” For instance, when your child shuts herself in her room or answers monosyllabically, is she hungry, angry, lonely, tired or sleepy? How you talk to them matters, too. A common thing she hears from patients is: “When I tell my parents I’m sad, I’m told I should be grateful,” or variations of how parents were “during their time.” “This doesn’t work. You lived in a different world from now. That doesn’t help,” explained Sievert-Fernandez. However, she said that values are not time-bound so that doesn’t change. Tweens need to foster positive feelings about themselves, others and their environment. They need to explore and test their own ideas, skills and talents, and be shown how to use their potential positively. They must have their feelings and concerns recognized and respected. “Ask specifics, like, ‘What was the best part of your day, or the most difficult?’ instead of general questions. Encourage them to talk about their emotions and the possible reasons for these. Help them learn conflict management by modeling it for them,” said Sievert-Fernandez, who shared that one of her children once said to her, “That’s why I like talking to you, because you don’t talk.” Listening is very important. Teens must have strong, positive role models. They need their opinions and ideas to be recognized and respected, too. Let them learn from their mistakes and fix self-destructive behaviors. They need to be educated and led into adulthood. How? “Listen, listen, listen. Allow for guided decisions, and recognize their independence and individuality. Engage them in conversation, not a lecture, or they won’t listen,” she warned. When there is resentment, there is no connection. Sievert-Fernandez shared more tips for positive communication: Stick to “I” messages. Instead of “You’re so lazy,” say: “It makes me feel so frustrated/upset seeing your messy room, please clean up.” This way, you don’t attack their character. It makes them less resentful and they will be less likely to tune you out. Avoid dismissing their concern, belittling, name-calling, blaming without clarifying the cause, giving a moral lecture or threatening, as this shuts down the thinking part of their brain. She quoted Renee Jain: “The way we speak to our child matters, for those words travel beyond their ears, settling into the creases of their hearts and the crevices of their self-worth.” Sievert-Fernandez added, “The most effective parenting strategy is to focus on the relationship. As children grow and develop, the way we communicate with them needs to evolve, too.” —CONTRIBUTED Teletherapy sessions, tel. 0917-5557469; [email protected]  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Greco Belgica’s brush with death,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388788/greco-belgicas-brush-with-death/,"11:56 PM September 24, 2021","Physically fit at 43, the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission chair thought licking COVID would be a walk in the park. He was wrong When Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) chair Greco Belgica had fever and body malaise four weeks ago, he hoped it was just an ordinary flu or, if it were COVID, that his healthy body could easily lick the virus. After all, at 43, he was in tip-top shape and physically fit. He was a health and fitness buff, an athletic swimmer and a taekwondo martial artist. He exercises four to five times a week. He basks under the sun every morning for more than 30 minutes, jogs on the treadmill for another 30 minutes, and lifts weights. He eats brown rice and vegetables most of the time and avoids sweets, junk food and drinks. He doesn’t smoke nor drink alcohol. He loves eating fruits in the morning and takes his supplements every day. Licking COVID should be a walk in the park, or so he thought. His mother, Dr. Carmelita “Meth” Belgica, gave him the standard supportive treatment regimen for COVID-19. He was isolated with wife, Nina, at home for the first week of his symptoms. But apparently, the virus had mean plans. His fever spiked intermittently, with uncontrollable chills, temporarily relieved by antipyretics. His coughing went from bad to worse. The symptoms worsened further and he started feeling short of breath. His oxygen saturation in the blood was starting to dip. Nina and Dr. Meth convinced him to get admitted at a tertiary hospital near their place. While being transported in the ambulance, a lot of thoughts swirled in his mind. But all of them were appeased by a deep sense of calm. “I know the Lord was going to work out all things together for good for those who love Him and are called according to His purpose,” says Greco. His attending physicians (APs), pulmonologist Dr. Sveth Maguslog and Dr. Elaine Balleser, immediately requested for laboratory tests, which showed he had bilateral pneumonia, and a markedly low level of his immune blood cells. His indicators of inflammation or cell swelling in the body were all high, and his blood-clot indicator was elevated, suggesting that blood clots may be forming in his blood vessels. From the start, he told Nina and Dr. Meth that he was not willing to be isolated in the intensive care unit or to be intubated and hooked to a respirator. Remdesivir and the recommended or conventional protocol for severe COVID were promptly initiated. He went through a physical, as well as mental, roller coaster in the next few days, with no significant improvement noted in his symptoms and overall condition. Nina recalls that period as a week of tears, prayers and worries. She spent most of her free time praying. And as she was praying one time, she felt the Holy Spirit’s presence, which was like a soothing balm to her frayed nerves. A friend told Nina to call a Filipina critical care nurse based in Texas, who has an excellent batting average with her COVID patients, mostly high-risk seniors in Florida. Greco’s brother, Jeremiah, also called his doctor friends, to join the group, including myself, in a Zoom meeting to discuss Greco’s case. Greco was then in the dreaded hyperinflammatory stage of COVID. He already had the telltale signs and symptoms of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is like the Rubicon of many COVID patients, wherein turning back may no longer be possible, except for some blessed ones. The group made several recommendations, including stopping remdesivir, giving relatively high doses of ivermectin, melatonin, steroids, intravenous vitamin C, colchicine, and other natural immune system-boosting supplements like zinc, vitamin D and virgin coconut oil. Dr. Meth relayed the suggestions to Greco’s APs. She told them that she is convinced the treatment regimen, though unorthodox, could help him improve and recover. She pleaded with them to give the regimen a try; and they obliged. After 24 hours, there was not much improvement, and his oxygen level was precariously hanging in the critical zone, which indicated the need for intubation and assistance with a mechanical ventilator. But Greco remained mentally sharp and maintained his decision that he should not be intubated and isolated. The group agreed that Greco’s condition, based on his serial arterial blood gases, was heading ominously toward severe to critical, and since intubation with mechanical ventilation was not an option, we had to make some bold moves with a now-or-never urgency. It was clear that severe inflammation, no longer the virus itself, was the main problem at that point; and so, we decided to be aggressive with drugs that could help neutralize the inflammation. We decided to give leronlimab, a new repurposed drug that has to be imported abroad. Ivermectin was increased to its maximum recommended dose in severe COVID; melatonin was likewise increased to the maximum dose of 600 milligrams in four divided doses (usual dose as a sleep aid is 1-3 mg); vitamin C was given at 100-gram infusions per day, and his intravenous steroid dose was also doubled. Special-duty nurses were called in to assist at bedside so he could be closely monitored and his medicines given on time. COVID with moderate to severe ARDS requires precision medicine, as a small misstep can spell the difference between surviving and dying. The next 48 hours seemed like eternity. Nina was scared every time her phone rang. We gave Greco megadoses of all possible drugs that could help; but we believe that the real megablessing came from God. The COVID clouds hovering around him started to clear. Four days later, his oxygen level remarkably improved but still in hypoxemic range. He dressed up, propped himself up in front of his laptop and tablet, and led his staff at the PACC and other partner agencies in the virtual launch of the National Anti-Corruption Coordinating Council. His special nurse was subtly monitoring his oxygen saturation levels, and he was mildly hypoxemic the entire time he was leading the ceremonies and meeting with his staff and representatives of partner agencies. He refused to put on his oxygen nasal cannula, and played his mind-over-body game well. No one would have suspected they were meeting with a patient barely out of the dark woods of severe COVID-19. We told him later that we were sure everyone would have understood if he skipped the proceedings because of his condition. He answered: “I did not want to use my sickness as an excuse to not do what I promised the Filipinos I will do … That is my commitment and I will do that as long as I can.” Greco’s turning back from his COVID Rubicon is an inspiring story of what strong faith in God can do, especially when you feel you’re literally clutching at straws. “I know that it was God at work and things will work out,” says Greco now as he looks back. “I was confident because I was seeing God moving in everyone’s heart and putting different people together—whom we did not know but are helping us.” Despite his very low oxygen levels at some point, he remained conscious. “I generally knew what was going on—the situation and conflicts—because I was listening though half-asleep, but my mind was extraordinarily sharp. And I was determined to go through it and walk out of it.” Greco felt that the Lord was with him the whole time and was giving him glimpses of what would happen next. “That’s why there was no fear in my heart. But now learning what I went through, it would have been different if I knew the details of what I was going through then,” he says in jest. Aside from Greco and Nina, another revelation in his near brush with COVID death was his mother—Dr. Meth. Normally, doctors would not want to be involved in the treatment of a critically ill family member because one’s judgment and decision-making could be blurred. She actually served as the medical officer, coordinating with all of the doctors. Such nerves of steel were truly amazing. “It is all about God’s goodness and mercy,” she says. “I want to give Him all the glory.” Indeed, such calmness and composure amid a high-pressure situation involving your own son can only come from a deep connection with God. She shares: “So many times in the young lives of all my sons, death knocked, not once but many times. I had one son who died at age 1. From then on, I asked God, ‘Please, Lord, never again allow my sons to die before me’ … I draw my courage from Him in moments like these, knowing that there are human errors even in hospitals. I made sure my presence is felt like a hawk among hospital staff … My heart knew God will come through when my sons are in danger.” Indeed, God came through in Greco’s case, as faithfully as He promised He would for his people who trust in Him. This is the kind of faith and humility that our nation needs to express now, so we could allow God to come through for us, as well as He did for Greco.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
She has PCOS—this is her weight-loss journey,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388782/she-has-pcos-this-is-her-weight-loss-journey/,"11:49 PM September 24, 2021","‘Whenever I woke up, I had anxiety. When I changed my lifestyle, it all went away’ Jovi Tupas, 35, was fit and healthy for most of her adult life. But when the mobile ad tech sales head moved abroad for work, her health took a back seat. It didn’t help that she suffered from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder among women of child-bearing age that make it more difficult for the body to process insulin, the hormone that converts starches and sugars into energy. Women with PCOS tend to develop diseases like Type 2 diabetes and infertility. And weight gain becomes a constant struggle. Tupas came home to the Philippines just before the pandemic hit. Even as she was eating normal portions, she started to gain weight, tipping the scale at 190 pounds (86 kilograms). Reading an article that said women with PCOS, because they’re obese, are at a higher risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19, got her worried. That became her wake-up call. I work in the mobile advertising technology space that requires a lot of collaboration with stakeholders. My day is a normal 9-to-5 job but sometimes extends to longer hours. Weekends are a break for me. I work out or catch up on the newest show on Netflix/HBO Go/Apple TV+ or do my new hobbies like baking or painting. I got into healthy cooking and baking because I was so committed to my PCOS weight-loss journey. I now read the labels and ingredients of the food I consume. I was fit in my late teens to early 20s. When I moved overseas for work, my overall health was overlooked. I got diagnosed with PCOS in my late 20s and I became lazy to workout. The symptoms of my hormonal and metabolic condition worsened—weight gain, stress, anxiety, depression, acid reflux and hair loss. I just took prescription drugs to alleviate the physical pain and I couldn’t find information on the right type of diet or exercise for women with PCOS. It was a long journey. There were unwanted comments from people that “you’re getting big” or “you’re not like that before.” They were unhelpful. It’s something women like me have to deal with every day. I came home in November 2019 and started a new job right before the pandemic. And when the lockdown hit, I actually gained more weight from eating “normal food” and ordering food deliveries, plus the added stress. I was at my heaviest at 190 lbs. I never ate more than a plateful because I was aware of my condition, and yet I still gained. I read a medical journal that women with PCOS, being obese, have a higher risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19. That was my wake-up call and I decided to take action. In August 2020, I consulted with doctors, health professionals and wellness advocates. I spoke to an internal medicine doctor, an endocrinologist for all my blood and hormonal tests, then with a nutritionist-dietitian for my weight-loss program. I got an online fitness instructor for my strength training and an energy wellness coach to help me with the transformation mindset. In my whole journey, I got into holistic wellness. So I started a nutritional regimen, fitness routine and mindfulness practice. These are all virtual meetings and consultations and I would have these sessions on weekends, and before or after work. I lost 35 lbs (16 kg) in seven months and have maintained it for a year now. I do cardio, strength and yoga before starting work. My cardio is indoor cycling; I signed up with a cycling studio’s online classes for at least thrice a week. Strength training is twice a week. Yoga or stretching is once a week. I also need to time my workout. With PCOS, I actually gain more weight if my workouts are long and high intensity, so it has to be slow and low-impact. I try to make it four to six times a week. In the living room where I put up my indoor bike and connect my laptop to our TV and blast the speakers. If I am doing yoga or strength training, sometimes in my bedroom, too. Definitely my Schwinn IC7 indoor bike, mat, dumbbells, ankle weights, kettle bell, resistance bands. Hip-hop! A Kanye song or club music. Do you stick to a strict diet? My nutritional regimen is gluten-, dairy- and sugar-free. I usually eat lots of greens and leafy vegetables, organic chicken or fish, and berries. I also do a smoothie or prepare golden milk or chocolate milk using nut milk. I have stopped eating rice. I’m more worried about its negative effects on my body. I miss the taste of fast food or certain types of food. I look for alternatives in vegan restaurants, or in plant-based food. I try not to cheat because I can easily gain back 2 lbs (1 kg) the next day. That I wake up feeling OK. Prior to my transformation, my stomach was at its worst because, whenever I woke up or felt tired, I had anxiety. When I changed my lifestyle, it felt like magic, all the anxiety went away. If I feel it now, it’s because of self-induced stress, it’s not as severe as before. How did the pandemic affect your fitness routine? I signed up to a gym before the pandemic. I just miss the gym facilities like sauna, heated jacuzzi, swimming pool, machines like rower or steppers. Since the pandemic, I got more flexible and focused on body weight training and indoor exercises. Consistency and commitment is really the key to any goal. Start small. Before you can run a marathon, you have to walk first. So start moving at home or outdoors; outdoor biking is a trend now. And be mindful of your daily choices—from food, social media and the content that you consume. All of these affect your mental, emotional and physical health. Always remember, this is the time to practice self-love and self-care.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Revisiting the Hippocratic Oath,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388501/revisiting-the-hippocratic-oath/,"05:47 PM September 19, 2021","Could words ever capture the service every front-liner has provided in the desire to sustain and prolong the lives of Filipinos? “I swear by Apollo the Healer, by Aesculapius, by Health and all the powers of healing and to call witness all the Gods and Goddesses that I may keep this oath and promise to the best of my ability and judgment . . .” The Philippines has been alternating between different kinds of community quarantines for almost two years. The nation had believed that the first imposed lockdown would have lasted for a span of 15 days. The country was penetrated by the deadly coronavirus when one woman, who had unknowingly been infected, tested positive in her initial swabs. By March of 2020, over 600 people were suspected to have contracted COVID-19. “I will pay the same respect to my master in the science as to my parents and share my life with him and pay all my debts to him . . .” News about the virus and the lockdown spread, sending fear coursing through the veins of every citizen. People rushed to the nearest supermarkets and stocked up on supplies that would sustain them for the coming weeks. There was nothing people could do but exert all efforts into preparing and adapting to what life could possibly look and feel like the next day. “I will regard his sons as my brothers and teach them the science, if they desire to learn it, without fee or contract . . .” But this narrative was drastically different for health-care workers. Back then, scientific data was insufficient. No knowledge and information had been released as to how to battle the virus. Front-liners walked in blind. They worked with fear, not only for the people whose lives rested in their hands, but for themselves who were sent in like pigs out for slaughter. “I will hand on precepts, lectures and all other learning to my sons, to those of my master and to those pupils duly appointed and sworn and to none other . . .” The health-care workforce are not and should not be seen as superheroes. None of them possess any magical powers that would alleviate the circumstances for everyone else. Their eyes cannot cast laser beams that could pierce through walls, or have X-ray vision. They cannot heal people with a single touch. Instead, front-liners run around day and night, covered from head to toe in personal protective equipment, trying to save everyone within their reach. “I will use my power to help the sick to the best of my ability and judgment . . .” The flatlining tone from the heart monitor must be a devastating yet all too familiar sound to them. Sighs of exhaustion and frustration escape their mouths, as they add another load to the burden they carry on their backs. Another life lost, another number added to the mortality rate. Medical workers admit so many patients each day, and they are reminded of their own families who are tucked away safely at home. They cannot hug them and reassure them that the Lord will grant better days for all at His mercy. Instead, they hold tightly the hands of someone else’s loved one. “I will abstain from harming or wrong doing any man by it . . .” Despite the lengthy hours and the tremendous work put into making sure people recoved, they are not compensated properly. They endure work without receiving their allowance. Benefits are withheld, or not provided immediately, and the salary is barely above minimum wage. Numerous health-care workers have been infected by the virus. Many have unfortunately passed away. Some have joined the strike, protesting and pleading for more support and assistance. Their bodies can no longer take any more stress, they’re run down with fatigue. Their mental stability must be deteriorating by the hour. “. . .Whatever I see or hear, whether professionally or privately which ought not to be divulged, I will keep secret and tell no one. If therefore, I observe this oath and do not violate it, may I prosper both in my life and in my profession, earning good repute among all men for all time . . .” Gratitude should not be paid through inscription on stone walls. Honor must not be bestowed in exchange for a life unready to be given. Could words ever capture the service every front-liner has provided in the desire to sustain and prolong the lives of Filipinos and make sure as many of us as possible see through the end of the pandemic? Are words sufficient for the sacrifices made? Do they have the capacity to measure up against the losses health workers have endured for the gain of others? Each day is a battle, one that they have no certainty of winning. But with just enough might and will that every medical front-liner could muster, they choose to struggle for the welfare of this country. May the fruits of their labor burst with sweetness to supersede the bitterness of the sweat from their brow. “If I transgress and foreswear this oath, may my lot be otherwise.” —CONTRIBUTED INQ The author is a student at De La Salle University Manila.

Let destiny unfold itself,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388453/let-destiny-unfold-itself/,"05:01 PM September 19, 2021","“There are far, far better things ahead than any we leave behind.”—CS Lewis Start where you are and begin your self-exploration! I have been made to believe that, in a way, challenges make life interesting and that overcoming them is what makes life meaningful. We can’t really stress over what we can’t control, so my attitude is, believe in the process and make the most of what you can control with grace and integrity. Beginnings are beautiful. Whether it be the first page of a new book, the start of a new job, the beginning of a workout/diet program or even a decision to quit a toxic relationship. They can be different from what we are accustomed to, and it can be hard to adapt to change, but there’s just something so liberating, so freeing and so beautiful about new beginnings. When we say goodbye to some awful habits in the past and say hello to a healthier lifestyle, we look forward to a more worthy kind of existence. We may move to a brand new city with endless possibilities or start a fresh new business in a small town. Whatever the subject matter may be, experience has shown that starting up always brings a mixed sense of fear and excitement. Starting over brings a new set of people who could lift us up and motivate us to get out of our comfort zone. A new beginning could mean freeing ourselves of what cages us in, of what makes us feel less whole. Sometimes, though, a new beginning can also mean saying goodbye to a person, a career or a home that we don’t want to leave. Sometimes we don’t get to decide when our life switches gears and all we can do is hold on tight for the ride. One of the biggest life lessons I recently learned is that I, too, could be caught off guard. We aren’t always ready for change, and hardly do we ever want change, but our fear of the unknown will hold us back more than anything else in our lives—just like an anchor that weighs us down! We have to let go of our need to control the future and let destiny unfold itself. If we choose to stay and get stuck, then nothing big will ever happen. But if we decide that the future holds much greater things ahead than anything we may leave behind and we embrace that change, that’s when we will truly notice the beauty of new beginnings. I was not actually ready for a new beginning and was quite unclear about the new path I was headed, but thanks to hours of therapy in various forms, I was able to reboot and truly embrace God’s new plans for me. After a momentary pause from my “regular” life, I took time to rest my mind, body and soul and realign everything and focus on my new life purpose. It can be exhausting going through life without ever stopping and taking a deep breath, and it can have detrimental effects on our bodies. That’s why I truly value my Bikram yoga classes with Ollay Aninion, whether they are held in her studio Bikram Yoga Makati or online. Each yoga session gives me time to listen to my body and mind to keep that sense of harmony and balance. It’s like having an adult timeout where we put off everything and clear the air to start with renewed healing energy. And it’s easy to start one daily, even if you’re not sure what you want out of it. The thing with new beginnings is that they are starting and ending all the time. They aren’t always black and white, so we don’t always notice them, but changes happen in our relationships all the time. Because of these little changes, we are able to make the big changes, the changes that actually begin to affect our lives. We begin to notice what really makes us happy, what makes us actually feel important, and we want more of it. Changes are usually something we try to avoid. They’re uncomfortable and require us to make an effort. They force us to face our biggest fears, and push us outside our comfort zone. With all that I have experienced recently, change has been the greatest lesson in surviving challenging times especially during this unending pandemic. Next month would have been our Red Charity Gala (RCG) session. Unfortunately, my RCG partner Kaye Tiñga and I decided to end our successful 11-year charity event due to these difficult times. It saddens me to know that we won’t be able to donate to the worthy charities in the same capacity as we did in the past. As we adapt to change, we are now brainstorming to see what new beginning we could pivot into for the coming years. I am glad that Tatler Philippines continues to be on print and do a bit of charity as well. For its 20th anniversary, Tatler Philippines has chosen for its cover no less than the girl who brought home the gold, Hidilyn Diaz. The first ever Olympic gold medalist of the Philippines embodies the same excellence and influence that define this premier luxury magazine in the Philippines today. Since its maiden issue in September 2001, Tatler has been at the forefront of chronicling the best of power, influence and style not only in the country but in Asia and the world. There is so much to celebrate and be thankful for, which this anniversary issue captures in its over 200 pages. The story of Tatler headlines the list, of course, followed by the major moves that strengthened the brand, favorite covers, as well as memorable Tatler moments shared by personalities who have been featured and who have collaborated in creating this monthly epitome of elegance and style. Both management and staff are grateful for the continuous publication of the magazine in both print and digital formats throughout the pandemic. Editor in chief Anton San Diego says, “Pure gold does not fear the flame. We created some of the best issues in the last 16 months given the situation.” Managing director Irene Martel Francisco added, “In fact, the pandemic led us to more creativity in reaching out, effectively providing the impetus to boost the digital platform.” Rather than be daunted, Tatler was challenged by the huge limitations in producing such a highly visual medium. It pivoted to more meaningful and relevant features that added even more substance to its DNA. Successfully navigating this difficult time gives Tatler the confidence to face its next 20 years with rejuvenated strength, passion and commitment to delivering the best of the country and of the region.

Human caring will overcome whatever separates us,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388196/human-caring-will-overcome-whatever-separates-us/,"08:23 PM September 13, 2021","“We must remember that we belong to each other.”—Mother Teresa History repeatedly shines a bright light on the powerful nature of human resilience. We have all witnessed individual and community resilience in the months after 9/11, one of the most tragic events in American history. And, more recently, from our daily experiences navigating a global pandemic, we have all embraced the value of life, empathy and compassion for others. On the 20th anniversary of 9/11, we find the world once again stressed by fear. We are grappling with a different horror, a global pandemic seemingly without an endpoint, one that has killed millions in 21 months. Again, two decades later, we live with uncertainty and fear. We have learned that resilience is a shared response to traumatic events. Compassion and caring have defeated fear. Over time, human caring would overcome whatever separates us, especially with the acceptance of the new normal. In this global pandemic, conflict and division have taken a back seat in the war to save mankind from this deadly virus. All we need to do individually is to extend our hand with small acts of kindness. The way in which we deal with the stresses and our “new norm” bestowed on us by the pandemic could be an indication of how resilient we really are. Resilience is defined as the ability to withstand or recover from difficult situations. If we could spring back despite the odds, we would have been victorious and restored equilibrium in life. During these unprecedented times, I believe we all have had a good test of resilience. In general, most people have a large capacity for adapting and overcoming threatening events and experiences. While some individuals might be innately more resilient, there’s no doubt that resilience can be practiced and developed. Like the old adage says, “From all bad comes good,” and “When one door closes, another door opens.” After six months of life-shifting experiences, I feel a sense of empowerment and optimism to regulate emotions and remain resilient. I choose to live with compassion and trust the universe. My journey to the self in the last three months has brought me to different places rich with healing adventures here in North America. From Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Orange County, California, to New York City and Tucson, Arizona, I have evolved and grown emotionally and spiritually. It was wonderful to experience a bit of freedom from pandemic fear and enjoy a possible post-COVID lifestyle. I met lots of new friends and rekindled old friendships, especially with my Assumption High School ’81 classmates. New York City is slowly getting back its excitement and vibrancy. New York Fashion Week is alive, Broadway has reopened and the US Tennis Open had a full audience. My soul sister Vina Francisco is marking the 20th anniversary of 9/11 by being there. Emotional wellness has also been part of my journey here. Emotions are a gift from God, who created each of us with a capacity to feel and to express our feelings to others. For this reason, we need to know how to express our emotions in healthy ways, learn how to cope with negative emotions, direct our emotions toward good outcomes, and give voice to our feelings in order to improve communications. From denial to full expression, the spectrum of emotional growth is quite interesting. Emotional wellness is critical to our well-being and health. We need to manage our emotions effectively through challenges and change. Mindfulness is about self-awareness and accountability. It’s also about embracing all the goodness in your life and looking at your glass as half full rather than half empty. In knowing our core values, we can focus on what’s important to us and see life’s bigger picture. If we are emotionally stable, we have the strength to navigate the stressors in our lives, whether it’s through meditation, therapy, exercise or creative pursuits such as art, music, or writing. It’s the ability to maintain a balance between work and play. If we all try to maintain a good sense of emotional wellness, then this world will definitely be a better place. There’s no time like the present to begin! And if you can’t hug a person, go hug a tree instead! I am looking forward to going home soon especially to be with my kids again. I will share with them the new book of leading dermatologist Dr. Clarissa “Issa” Cellona. She recently launched the creatively executed “What’s Up With My Skin?” published by Summit Books. Inspired by almost 20 years of clinical and aesthetic practice, Doctor Issa wrote a guide not only for teens dealing with skin issues, but also for parents who encounter the same questions and concerns for their kids. Written by the founder of Skincell, a leading derma clinic, “What’s Up With My Skin?” includes a primer on skin issues most frequently encountered by teenagers such as acne, body odor, body hair, eczema, dandruff and more. There is even a section dedicated to cosmetics and whitening. Doctor Issa said: “Understandably, the challenges in managing teen skin can be very distressing not only to the young patient but to the parents as well … I wish to dispel all these skin myths and correct all the wrong information found on the less-than-trustworthy sources online.” Aside from leading her group of board-certified dermatologists and highly trained personnel at Skincell, Doctor Issa is also an active consultant at St. Luke’s Medical Center Global City where she heads the Environmental Dermatology Unit. “What’s Up With My Skin?” will be available at select Summit Books online partner stores, Skincell clinics and Skincell on Lazada.

Feeling disconnected from the world? Try touching some grass,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388181/feeling-disconnected-from-the-world-try-touching-some-grass/,"01:16 PM September 13, 2021","“Please go outside and touch some grass.” If you often spend your downtime on Twitter, then I’d assume you come across this statement at least once a day. It’s a viral meme typically used as a passive-aggressive comeback when somebody sends out questionable, borderline pointless tweets (such as tone-deaf political opinions or out-of-touch and insensitive comments). It’s a way of telling people that they need to unplug and bring their sense of reality back in check. But did you know that “touching grass” can actually be an effective way to reconnect with the world and take back control over your life? These days, so many of us are dependent on computers, tablets, and smartphones for entertainment and socialization. And it’s really not surprising, especially now that we’re approaching one year and eight months in lockdown. But this habit can result in feeling detached from reality, which may eventually hinder our ability to live a productive life. The good news is, we can overcome this feeling by literally touching some grass—may it be in a public park or our own backyards. And this particular technique is called earthing. Earthing (a.k.a. grounding) is a form of ground-based alternative medicine that claims to have beneficial effects on health through making direct contact with the Earth’s surface. As you touch or lie on the grass, the Earth’s electrons flow through your skin and into your body, electrically neutralizing positive-charged free radicals, a 2012 study on earthing found. This then creates an instant electrochemical reaction that can enhance the body’s immune and inflammatory responses. The same study noted that earthing can reduce risks of chronic stress, inflammation, insomnia, cardiovascular disease, and hypercoagulability, among others. It can also help boost productivity and improve overall mental state, according to 2018 research. The longer you are connected with nature, the better it works.  There are other ways to interact with the Earth’s surface sans grass. One, you can go barefoot outdoors. This is considered one of the easiest and most common forms of grounding. Two, try hydrotherapy. One 2014 study suggests that this technique can improve immunity and manage pain. Three, purchase an earthing mat. An earthing mat is usually made of polyurethane and is connected to an electrical outlet by a wire. It works by making a conductive connection between your body and the ground below it. Earthing mats were originally designed to be used out in nature where you could make contact with the ground on your bare feet, but they can also be used indoors on carpeted floors or wooden flooring as long as there’s an electrical outlet nearby. Similar to humans, animals (especially house pets) can benefit greatly from earthing. When you walk your pet around the neighborhood, it will automatically get in contact with the Earth’s electrons. “Many times when a cat or dog is ill, you will find them outside under a bush where they have dug a hole to rest in. My feeling is they are tapping into the energy field of the Earth and benefiting from the infinite source of electrons and other intrinsic healing properties of the Earth,” said a holistic veterinarian. In conclusion, your body doesn’t need wires from gadgets plugged into it in order to function properly. It rather thrives best when you’re grounded and connected with nature. So maybe it’s time to do what your Twitter friends suggest and touch some grass. Feel your fingers against it as it tickles your palm and gives you a reality check and some sense of belongingness.

Afraid of serious vaccine reactions? Melatonin may help,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/388052/afraid-of-serious-vaccine-reactions-melatonin-may-help/,"07:26 PM September 09, 2021","Getting a sufficient amount of sleep prior to vaccination strengthens the body’s immune response We have routinely advised all our patients undergoing vaccination to take a pure melatonin supplement preferably one to two weeks before the jab, and for the next three to four weeks after. This is repeated when they get their second shot. The rationale for this is that it may help prevent the excessive reaction and other side effects of the vaccine, and it may also help enhance the immune response, in terms of antibody production and immune memory following vaccination. Enhancement of response to vaccination is particularly important in the elderly because it’s an established fact that vaccines, in general, may not be as effective in the elderly, compared to younger adults. They have what is termed as immune senescence, meaning that their immune system is relatively weaker and the desired immune response to vaccination is relatively less. There is, therefore, a need to try to enhance their immune response involving the two parts of immunity, called the innate and cellular immunity. This is where adjuvant treatment with natural immune system-boosting agents like melatonin comes in. Our groups at the Manila Doctors Hospital and Fame Leaders Academy have been privileged to have closely worked with an eminent group of global scientists including professors Russel Reiter and Dun-Xian Tan of the University of Texas, Gregory Brown of the University of Toronto, and Harold Pupko in Ontario, Canada, on some research projects evaluating the usefulness of melatonin in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. We are convinced of the benefit the natural supplement can offer because of its potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects, which also account for its benefits in those undergoing vaccination. Our published preliminary report was acknowledged as the first report on the use of high-dose melatonin in actual COVID-19 patients. Several other reports followed, and there are now several large multicenter trials being conducted here and abroad to confirm its efficacy. Dr. Camilo Roa Jr. now heads the local group which is midway through its clinical trial involving several COVID-19 hospitals nationwide. Since it’s a double-blind trial comparing melatonin with placebo (dummy capsules), we don’t know yet the results until the last patient is enrolled and the results analyzed. The research is funded by the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD). We’re optimistic that the results will be positive, and that can be our country’s contribution in the global fight against this killer virus. Brown’s own group in Canada, together with Daniel Cardinali from the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, made a strong recommendation for those getting vaccinated to take melatonin supplements. In their scholarly article published in Melatonin Research early this year, they explained that based on prior experience with the influenza vaccine, up to 50 percent of vaccinated adults showed suboptimal or inadequate response, resulting in lack of effectiveness of the vaccine. They cited growing evidence that “insufficient sleep may potentially be a pervasive and prominent factor accounting for this variability.” They further explained that those experiencing total or partial sleep loss would have markedly reduced antigen-specific antibodies as compared to healthy sleepers. This was the reason, in our previous columns, we discouraged healthcare workers from getting their inoculation shots immediately after their duty day. This could possibly explain why a lot of our health-care workers are getting infected despite being fully vaccinated. Cardinali and Brown also stressed that prevaccination sleep quality is an important factor that may help determine resulting efficacy of the vaccine, and the unfavorable side effects that may be experienced. They said that melatonin enhances the immune response to vaccines by increasing the blood cells that produce the antibodies and the natural killer cells that engulf the virus, like in the Pacman game. They concluded: “Administration of exogenous melatonin could increase the potency of the immune response and the duration of the immunity induced by the vaccine. Besides, melatonin could also prevent adverse effects of the vaccination due to its antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties. Therefore, the administration of melatonin from two weeks to at least four weeks after vaccination may constitute an effective means to enhance the efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.” Reiter and Tan, who both belong to the elite group of most-cited scientists in the world, also affirm the comprehensive benefit melatonin can offer, both in the prevention and treatment of mild to severe cases of COVID-19. The two were instrumental in making us decide to undertake the ambitious local multicenter clinical trial, which is expected to be a global landmark study in the use of melatonin for COVID-19. They also agree that melatonin supplementation can enhance the immune system response following vaccination. There is no disagreement that a good night’s sleep—seven to eight hours every night— enhances immunity. Many are now experiencing sleeping problems because of too much anxiety caused by COVID-phobia, and this definitely weakens the immune system. “As COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed, it is of utmost importance that patients continue to prioritize their sleep to maintain optimal health,” said Dr. Kannan Ramar, president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, in a statement. “Getting sufficient, high-quality sleep on a regular basis strengthens your body’s immune system and optimizes your response to a vaccine.” Based on several studies, there is also a strong association between sleep and vaccination response. In a 2020 study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Medicine, immune system response to flu vaccines was observed to be more effective in those who had adequate sleep during the two nights prior to the vaccination. Similar findings were also noted in patients’ response to vaccination for hepatitis A and hepatitis B. A similar piece of advice on getting sufficient amount of sleep prior to vaccination was also given by Dr. Khurshid Khurshid, director of the Center for Neuromodulation at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in the United States. He explained: “The role of sleep in boosting innate and acquired immune response is significant. All people, particularly health workers, should be aware of the immunity-boosting effects of sleep. Studies have shown that normal sleep after vaccination strengthens the immune response against an invading antigen, and this immunity-boosting effect of sleep is clinically significant.” Various experts abroad recommend taking melatonin to improve sleep starting two weeks prior to vaccination to ensure that “the vaccine is taken in the midst of optimal sleep conditions—when your immune system is at its best.” They recommend that the supplement be taken for at least four weeks after receiving the vaccine to enhance the body’s immune response. They believe this could even increase the length of time a person has immunity to COVID-19 after being vaccinated. This can be a pragmatic solution to the rapidly waning efficacy of the vaccines after six months, especially with the Delta variant. There’s also a concern in young people less than 40 years of age getting vaccinated due to the cases of rare deadly reactions, like blood clots in women and myocarditis or heart swelling in young males. We have maintained our stand that healthy young adults are better off just boosting their natural immunity rather than taking the risk of serious vaccine side effects, but for those who really want to get vaccinated, we advise them also to take melatonin, so as to modulate their immune system response to the vaccine. Their strong immune system response is the one causing the potentially serious reaction, and melatonin can help modulate or temper this. Dr. Victoria Sharma, medical director of the Sharp Grossmont Hospital Sleep Disorder Center in the United States, affirms that melatonin may help fight COVID-19 by suppressing an overactive immune response. She also emphasizes that getting good sleep does wonders to improve immunity, “which can help the vaccine be more effective.” Sharma offers the following recommendations to improve one’s sleep: So, the bottom line, according to global experts, is that a good night’s sleep before and after vaccination can help bolster your chances of beating the virus.

Quality air is key to stop the spread of COVID-19,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387899/quality-air-is-key-to-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19/,"03:54 PM September 06, 2021","Over the past weeks, the Philippines breached the 2,000,000-mark of those who have been infected with COVID-19, and COVID Referral Centers like the Philippine General Hospital has announced that it will halt acceptance of non-COVID-19 patients as it recognized the need to open more beds with the rising cases, including that of the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. In light of this situation, the Department of Health (DOH) further emphasized the strengthening of efforts to combat the local transmission of the Delta variant in the Philippines through the implementation of stricter border control measures at the local level and augmenting the country’s healthcare capacity, it has repeatedly stressed that the best defense against any COVID-19 variant is still the correct and consistent adherence to the minimum public health standards and getting vaccinated as soon as possible.  However, as the country continues to slowly open the economy to jumpstart recovery, and as more and more people find themselves having been vaccinated against COVID-19, they will begin to venture outside their homes to resume their former activities that increase their risk of exposure and the possibility of infecting someone, especially after this third in a series of two-year-long lockdowns. Many will find themselves in their offices, malls, and other indoor spaces where particles from an infected person can move throughout an entire room or indoor space and can even linger in the air after the infected person has left the room. This was stated in an article published by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which further mentioned that the COVID-19 can remain airborne for hours in some cases, especially in enclosed, poorly ventilated areas. Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality and control airborne contaminants. When not enough air circulates, high levels of moisture, odors, gases, dust, and other air pollutants, and even viruses and bacteria build-up. The EPA article further stated that although improvements to ventilation and air cleaning cannot on their own eliminate the risk of airborne transmission, the EPA recommends increasing ventilation with outdoor air and air filtration as important components of a larger strategy aside from the adherence to safety protocols like the wearing of masks, physical distancing, especially in poorly ventilated areas. Key points to consider for quality air are as follows: In a quote from renowned epidemiologist Professor Raina Macintyre, an Australian expert in infectious diseases, “People are still stuck in that mindset of hand sanitizer and washing your hands when the actual message we need to be getting out there is it’s the air you breathe.” To find out more on how one can protect their homes, offices, and other areas against the resurgence of COVID-19, check out www.panasonic.com/ph/nanoe.

Age is just a number,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387803/age-is-just-a-number-2/,"05:36 PM September 05, 2021","“If you can’t figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose.” —T.D. Jakes  Did September just creep into our lives? Christmas carols will soon play while everyone is online shopping instead of “malling.” Oh, the weather outside is frightful! Clearly not because of the climate, this newest variant of COVID-19 is creating more havoc than its older brother. Earlier this year, I thought my birthday celebration in September would be more enjoyable and outrageous as I celebrate life with a sense of freedom and liberation from the pandemic. Unfortunately, one can never really plan the future and predict how things will unfold. How do we make good and sound decisions when truth and honesty are compromised? Yes, we can plan for the future, but we need to learn to adapt to change and be willing to let go of things that compromise our value and integrity. Aging must be a matter of acceptance rather than one of denial. We have to live with the highest regard for our well-being in order to live gracefully. To live with grace, we have to act with grace. In the words of Mark Twain, “Wrinkles should merely indicate where the smiles have been.” I want the marks of my age to tell the tales of my happy memories. It’s human nature to view aging as being based on appearance. But we can defy that. When it comes to aging gracefully, confidence plays a vital role. The most attractive accessory a person can have is self-confidence. As we accept that change is inevitable, we could prepare to keep a healthy mindset of being happy and authentic. Having a sense of humor is important, too, as life tends to be so stressful and depressing. Since age is just a number, we could keep our focus on the core purpose of our life and live healthy. Daily meditations and prayers help discover our fundamental reason for being. This purpose becomes more valid if we also improve the lives of others and make them feel good and special. Forgiveness is an important aspect that helps everyone live better. It doesn’t mean that we deny the other person’s responsibility for hurting us, and it doesn’t minimize or justify the wrong. Forgiveness is the intentional and voluntary process by which we undergo a change in feelings and attitude regarding an offense, thus we let go of our own negative emotions. And we all know how detrimental negativity can be. Being able to forgive allows us to heal. In aging gracefully, we need to always surround ourselves with love that we give and receive. Most women have no problem giving love but when it comes to receiving, we often feel selfish and undeserving. When we learn to receive and accept love, we become more satisfied and complete. We need to live while we are living, and be filled with joy, laughter and forgiveness. The goal is to love and be loved and to make a difference to someone. The longest-living people in the world know that eating well, staying alive and sleeping enough are keys to living a fruitful life. Studies show that maintaining strong relationships is also a pillar of life, such as in Okinawa, Japan, and Sardinia, Italy, where people enjoy longer, healthier lives than anywhere else in the world. Holding friends and family close can impact not only our happiness, but also our health span, or the number of disease-free years. Being social beings, many conditions, like hypertension, obesity, diabetes and possibly even cancer, could be lessened by being around people support groups. Whether it’s through a religious group, a book club, or a yoga studio, keeping relationships alive help impact our longevity and happiness. Falling in love can unleash intense emotions that naturally help keep our reason of being. I share my birthday with my soul sister Vina Francisco. She is a kindred friend who is on the same journey of a traveling and shopping life. We are somehow headed to the same hill of sharing fun times and good laughs. Twenty years ago, Vina was working for American Express in New York City when the World Trade Center towers were attacked on Sept. 11. She was among the thousands of New Yorkers who experienced this tragedy firsthand, not just as a spectator but as a survivor. As Vina retells her story, her memories of that day and the many trying months and years that followed are as vivid as if they happened yesterday. If there is anything we have learned through the current pandemic, we know that with tragedy comes trauma, and through Vina I also know now that it may also bring about life-altering personal and spiritual growth. In 2010, Vina relocated to Manila to join Asian Development Bank (ADB) as a human resources (HR) professional. Thus was born our friendship and the start of our soul sisters journeys as we share the same natal day, Sept. 6. Vina considers Sept. 11 a sacred day. For her it is a day of solitude and silence as she creates a 9/11 memorial in her home. She reconnects in various ways with her fellow survivors from all over the world to remember and pay tribute to all who were lost on that day. Since 2018, Vina has been the HR business partner for ADB in Pakistan and Afghanistan, two countries tied to Sept. 11. From being a 9/11 survivor, she is now also a development professional contributing in an HR capacity to alleviate poverty and hardship in these two countries. Suddenly, in her life there are new stories and perspectives. She’s moving forward. Her stories about Pakistan are fascinating, a world so remote and so removed from us that I can only visit vicariously through her travels. She often talked about future travels to the ADB office in Kabul, Afghanistan, but those trips never came to be. Because she has journeyed with me these past months on my own journey to self which brought us to America, Vina will, unintentionally, be in New York City on Sept. 11—the 20th anniversary of 9/11 and four weeks since Afghanistan once again fell to the Taliban. The past and present colliding. She had one wish for her birthday, and that was the safety of her ADB colleagues in Kabul. Because God is good all the time, that wish has, in fact, been granted.

Cognizant of this growing necessity, Robinsons Homes, one of the residential brands of the Gokongwei Group’s Robinsons Land Corporation, developing master-planned, gated subdivisions located in key cities nationwide, opened its doors to potential home buyers in its first-ever nationwide open house across its various locations held simultaneously last July 31, 2021. And with the Robinsons way, finding your dream home is more fun than anyone could have expected as the brand satisfied Filipinos’ K-Pop craze. The K-Tastic Open House generated excitement for sellers and potential buyers alike and added a dose of fun to Robinsons Homes’ open house events.  Married couples, families, parents and their children planning to acquire their dream homes, and investors looking to grow their wealth with new investments graced the event.  A total of eight clients purchased on the spot. Filipinos, old and young alike, have been fans of K-dramas, K-Pop girl and boybands, and even developed taste for flavorful and spicy Korean delicacies.

Now, having a home is more than just a place of shelter. I, it can also be a safe haven from pandemic diseases like COVID-19; double up as a makeshift office space when working-from-home; a venue for a new-found business; or even be transformed into a pseudo classroom for homeschooling. The need for open spaces and lush greeneries are also a must for mental and physical wellness as it gives more freedom for family members to breathe in fresh air and move around doing fun physical activities. Robinsons Homes offers a complete portfolio of horizontal projects that cater to a wide range of homeowners, from start-up to growing families aspiring to own their first home or upgrade to a better neighborhood.

I’ve worked my ass off and no one’s gonna stop me now,” the actress stated on her Instagram page today, Aug. 30. Bernal believes that fitness is way more than being healthy physically. She attests that by being conscious about her fitness, she has become “mentally stronger” too, “in ways [she’s] never pushed [herself].” “Fitness has taught me how to love working out solely for myself,” she added. Among other things she learned were how to stay balanced, and “core training for overall stability” which she said is “far more important than the idea of having ‘ABS.'” Bernal also feels that to be strong, one needs to go beyond just picking up weights.

The best eating strategies to manage your weight ,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387606/the-best-eating-strategies-to-manage-your-weight/,"12:13 PM August 30, 2021","What are your health and fitness goals right now? Do you have a strong motivation to improve your lifestyle, but still finding it difficult to begin? You might be so confused right now just by checking numerous diets available online. So let me share the most effective strategies that really worked for me and my weight management clients (backed up by research) since I started my fitness career in 2000. I always tell my clients to primarily focus on building healthy lifestyle habits to achieve lasting weight loss success. Always approach everything in moderation to achieve a balanced and sustainable lifestyle. I believe that the goal is how to find the ultimate healthy eating game plan based on your current lifestyle, food preference, activity level, and healths goals without feeling deprived. To achieve that feeling of fullness (7/10, 10 being the highest) and satisfaction (9-10/10), you need to eat flavorful meals consisting of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats filled with nutrients, vitamins, and minerals like brown rice, lean meat, seafood, chicken, nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables. Always have healthier alternatives so you won’t feel deprived. Instead of high-sodium seasonings and sauces, put some herbs and spices to your main meals like basil, thyme, cilantro, cumin, chili peppers, and turmeric. If you love desserts, instead of eating cakes and pastries, you can try to make your own sweets like plain yogurt with fruits, seeds, and nuts or a banana with almond butter. Give more time in creating delicious meals. Now is the best time to be resourceful and creative. There are so many healthy recipes that you can check online. Eat in one place like your dining area so you can focus on eating slowly and mindfully while enjoying your foods well. Of course, being with your loved ones can always make your eating experience a pleasurable one. Caloric restriction and skipping meals can negatively affect exercise performance and recovery. Proper spacing of meals (with the right amount and quantity) based on your activities can effectively regulate your eating throughout the day. If you wake up early, you can have a light breakfast, like a piece of toast with egg, 45 minutes to one hour before your morning workout.  Or you can eat your late breakfast/post-workout meal 30 to 45 minutes after your exercise class so you don’t experience intense hunger pangs during lunch. You can also have a light, pre-workout snack like a sweet potato three hours after lunch or 30 to 60 minutes before your afternoon workout that starts at 4 or 5 pm. If dinner is usually served late, you can have fruit and veggie smoothie with nut milk. Or you can just enjoy your dinner 30 to 45 minutes after your late afternoon or evening workout. One of the most effective ways to start your journey is to write down your daily food intake to increase your awareness about your food choices and eating behavior. You need to eat the most nutritious available foods on time and when hungry so you can mentally and function well. However, you might be eating some foods that can slow down your weight control goals like craving, habit, availability, current emotions, or social influence and pressure. Journaling can help you analyze the main reasons for eating some unplanned high-calorie meals like chips, sweets, and alcohol. Apply effective weight control strategies to avoid eating high-calorie foods for the wrong reasons. CRAVING – Always prepare healthier alternatives like fruit shakes or yogurt with cacao nibs to avoid sweet cravings. For crunchy food, you can eat healthy nuts like baked sweet potato chips, pistachios, or almonds HABIT -Break the habit of late-night eating by making sure that you always have a healthy and satisfying dinner. You can also modify your sleeping routine by going to bed early and avoiding late-night television watching. AVAILABILITY -Replace high-calorie foods available at home like chips and sodas with healthy unprocessed crackers and coconut water. EMOTIONS – Express your emotions through movement or by opening up with your loved ones, instead of eating high-calorie foods like cakes and cookies. SOCIAL INFLUENCE – Assert yourself and learn how to say NO to people who can sabotage your health and weight control goals. Learn how to ask for support from your loved ones or like-minded friends who can genuinely support you in your journey.

Self-care means getting enough emotional support,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387559/self-care-means-getting-enough-emotional-support/,"05:47 PM August 28, 2021","And animals can certainly provide this, as they’re sometimes used in therapeutic settings to help patients navigate challenging experiences “I have found that when you are deeply troubled, there are things you get from the silent devoted companionship of a dog that you can get from no other source.”—Doris Day Self-care isn’t a one-size-fits-all strategy. When dealing with a personal struggle, we need to create a shield of kindness and compassion to envelop ourselves from destructive reactions. Our self-care plan ought to be customized to our needs and what is going on in our lives, whether the process needs to emphasize physical self-care for a busy college student who feels mentally overstimulated, or social self-care for a retired person who needs a relationship. In both cases, self-care should be made top priority. Self-care is vital for building resilience toward stressors that we can’t eliminate. When we’ve taken steps to care for our mind, body and soul, we will be better equipped to live our best life. It is important to assess how we are caring for ourselves in several different domains so we can ensure our total well-being. Unfortunately, however, many people view self-care as a luxury rather than a priority. Consequently, they’re left feeling overwhelmed, tired and ill-equipped to handle life’s inevitable challenges. Because of this pandemic, mental self-care has been made top priority. It emphasizes the need to work on things that help us stay mentally healthy. Practicing self-compassion and acceptance, for example, helps us maintain a healthier inner dialogue. Mindfulness in a relationship is about observing what the other person is doing in a nonjudgmental way. It’s also about staying present in the moment during any conversation. Most emotional relationships are broken due to lack of communication. When that is flawed and both parties are not willing to listen unconditionally, the mental and emotional aspects will be difficult to repair. It has been observed that socialization is key to self-care. Close connections are important to cultivate in our daily lives. Unfortunately, this is often missed. One’s life is sometimes filled with so many activities that it is easy to neglect relationships. Ironically, even when the pandemic hit, making time for friends was still hard for some individuals. Spiritual self-care is also necessary to have a healthy life balance. Nurturing your spirit, however, doesn’t have to involve religion. It can involve anything that helps you develop a deeper sense of meaning, understanding, or connection with the universe. It’s important to have healthy coping skills to deal with uncomfortable emotions, such as anger, anxiety and sadness. Emotional self-care may include activities that help acknowledge and express feelings on a regular basis. When it comes to your mental and physical health, you need to make yourself a priority. Stop worrying about pleasing the person abusing you. Take care of your needs. Do something that will help you think positively and affirm who you are. Research suggests that having love and support from people in your life can have essential health benefits. This type of support can lower your risk for disease, improve your immunity, and decrease your risk for depression and anxiety Animals can offer an extraordinary amount of emotional support. Beyond the pet-owner relationship that many of us have lovingly experienced, animals are sometimes used in therapeutic settings to help patients navigate challenging emotional experiences. Your support system can help provide your much needed emotional support by listening to what you have to say, providing validation and helping you when you are in need. Your support system may even incorporate those from the animal kingdom. As we recently celebrated international dog day, it is only fitting that we highlight them as the preferred choice. Therapy dogs are pets that improve your health by giving emotional support. They are patient and unbothered by children who tug at their fur or adults who want them to sit in their laps. When I asked some friends to share their favorite dog photos and why they love their pet so much, many of them shared the same loving sentiments. Good friend Leah Caringal told me that George, her beagle, has been her companion for 11 years and is great with kids. Philippine Tatler editor Anton San Diego shared that Zach is the best mate to vent to, argue with and hug after a long day. Travel buddy Pepper Teehankee said that his French bulldogs give him so much joy and happiness and are truly loyal companions. Enterprising sisters Stephanie, Sofia and Mae Coyiuto recently started a virtual company to aid pet parents. This network is gaining so many pet lovers, sharing so many tips and resources. Pawplife is Manila’s first virtual pet care company, which aims to connect pet parents with vet expertise online. Their mission is to make pet parenting happy—dedicated to empowering pet parents to help their pets live longer, healthier, and happier. Pawplife also connects various communities together, like pet parents, vets, trainers, groomers, pet lovers, breeders, rescue shelters and many more.

What to do to prevent the Delta variant from replicating in your body,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387395/what-to-do-to-prevent-the-delta-variant-from-replicating-in-your-body/,"02:16 PM August 24, 2021","You can’t afford any delay. The virus has repackaged itself, with a different clinical presentation It’s fair to assume that, as you read this, the Delta variant is now the dominant variant in the country. The forecast we made in May seems to be on point, despite our health officials’ and experts’ optimistic outlook then and up to last month that there was no evidence of community transmission of this highly transmissible variant. By end of August, at least 80 percent of cases will be Delta, and by mid-September, 95 to almost 100 percent of cases will be Delta. The threshold point for Delta transmission has been attained while we slept a few months ago, and once a threshold point for transmission is reached, it’s like a dam that breaks, and all hell breaks loose. No lockdown, no matter how stringent, will stop Delta. We warned that the two-week lockdown will only temper a sudden spike of cases, but the downside is that it will extend the duration of the outbreak by another month or two. If we do nothing different from the vaccine-centric strategy plus lockdown we’re currently pursuing, we expect the number of new cases to be upward of 12,000, up to 30,000 a day until late September. This will be characterized by some regions recovering, as Delta ravages new regions. We may have a respite in the last quarter of the year, to be followed by another big surge, by another variant—possibly the Lambda—by first quarter of next year. As forecast, we’ll have recurrent cycles of health- and economy-ravaging surges, and periods of stability. We hope our health officials are convinced by now that banking mainly on mass vaccination to attain herd immunity is an illusion—a mirage in the desert. We need to modify the strategy. These breathing spells will get shorter and shorter, and the surges will become more and more frequent. This will be so until we patch up the chink in our armor, that is, preventive and early home treatment. We presented the forecast of a Delta surge and the basis for it to two high-ranking officials in early June with some recommendations to mitigate it. Since then, we were convinced there was no way we could prevent this variant from breaching our shores, but there were some doable, economical and cost-effective preparations—centering on chemoprophylaxis, early treatment, community response strengthening and mental toughness—that we could do to mitigate its effects, and prevent hospitalization and excess deaths. We were confident that Delta could just come and go like an ordinary seasonal flu outbreak, if we were amply prepared. It’s late, but better late than never. Our pandemic managers may wish to reread our proposals in our previous columns since March of this year, if they feel this pandemic is pushing them to a corner, and they’re running out of ideas on how to get our nation out of it. We remain confident that the window is still open just wide enough to squeeze ourselves through, and this could be remarkably felt in three months, with full effect in six months. If we institute some policy changes before we hear Jose Mari Chan sing his Christmas carols—which usually starts by September—then we just might be able to enjoy our Christmas this year. Last week, we offered 12 important things to do promptly to stop Delta dead in its tracks. We don’t have to wait for any change in government policy to implement the treatment guidance, like a do-it-yourself survival guide. We believe that around 50 percent of the population could afford to implement the preventive and early treatment guidance. We received much encouraging feedback for the guidance since we started circulating it. And our request is that if you benefited from it, or strongly believe that it could help stem the tide of COVID-19 in our country, please sponsor one or two indigent families, so they may also be protected. A few nonprofit foundations, such as For God’s Glory Foundation (tel. 88920723) and Concerned Doctors and Citizens of the Philippines have pledged to help in increasing access of the poor to this preventive and early treatment guidance. You may also wish to help these foundations. When you help in getting others protected, especially those who can never pay you back for the things you do for them, that act of kindness by itself boosts your immune system and reduces your risk of getting infected. Don’t ask us for any randomized clinical trials to support that; just trust that God will reward you for your kindness and He will. When you focus on helping others, instead of worrying 24/7 for your family’s safety, your fears and worries diminish, realizing how much better off you are in surviving this pandemic, compared to so many millions in our population. We explained in previous columns that the Delta variant is so infectious that when one member of the household gets sick, in all probability, the entire household will get infected. We’re now treating several families where everyone, from the octogenarian grandparents up to the months-old great-grandchildren, are confirmed positive for COVID-19. Our early treatment protocol strongly recommends that once one household member develops symptoms, he or she should be isolated immediately, and everyone else in the household should take prophylactic treatment. The delay in waiting for the nasopharyngeal swab and other laboratory results allows the virus to spread quickly in symptomatic as well as still asymptomatic household members. Remember that Delta has a viral load that is more than 1,000 times the original variant, and is at least 60 percent more infectious than the already highly infectious Alpha or Beta variants. So, you can’t afford any delay in preventing it from replicating in your body. Delta deceives many into thinking it’s just an ordinary cold or sore throat, since fever is usually not present in the first few days. Disabuse your minds of the notion that COVID-19 will make you lose your sense of smell or taste, develop diarrhea, or experience muscle pains and weakness. That model has been phased out. The virus has repackaged itself with a different clinical presentation. Once you develop a cold, headache and sore throat at this time, there’s a 90-percent probability you have Delta. If you have additional symptoms of cough and fever, the probability increases to a near-hundred percent.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"As she struggled to breathe, her mom was also fighting for her life",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387291/as-she-struggled-to-breathe-her-mom-was-also-fighting-for-her-life/,"06:01 PM August 23, 2021","‘More than the physical symptoms of COVID, the hardest part was the mental and emotional torture’ There’s nothing more agonizing than being stuck in a hospital bed, too exhausted to move and struggling to breathe, knowing that your mom is next door, also fighting to stay alive. On July 27, Maritess Reyes and her mom, Lolita Garcia, tested positive for COVID-19. The diagnosis was not a surprise. Reyes stalled getting swabbed long enough, dismissing that the unpredictable weather caused the onset of her fever and cough 10 days earlier. Reyes lives with her mom and 12-year-old daughter, and all three always took extra precautions. They never leave home, and she works remotely. The only time she would go out was to take her mom to the hospital for her chemotherapy. Garcia also thought she only caught the cough from her daughter. They did not lose their sense of smell and taste, symptoms often associated with COVID-19. If anything, their sense of taste intensified. A little salt on their breakfast eggs would taste like the ocean; a dash of coco sugar on their oatmeal tasted sickly sweet. So, after teleconsulting with a pulmonologist and no medication could relieve them, they brought themselves to the MakatiMed emergency room. Reyes said that booking an ambulance took forever, and when they finally did, there was too much paperwork needed. So they took a Grab. In the ER, they waited 18 hours to get rooms in the COVID ward. “More than the physical symptoms, more than catching your breath and the pain of every needle, the hardest part was the mental and emotional torture. I was stuck in my hospital room while my mom fought for her own life in the other room. And I couldn’t do anything but pray and cry,” Reyes said told Lifestyle. Their quiet life was rudely interrupted, and an unshakeable fear took over. Reyes bargained with God and Padre Pio: “Ako na lang. ’Wag na si Mommy.” Garcia, 65, feared for her granddaughter’s life (the little girl tested negative and was quickly transported to the province). She said COVID-19 was worse than a total hysterectomy and chemotherapy put together. The blood gas analysis alone, performed a few times each day, was painful beyond words. Getting blood samples from the artery, usually inside the wrist, is more painful than drawing blood from the vein. But the blood oxygen level test was necessary, often done more than twice a day. Garcia was immunocompromised and had it a lot worse than her daughter. It was excruciating to breathe. COVID-19 sapped her energy. She couldn’t even move in her bed, and the tubes inserted in her, including a large breathing apparatus, made it almost impossible even to eat her meals. “I had to wait for the nurses na sobrang busy din sa dami ng patients para tulungan ako kumain,” she said. Garcia remained hospitalized for almost three weeks, while Reyes was discharged after five days. “She’s young and has no comorbidities,” her mom said. “I surrendered everything to God. Pakiramdam ko throughout kasama ko si God. Parang binubulong nya sa akin na lumaban ako, kaya ko. Lalo na nung sinabi ng doctor na kapag ’di tumaas yung oxygen level ko, mai-intubate ako.” Both were not vaccinated. Reyes said they were waiting to get jabbed until her mom finished her chemotherapy. Ironically, Reyes said they probably caught the virus on a Grab ride to her mom’s fifth chemo. The experience was no less harrowing for Reyes. “’Yung balik-balik yung doctors and nurses sa room ko to have me sign waivers to do this and that for Mom, like intubation and hemoperfusion, strong and expensive medications, while I couldn’t see her because I was still on oxygen support myself,” Reyes said. Plus, she was also worried about the hospital bills. In the ER, Reyes had already maxed out her health maintenance organization coverage (HMO). Lab tests and blood screenings cost over P20,000 per. Remdesivir, a COVID-19 drug, cost P45,000 for five doses. Reyes got five, her mom seven. The nurses also injected her mom with Axera, a medicine for pneumonia, at P6,500 per vial; she received 19. The personal protective equipment alone, at around P1,700 each, totaled about P145,000. “I said, I don’t care about the bills. Magkautang-utang na tayo basta makalabas kami nang buhay,” Reyes said. “’Yung pera kikitain ulit. Not easy but push lang. Kapit lang.” Before COVID-19, Garcia was already paying a lot for her chemotherapy. “Hindi kami mayaman. Sakto lang; working class. I chose to go to MakatiMed because my mom’s cancer doctor was in MakatiMed.” Even while apart, the women remained strong for each other. Reyes witnessed how her mom fought to stay alive in the ER. She held on to this image to draw strength, to survive the ordeal. “Mom is a fighter, so I should be a fighter, too. I also thought of my daughter. I had to fight for her. I have to be alive for her,” Reyes said. As soon as she was discharged, Reyes quickly packed her stuff and went to her mom’s side. “I regret not getting vaccinated earlier. I also regret not getting a swab test as soon as I had a fever. Even after you are tagged ‘recovered,’ your body isn’t the same as before. Until now am having lingering symptoms like brain fog, insomnia, cough, rashes. I feel my body doesn’t function well the way it used to,” Reyes said. —CONTRIBUTED INQ The mother and daughter’s hospital bill is over P1.4 million.

The 17th Cinemalaya: Extraordinary filmmaking in volatile times,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387283/the-17th-cinemalaya-extraordinary-filmmaking-in-volatile-times/,"06:01 PM August 23, 2021","The streamed showcase of independent films, of emerging directors and storytellers, produced its share of surprises A discarded face mask loses its purpose after its “boss” tosses it into the bin. It transforms into a small anthropomorphic figure and searches for its human, only to find its previous owner in the company of a sturdy new mask. The poor, blue disposable mask wanders aimlessly until it finds company. “Maski Papano,” directed by Glenn Barit and Che Tagyamon, was among the many short films in this year’s Cinemalaya whose stories focused on the novel coronavirus—a topic that is nigh impossible to ignore due to its immense impact on society and individuals. “As we open our most anticipated independent film festival, there is a lot of sadness—sadness as we mourn the passing of friends, colleagues; sadness because we miss the live camaraderie in exchange after we view the films at the Cultural Center [of the Philippines], the satellite movie theaters; sadness at our lack of mobility that makes us worry about the future,” Cinemalaya Foundation Inc. president Laurice Guillen said during the opening of the festival. The 17th Cinemalaya is a showcase of independent films, of emerging directors and storytellers, of outstanding filmmakers, but the pandemic still looms large amid the celebration. The opening day, which kicked off on Aug. 6, was launched coincidentally on the first day that Metro Manila and nearby provinces reverted to lockdown anew. Its movies are once again available through streaming platforms, making the festival viewing experience an altogether individual affair. But while the audiences of this year’s Cinemalaya are cooped up in their homes, watching behind a small screen and scanning through dozens of titles available for streaming, they will find that many of the short films in this year’s competition lineup tell a collective experience from the most surprising of perspectives. Stories of the pandemic, for one, came from varying standpoints: a grandmother, a man stranded on a small planet, local carinderia owners and a stressed-out kasambahay. “Maski Papano” took on a rather heavy topic, but it provided a quirky spin that brought laughs without diminishing the very real effects of the pandemic. In a matter of five minutes, the prop-heavy short film tackled the loneliness of isolation and the sudden disappearance of job security. “An Sadit na Planeta (The Little Planet)” also revolved around the shared experience of isolation. Arjan wakes up and finds himself on a planet so small he can see the start and the end. The 12-minute film in Bicolano is shot entirely using a 360-degree camera. “During this pandemic, we felt the shrinking of our world. We were not able to do a lot of things, we could not step outside. Ironically, our world shrunk at the time when our problems became bigger, we became more worried,” director Arjanmar Rebeta said in a video uploaded on his Facebook page. The film was among the big winners in the awarding ceremony on Thursday, taking home the Audience Choice Award, Special Jury Award and Netpac Jury Award. The all-encompassing effects of the pandemic were also explored in “Namnama en Lolang (Grandmother’s Hope)” and “Ate O.G.” The five-minute film “Namnama en Lolang,” shot using a smartphone, “preserves the memory of our experiences, the pressing issues and the hurdles we need to face during this health crisis,” according to director Jonnie Lyn Dasalla. The film is a reminder of the lives lost during the pandemic, and puts a face to the families left behind by the people who succumbed to the disease. “Ate O.G.” tackles the emotional and mental aspects of the crisis through the life of a trusty kasambahay stuck in quarantine with two rather spoiled young adults. Ate, as the kasambahay is referred to, turns to gardening (like many people did at the start of quarantine), while attending to the needs of her employers. When she becomes increasingly distracted, anxious and stressed, she turns to an all-natural “medication.” Beyond the emotional toll brought by the novel coronavirus, director Kevin Mayuga also explores class divide, something that has become even more evident during the lockdown. The documentary “Ang mga Nawalang Pag-asa at Panlasa,” meanwhile, focused on the mom-and-pop shops in Ilocos that offer the best dishes from the region. Directors Kevin Jay Ayson and Mark Moneda also focused on how these small businesses—like many restaurants around the world—struggled during the pandemic. Aside from the health crisis, the films in the main competition explored the many aspects and complexities of being Filipino. “Beauty Queen,” which was awarded Best Short Film for “presenting to today’s generation a shining paragon of beauty and bravery,” tells the story of Filipino hero Remedios “Kumander Liwayway” Gomez. The historical drama starts in 1940 Pampanga, when Gomez is crowned in a beauty pageant. But Gomez sets aside her crown to join the guerrilla movement in World War II—breaking gender stereotypes in more ways than one. “[It’s] important for people to know more about Kumander Liwayway, and this is a step in the right direction,” director Myra Aquino told the media after the awarding ceremony. The FiIipino filmmaker who was raised in Guam said that the minimal exposure to inspiring women led her to tell stories of Filipino women. “Beauty Queen” was filmed before the coronavirus hit the country, but the postproduction was done remotely during the lockdown. She added that it would have been difficult to shoot amid a raging pandemic. Another short film that earned the approval of judges Sigrid Andrea Bernardo, Jeffrey Jeturian and Aruna Vasudev is “Kids on Fire.” This dark comedy is about the sexual awakening of a prepubescent boy during a religious summer camp. “Kids on Fire” was awarded Best Screenplay and Best Direction. Director Kyle Nieva said that his team took a risk of making a coming-of-age film that discusses a very sensitive topic that is normally taboo in a religious country like the Philippines. But he added that it’s important to talk about sex, especially with the rising number of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Another film that explores faith and sexuality is “Ang Pagdadalaga ni Lola Mayumi.” The 20-minute drama starts with Lola Mayumi, the town’s pious old maid, checking into a motel for her first brush with intimacy. Young director Shiri de Leon drew inspiration from her experience of growing up Filipino, where it is often taboo to talk about sex. Life and religion are also at the heart of “Kawatan sa Salog,” a mystery/drama about a poor boy who drowns and finds himself in the afterlife. Director Alphie Velasco said that the film is based on his visits to his mother’s hometown, Caramoan, and the days spent with his late grandmother. Coming-of-age film “Looking for Rafflesias and Other Fleeting Things,” meanwhile, tells the story of Gubat, a tikbalang that transforms into a teenage boy. Gubat retreats to the mountains where he meets an American botanist searching for the titular parasitic flower. In the director’s note, filmmaker James Allen Fajardo said that the film “attempts to deconstruct the representation of tikbalang as often depicted as dangerous creatures in films, literature and other forms.” Many of the films in this year’s competition were visually pleasing, but “The Dust in Your Place” finds strength in the art of conversation. The 20-minute drama is about a comic strip artist who breaks down why her writer’s relationships keep failing. The film is directed by David Olson. The two suspense films in the main competition, meanwhile, were both gripping and emotionally taxing—in a good way. “Crossing,” directed by Marc Misa, is about a security guard who, out of desperation, attempts to declare a holdup in a passenger bus. When he finally wills himself to carry out the criminal act, two other men start robbing the passengers. The film was more than just crossing the lines between good and evil. Misa said in the director’s notes that he hopes his viewers would look into the motivations behind people’s actions. “The result of failing to recognize the complexities of human beings is often stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice,” he said. “Out of Body,” directed by Enrico Po, is about aspiring model Elle who finds herself on the set of a macabre commercial shoot. She’s kept in the dark on sudden changes to the storyboard, forced to wear lingerie and in the process systemically loses her agency in the industry. The short film draws the viewer in as Elle is pressured into uncomfortable situations by people who all claim to be on her side. Producing a film during a global health crisis, while public health measures are enforced and situations are uncertain, is extraordinary as it is, said veteran director Jose Javier Reyes. “To all the finalists of [the 17th] Cinemalaya, congratulations! Congratulations in the sense that it was quite a feat to come out with these films considering the very delicate and volatile conditions of filmmaking at this time,” the head of competition said. The 17th Cinemalaya is available for streaming until Sept. 5, for a total of four weeks—its longest run yet. Around 100 titles are available on streaming platforms ktx.ph and Vimeo. Aside from the main competition, viewers also have the chance to see critically acclaimed films, like “ECQ Diary (Bawal Lumabas),” “Lockdown,” “Kintsugi” and “Don Filipo.” The 2021 documentary “Tao Po,” by Mae Paner, and the 2020 drama film, “He Who Is Without Sin,” by Jason Paul Laxamana, were among the Premieres in this year’s festival.Visions of Asia, which features outstanding Asian films like “Mosul My Home” and “Bandar Band” are also available for streaming. True to its theme of “Navigating Currents,” the film festival introduced this year Cinemalaya Institute—a film lab that will prepare semifinalists before they shoot their films. “The film lab and the training programs are a carefully thought-out response at this time to the new trends, new prevailing conditions and new professional demands on our filmmakers. We believe and sincerely hope that they will be of significant help when our new filmmakers begin to film in the ‘new normal,’” Guillen said during the start of the festivities.

Gretchen Fullido battles anxiety by caring for her plants: ‘Always therapeutic’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387181/gretchen-fullido-battles-anxiety-by-caring-for-her-plants-always-therapeutic/,"07:14 PM August 19, 2021","TV news anchor and certified plantita Gretchen Fullido finds it “therapeutic” and healthy to attend to her plants during her free time. Fullido spoke about how gardening eases her mind via her Instagram page yesterday, Aug. 18, as she posted a photo of her plants. “Re-arranging my plants has always been soooo therapeutic for me. Yes, the house is still a jungle but trying a different approach this time,” she said. Fullido explained why she particularly has to “fix” the area she showed.   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Gretchen Fullido (@gretsfullido)  “[This] is one corner where the plant babies get natural sunlight (afternoon sun) — the other plants are scattered in other parts of the house and in my “propagation center” — aka the guest room, bathroom, by all the windows [and] other rooms,” she said, promising to show more photos soon. “This is how I battle anxiety…” she added. “For me, indoor gardening, propagating, rearranging and moving my plants around the house is how I feel productive when I’m at home — all year ’round aside from decluttering (major major decluttering this ECQ season 3).” Aside from being a plantita, Fullido is also a known animal rights advocate and supporter of environmental causes.

Your mess can cause distress: Decluttering as self-care,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387100/your-mess-can-cause-distress-decluttering-as-self-care/,"05:53 PM August 16, 2021","Your mess can cause distress. Living in a cluttered environment directly contributes to feelings of angst and anxiety. American Council for Exercise (ACE)-certified health coach Stacey Colino and the Benilde Well-Being Center of the De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde both believe that decluttering—both the process and the results—promotes health. Colino is an award-winning writer specializing in health and science. Her work has appeared in The Washington Post, Newsweek and Good Housekeeping. She said, “Tidying up can help you de-stress, gain a sense of control, and improve your state of mind in numerous ways. If it puts you at ease, it can be an important part of self-care.” Here are some pointers on how to declutter for a better mental state: •Clutter reduces productivity. A disorganized environment may impact attention, concentration and focus. It may even drain cognitive resources. An overabundance of possessions is a result of overattachment. It may foster chronic procrastination. Living in a crowded space can reduce productivity. • Clutter affects both physical and emotional well-being. Excessive physical things negatively affect subjective happiness. Our home should be considered our safe space. Piles could be magnets to bugs and bacteria. Wires on the floor may be accident hazards. •Clutter affects our health. A chaotic kitchen can contribute to an unruly mindset. Disorganized kitchens may facilitate a choice of higher calorie snacks over healthier options. This causes weight gain and poses other health risks. • Decluttering brings a sense of freedom and liberation. Getting rid of unnecessary belongings manages symbolic pollution. Put away miscellaneous physical things. Place them where they belong. This makes it easier to locate items at home. It likewise gives a new sense of being in charge. Doing these helps us feel more confident, efficient and accomplished. • Decluttering gives us a fresh start. It removes visual interruptions. It cleanses our palate. It allows us to have a fresh start in a more organized space. • Clutter is a spectrum. Individuals differ on the clutter they can tolerate. Decluttering can also go overboard. It is important to find what works for us. Be flexible enough to dial back when appropriate.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Student designs solar-powered cooling vest for field workers,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387097/student-designs-solar-powered-cooling-vest-for-field-workers/,"05:51 PM August 16, 2021","Young innovator Kristian Rafael Tan aims to improve the working environment of outdoor field workers such as those in construction, couriers and even cyclists, through Sunsoon, a solar-powered cooling vest. Conceptualized with the philosophy of form and function, the project provides the workforce with gear that lowers the body temperature of the wearer and provides cooling sensation for up to eight hours. Designed for those on-the-go, it targets hardware companies, contractors and company owners who may distribute the product among its workers. Made with water-and-heat-resistant woven polyester, the piece features thick Velcro shoulder pads, adjustable straps, double-woven layer pockets and a detachable 140-mm case fan. The system is powered by a solar panel unit comparable to gas-powered generators. Tan hopes for the regularity of safety equipment to prevent heat-related health risks and illnesses to workers. He likewise stresses the importance of solar technology as renewable energy plus a reduced environmental footprint. His design was recognized with the Best Thesis Award at the Industrial Design Program of De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde School of Design and Arts. Tan believes his solar-powered cooling vest may still be improved by larger companies with better technology. “If I were to develop my concept myself, I could wait until such technology is publicly accessible. But as it is now, I can contemplate on it as a reminder to continue designing for those who truly need it,” he said.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"I want that ‘sablay,’ UP ‘kong mahal’",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387095/i-want-that-sablay-up-kong-mahal/,"05:49 PM August 16, 2021","Student laments the hardships of distance learning but finds determination to keep going COVID changed everyone’s lives, schools shifted from traditional face-to-face class to online setup, and highways that were once occupied with rushing vehicles have become ghostlike streets. My daily routine changed. I no longer needed to set my alarm at 5 a.m., I didn’t need to rush ironing my uniform at the eleventh hour, and my sister and I stopped fighting over who’s going to use the bathroom first. At night, only the barking of the dogs gave life to our surroundings. No more videoke and tagay-tagay in the neighboring houses. There were no more children roaming around our village, asking to play tumba lata. The rusty sardine can that they used remained in the same spot where they usually spent their time after class and during weekends. My sister and I used to play badminton in a small yard in front of the house at 4 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. But not anymore. I became severely hooked on social media. My phone screen was my companion from early in the morning until midnight. I also watched 10 K-dramas at the height of the pandemic. Eventually I felt bored and sick of living with that kind of routine. I felt that it affected my health and caused me sleeplessness. I was carrying the weight of my fears and overthinking. One night, it was past 2:30 a.m. and I still couldn’t fall asleep no matter how hard I tried to close my eyes while I listened to Christian songs. I pulled my hair as hard as I could and cried under my pillow. When morning came, nothing changed. It took me three weeks to recover from that night, a battle that I conquered alone. I started to divert my attention to writing poetry and practicing Chemistry problems because I thought at the time that I would be taking up BS Chemistry in college. Nothing compared to the happiness that I felt when I passed the Upcat (University of the Philippines College Admission Test). UP is my dream university and passing the test was a great blessing from above. However, I wasn’t accepted to the degree program that I wanted. And my first year in UP would be through distance learning. Still, I enrolled in UP. But I had hesitations. I worried about time management, the internet connection, my intellectual capacity, and my sleep patterns. During the first week of class, everything ran smoothly and I was so eager to do my tasks and pass everything on time. But as online classed continued, I slowly lost interest. It became so draining and it consumed all my energy. I became so irritated with the unstable internet connection and I always felt panicked. There were times during synchronous class that I could hardly hold the computer mouse because my hand was shaking so hard and I could not control it. I barely talked during Zoom meetings because I didn’t have the courage. I completed tasks just for the sake of compliance. I always had to tell myself “bahala na ’to, at least tapos na.” I’ve been trying my best not to fall apart and not to put my emotional, mental and physical health at stake. It’s my foundation in life that keeps me going. Now, I give ample time to myself. When I feel tired, I take a break and rest to regain my energy. It is essential. When my eyes seem too heavy, I take naps. I sleep as early as 9:30 p.m. When my shoulders feel numb, I do stretches. When I don’t have the energy to do my schoolwork, I turn off my laptop and binge-watch K-dramas. The pandemic has been filled with heartaches and silent battles. But it also taught me to take things easy and value life. I want that sablay, UP kong mahal. Despite the struggles I’ve been through, I find myself smiling from ear to ear again as I imagine myself wearing that sablay and walking along the aisle of the university atrium. —CONTRIBUTED INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Making this a time of discovery,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/387064/making-this-a-time-of-discovery/,"05:22 PM August 16, 2021","“If you travel far enough, you’ll eventually meet yourself.”—Joseph Campbell, “Myths to Live By” The year 2021 seemingly began as a more productive one compared to 2020, a year that upended many expectations and routines. At the rate this new variant is spreading, life as we knew it has come to a halt once again. How can we remain engaged and motivated? Patience and persistence empower us to stay focused on the issues at hand. Keeping track of even the smallest accomplishments by journaling helps. So does staying mindful while making it a time of discovery. Cultivating a fun and inquisitive approach will make the process more enjoyable and give you more success. On my journey to self, I found myself traveling to the all-inclusive Miraval Resort, a luxury wellness oasis where guests go to reboot their mind, body and spirits. Located at the base of the Catalina Mountains in Tuscon, Arizona, Miraval is a global leader in destination wellness resorts and spas, dedicated to inspiring life in balance through mindfulness. Miraval offers many wellness and fitness options including yoga, outdoor activities, and eye-opening wellness workshops facilitated by among the best in the field of mental, emotional and physical wellness. The peaceful resort features swimming pools and hot tubs, a cutting-edge spa, and a state-of-the-art gym. Programs can also be customized based on personal goals and intentions. Healthy eating is also a cornerstone of Miraval, and all meals, snacks and smoothies are included in your stay. Soul sister Vina Francisco arranged and helped curate my four-day program based on my intentions. We prepared for Miraval Mode (the state of consciously unplugging from devices and becoming more digitally mindful). The initial challenge was to really detach from our cell phones as no digital devices were allowed in most public areas. This practice made us focus on living in the present. Among the several enlightening programs I had was a two-hour equine therapy with Acacia, one of the 14 horses at Miraval. I was guided by equine therapist Tyler Thompson. Equine therapy is a powerful way to get in touch with your thoughts and feelings, learn to set boundaries, and learn how to communicate and manage these effectively. Horses have a unique ability to sense emotions and react accordingly. Witnessing the horse’s response promotes self-awareness and can help people see themselves in a more realistic way. I also challenged myself physically and mentally by swinging on ropes to traverse a cable suspended 35 feet above ground. The outdoor course tagged Desert Tightrope was very physically challenging, but the experience also opened me up to personal realizations that, just like the equine experience, are important for my journey to self. Meditation is also an important component of my journey. At Miraval, I had a very special meditation curated by Lyndi Rivers, integrative health specialist, where I meditated on my past, present and future while walking though a labyrinth. One of my most comprehensive sessions that certainly came with significant “aha” realizations was a holographic memory resolution session with Brent Baum, Miraval’s longest serving wellness specialist. Using personal memories from childhood, early adult and present adult life to understand emotional and behavioral patterns can certainly bring about life-altering changes. In the local scene, The Farm at San Benito is a magnificent eco-luxury holistic health resort offering comprehensive, science-based, evidence-based medically supervised health optimization programs and life-changing retreats based on five healing components: holistic integrative medical services, nurturing spa treatments and hydrotherapy water wellness, plant-based vegan cuisine, mindful movement and functional fitness, as well as a healing environment and heartfelt service. Their expert staff of licensed medical professionals, nutritionists, living food experts, spa therapists, fitness coaches and yoga teachers will devise an all-inclusive personalized program from their enormous range of therapies and facilities to help you combat the stresses and disorders of modern life. The Farm’s world-class facilities and services have made it a recipient of 60 prestigious international accolades, including “Best Medical Wellness Resort in the World.” Another local wellness destination is the Aegle Wellness Center in Balesin Island Club. Its facility is the only one in the Philippines and one of very few in Asia to offer thalassotherapy, benefiting from its location surrounded by the clean, vital waters of the Pacific Ocean. This Aug. 27 to Aug. 29, Aegle Wellness will again be hosting the Serenity Series in beautiful Balesin. This program is offered to nonmembers of the island. This month will feature Classical Pilates Mat with Linzi Arellano-Co. Linzi has been a Romana’s Pilates certified instructor for 20 years now. She got certified in New York in 2001 under Joseph Pilates’ student, Romana Kryzanowska. She owns Pure Pilates in Quezon City, and teaches workshops both here and abroad. This is her third time in Balesin, and the mat class is an open level class, meaning it is open to beginners as well as advanced movers as she is able to give modifications based on different levels. There will be four Pilates classes that weekend. Each class will have a different focus to keep it challenging and exciting. Pilates is a form of workout that works both strength and stretch with control, all while engaging your powerhouse aka your core. I understand and acknowledge how much your daily life has been upended by this pandemic. The routines that you’ve relied on for comfort and order have had to dramatically change.

Filipino homemaker’s cookbook wins int’l award,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/386739/filipino-homemakers-cookbook-wins-intl-award/,"07:25 PM August 08, 2021","Juana Manahan Yupangco, who wrote ‘Mesa ni Misis,’ which puts a new spin on native vegetables, is the only nonchef winner in the prestigious Gourmand Awards Nutrition advocate and writer Juana Manahan Yupangco’s budget cookbook, “Mesa ni Misis,” seems like David against the Goliaths of pricey books by Michelin-starred chefs. “Mesa ni Misis” is one of the four winners in the Best in the World-Vegetarian category in the prestigious Gourmand Awards. This international tilt is open to publishers with the aim of sifting the best of the food and wine books printed each year. The Top 4 winners in the many Gourmand categories represent entries in different languages. Aside from a Best in the World certificate, the winners can use their Gourmand Award seal to promote their works. The awarding ceremonies are always organized in a gastronomic capital. This year, the gala dinner will be held Nov. 29 at Les Cordeliers Convent in Paris, the site of the meetings for the French Revolution. “Mesa ni Misis: A Guide to Cooking and Enjoying Native Vegetables” was a natural outcome of Yupangco’s lifestyle. There’s the oft-repeated story of how, while breastfeeding her son, she ate Moringa, a booster for mothers’ milk production. Weary of malunggay, she explored other greens such as the medicinal saluyot (jute leaves). This sparked her research on local vegetables and their benefits. She started experimenting by adding malunggay to cookies. In 2017, she and her husband Rick experimented with a plant-based diet for health reasons and reaped the benefits. Eventually, their children, Jaime and Rosanna, followed their parents’ example. To fit the family budget, Yupangco resorted to cooking with native vegetables. Yupangco is proud that her children are disciplined. In prepandemic children’s parties, they brought their own food and avoided the usual fare of hotdogs and barbecue. Word spread about how Yupangco gave a new spin to native vegetable dishes, such that she was invited to collaborate with different restaurants. “You could creatively prepare our vegetables outside of the usual pinakbet (mixed vegetables) and ginisa (saute),” she says. Three years ago, while she was conducting a demo at Discovery Primea, media consultant and columnist Philip Cu-Unjieng saw the potential of a cookbook and consequently sought sponsors to support the project. She wrote the book for ABS-CBN Publishing and undertook photo shoots in January 2020. Despite the delays due to the lockdowns and the shutdown of the ABS-CBN conglomerate, the book was launched in October. In six weeks, the first 3,000 copies were sold out. ABS-CBN entered “Mesa ni Misis” in the Gourmand Awards. (Its other entry, “Simpol” by chef Tatung Sarthou, won in two categories: Easy Recipes at Home and Celebrity Chef-World.) “Mesa ni Misis” takes a mother’s viewpoint on how to serve balanced meals with modest resources. It educates about the nutritional qualities of vegetables and dispenses such pointers as how to soak beans to make them digestible, kitchen flavorings and must-have spices. It covers appetizers, entrées, rice and noodles, desserts and drinks. Anecdotes accompany the recipes. “I wrote a dedication to whoever inspired me to make the dish. I dedicated the kadyos-langka (pigeon peas and jackfruit) stew to our yaya who cooked it when we were growing up,” says Yupangco. When ABS-CBN Publishing informed her that “Mesa ni Misis” was selected with three other European titles, Yupangco was astonished. “It hit me when the winners were announced in May,” she recalls when she heard of the other cookbooks in the Vegetarian category. The cover of “Mesa ni Misis” is fuchsia, with the title, subtitle and blurbs rendered in different fonts. Reluctantly, the dolled-up author posed behind a colorful buffet of vegetarian food. This vibrant albeit busy layout appealed to the local mass market. The 40-recipe paperback costs P250 or $5, while the European books are in the range of $39 to $69. On the other hand, the covers of the European books were rendered in soft color tones, highlighting a single dish. The photo of Swiss chef Tanja Grandijts, author of “Tanja Vegetarisch (Tanya Vegetarian),” photographed in her uniform behind white bowls of lettuce, is set against a mint green hardbound cover. German chef Benjamin Maertz’s “Heimat Weite Welt (Home: Wide World)” features an off-white cover of an hors d’oeuvre atop a bird’s nest, photographed by Lukas Kirchgasser, one of the world’s best food photographers. The cover of French chef/blogger Maud Vatinel’s “La Bretagne Vegetale (Vegetable Brittany)” is a tight shot of grilled vegetables with a creamy dip. The food styling, layout and photography follow exacting European standards in all these books. Named Best Chef 2020 in Switzerland, Grandijts has earned two Michelin stars, and her “Tanja Vegetarisch” earned four book awards. Michelin-starred Maertz is a celebrity in Germany’s gastronomic scene. Vatinel is a freelance chef who caters healthy food and shares eco-friendly tips on her Instagram. “I’m out of my league, I can’t believe I won against these other books,” says Yupangco, the only nonprofessional among the winners. What sets “Mesa ni Misis” apart is its advocacy. While the other books focus on sensory delights and dishes for an affluent society, “Mesa ni Misis” addresses an underserved market. She interviewed parents of public school children to find out if they had kitchen equipment. The recipes take into consideration the family’s limited appliances. “I wouldn’t include broccoli or carrots or use recipes that need a blender. I’d mash the food instead,” she maintains. Fully sponsored yet again, “Mesa ni Misis” is now on its second print run, stamped with the Best in the World Gourmand Book Awards seal. “Mesa ni Misis” is also an nongovernmental organization that promotes healthy alternatives to the oily, starchy and sugary Pinoy diet that results in heart disease and diabetes. Yupangco started the Mesa ni Misis educational program through MovEd Foundation in 2018. She spread the word on a plant-based diet in three Makati public schools. Through Binhi English Literacy Foundation, she conducted programs in a Tondo elementary school. One of her main talking points is the “Plantlasang Pinoy Plate,” a local version of food groups for a balanced vegetarian meal. At the start of the pandemic, she launched two community programs: Kusina Connection served vegan meals to front-liners, at-risk communities and elderly homes. Market ni Misis was a mobile palengke of cheaper goods, done in partnership with Benguet farmers, Taguig Mayor Lino Cayetano and other local governments. Today, Yupangco has been producing short videos on plant-based nutrition, meditation and arts for Makati’s biggest public school in Comembo, Makati. She continues online corporate webinars on native vegetables and nutrition. Committed to her advocacy, Yupangco received a scholarship for a food security online course from the University of Edinburgh. For her graduate thesis, she is proposing a paper on cooking with Filipino vegetables. “Mesa ni Misis” is available online on Shopee and Lazada, and in specialty stores such as Real Food and Vegan Grocer. The Kindle version is offered on Amazon.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
The many benefits of practicing yoga after 50,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/386720/the-many-benefits-of-practicing-yoga-after-50/,"06:42 PM August 08, 2021","Improved spine and leg flexibility, wider range of movement, reduction of hypertension, balance of the endocrine system to calm the hormones are just a few Much has been written about the benefits of the yoga practice for people after 50—improved spine and thigh flexibility, wider range of movement, reduction of hypertension, and balance of the endocrine system to calm the hormones, to name a few. For Cristina Holopainen, cofounder and director of Urban Ashram Yoga (UAY), and its pioneers, Margie Duavit and Christine Yang, practicing yoga at this age is more about celebrating their well-being, natural beauty and individuality. Now on its 10th year, UAY, like most studios, has been conducting online classes. Holopainen notes that Duavit, retailer of Hydration Nation drinking vessels, and Yang, senior vice president of Metrobank, have gently pushed their bodies to the max while growing with the studio. “Each of us have gone through different paths. Yet, it’s inspiring to be among friends who have big responsibilities. Our practice of yoga keeps us together,” says Holopainen, who is now based in New Zealand and occasionally conducts UAY classes via Zoom. Over a video call, the ladies shared their wellness journey.  Walking into the bathroom of a health resort, Duavit stepped on the mat and immediately slipped on the slick floor. In a reflex action, she bent her elbows and pressed her forearms down to help raise her back. That feat cushioned the impact of a potentially serious accident. “I did this backbend. It helped, but I still hit my head, which resulted in a contusion. My MRI results were OK, though. When you’ve been practicing yoga, instinctively, your body knows what to do in situations like these,” says Duavit. When she was in her 40s, she attained strength and control in executing inversions and arm balances. As a subject in an endocrinologist’s study on perimenopause and the effects of exercise, she bested the other participants with her impressive results. The levels of her cortisol, a hormone that regulates the metabolism, immune system and response to stress, were constant. She realized that the regular practice of yoga brought physical, mental and spiritual effects. “Yoga has made me my strongest, fittest and best self,” she says. The benefits have helped her confront the challenges of hormonal changes, quarantine, family demands, and her work and role as a congressional spouse. “Yoga has given me the space to be with myself for an hour. It made me stronger and defined who I am. It has given me calm in my 50s,” she says. Turning 51 in November, Duavit marks this decade as the refinement of her learnings in her 40s. Recently certified as a yoga instructor, she has started to share her insights on the practice. “I want to teach a foundation course—weight distribution, alignment of feet and body. Even if some have been practicing yoga for some time, they need to address some habits.” At 54, banker Yang gets compliments for her toned yoga body. She was a pioneer student of Urban Ashram Yoga’s teacher training course, although she never got to teach. Yet, she’s able to apply the knowledge in her practice. When she visits her chiropractor for a spinal adjustment, she can give details on the anatomy of her bodily aches. “I explain the exact movements that produce a certain pain. Yoga makes you more aware of your posture, your movements and how you are more present in the moment.” Yang studied yoga to help her cope with stress on the job. “I developed this reputation as a dragon boss. After years of yoga practice, I became a different person. People say I’m grace under pressure. You don’t see me frown in a challenging situation,” she says. Yoga became a catalyst for her to stop smoking, take up Buddhism and adopt a plant-based diet with some fish. Last year, she started to work remotely in Subic where she has more access to the outdoors. Yang brought props such as belts and blocks to help her align the muscles and ease into a pose. Except for the heavy sweating from hot flushes, menopause has been relatively easy, thanks to yoga and its effects on the internal organs. “There’s no community here that performs yoga regularly. I’m down to self-practice. It’s become part of my lifestyle, like drinking coffee in the morning,” says Yang. Growing up, Holopainen, 50, had a negative image of herself as being too skinny and unfit. Yoga gave her confidence. “It marked the beginning of my enjoyment and expression of the body,” she says. “Yoga forces you to look at the stuff that you don’t look at. Like I wouldn’t have cared about the skin until I learned that it is the body’s biggest organ. The skin reflects what you are feeling inside.” Aside from boosting her self-esteem, the practice eased her panic attacks. Yoga has been shown to soothe the sympathetic nervous system. “I used to wake up with fear. When something feels wrong or if I have the urge to do something, I go straight to the mat,” says Holopainen. Today, she and her husband, Lasse, run a high-end wellness resort, Maruia Retreat Center, in Murchinson, dubbed the whitewater capital of New Zealand. Holopainen has likewise been giving virtual sessions on sleep management, a problem common among midlifers who produce less melatonin or sleep hormones. “The sleeping schedule begins with how you manage your day. You have to work backward,” she says. “If you sleep at 10 p.m. and it takes two hours to quiet your mind, be in bed by 8 p.m. Finish work and eat by 6:30 p.m. Yoga allows you to keep the space. Start the day with the rhythm of the breath. Yoga takes the kinks out of the body and addresses anxiety attacks. Yoga aligns your habits with your circadian rhythm, which dictates your wakefulness and sleepiness.” Addressing menopause of middle-aged practitioners, Holopainen explains, “I give hip movements to release the energy from the pelvis and body exploration like moving in the poses in a gentle flow. They will pay attention to seamless transitions so that they work harder and breathe longer. This is how to move gracefully.” Eye exercises such as eye rotations and focus switching are also taught to improve the functioning of the eyes and to calm down digitally strained eyes. “Older people tend to look down because they are scared to fall. Through yoga, they look ahead, explore peripheral vision and see where they are in space,” she says. Since the eyes bring the mind into concentration, walking with the eyes is taught. Duavit adds that she has been gaining a lot from this. As people mature, they either lose their distance or peripheral vision or both. “The simple eye movements are strengthening,” she says. “People need to understand that yoga has unseen benefits,” says Yang.

Taming our Delta variant fears,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/386707/taming-our-delta-variant-fears/,"05:51 PM August 08, 2021","Ronnie Principe of Ermita, Manila, wrote that we seem to have a crystal ball where we get our forecasts. Well, definitely no crystal balls, but we derive them with reasonable confidence by simply observing what’s going on in the world and how the global developments on COVID-19 would likely impact us. We really hate it when our grim forecasts come true, and we’re saddened that our health officials don’t consider our recommendations. Occasionally, they do, but after a long period of nonresponse. And by that time, it becomes a reactive response, rather than a proactive one. We sounded the alarm at least a month before the last surge in April and May, and we urged our health officials to start preparing for a much bigger surge. We’ve been proposing a multipronged—rather than a simplistic vaccine-centric—strategy. We wrote about it in March, and it was shot down as baseless and preposterous by experts. Later on, world-renowned virologists—including professor Robert Malone, who invented the mRNA technology being used by the current vaccines—said the same thing, with more convincing scientific explanations. It was quite obvious at the rate the variants were developing that it was just a matter of time before a highly infectious and possibly vaccine-resistant variant would emerge. The Delta variant is just one of more variants to come, with increased infectiousness but with less virulence or deadliness. We don’t believe it’s the last COVID-19 surge we will have to deal with, as OCTA Research tries to assure us. However, it’s fair to assume that forthcoming variants may be more transmissible but less deadly. That’s one of the survival principles of viruses and other pathogens. For them to survive for a long time, they should be more infectious, but they should not kill their hosts. On the other hand, a general principle among humans is “What won’t kill you can only make you stronger once you overcome it.” So, our multipronged proposal is to provide everyone with the optimal level of protection to make sure they can lick the virus—either by preventing infection or treating it early before complications set in. The high-risk have to be treated differently from the low-risk. The side effects to be encountered with treatment should be well known and not significant enough to kill or maim the recipient. The benefit from any treatment should always far outweigh the risks. We reiterate that there should be a different level of protection for the elderly and high-risk sectors with comorbidities. This vulnerable population should be immediately protected with vaccination and immune-system-boosting vitamins and supplements. It’s regrettable that up to now, less than 20 percent of this population has been fully vaccinated. If a few local governments like Pasig can promptly attain a near 100-percent inoculation of their vulnerable population, why can’t other local governments attain it? It’s always sad when provincial or regional politics get in the way of protecting our people. I felt so bad when I texted Mayor Margie Moran-Aguinillo of our small town in Buhi, Camarines Sur, to ask her if high-risk Buhinons have been vaccinated already and she informed me that, despite their repeated pleas, they’re just about to get a meager allocation of 1,700 shots for the entire municipality. They have about 7,500 elderly and high-risk lined up for vaccination. So, they’ll have to determine who are at the highest risk. We don’t know if there will be more vaccines to come in the future. We predicted the Delta variant surge would hit us in August and September, and will likely be felt by late July. We also predicted that all current vaccines will be rendered suboptimally effective after six months, and booster doses will likely be required. These seem to be happening with calendar-like precision. At the time we wrote a three-part series on how we could mitigate the consequences of the Delta variant, the official announcement was that there was no indication of any community transmission of the variant, which seemed to have given everyone a false sense of complacency. We reiterated that it was likely in our midst already, but we were just blissfully unaware because we were not doing enough genomic testing. You can’t blame local executives like Mayor Francisco Domogoso of Manila for expressing displeasure at why vital information on genomic testing is coming a month late. Such data is important to validate decisions, but its unavailability does not preclude the Department of Health (DOH) from making reasonable assumptions on what’s going to happen, and how we need to prepare. We understand that the DOH is trying to prevent panic and confusion among the citizenry, so up to this writing they insist there’s no Delta surge yet, although all the warning indicators are flashing already. The best way to prevent the public from panicking is to give them the impression that the DOH and the government are on top of everything. This was the reason we were urging the DOH to come up with anticipatory “what-if” scenarios when dreaded variants breach our borders. We pushed for proper communication so everyone would be physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually prepared. We appeal to the DOH to reconsider our recommendations on a multipronged approach that could mitigate the tragic consequences of a now imminent Delta surge. We’ve repeatedly written about this (“Mitigating the next big COVID surge,” June 29, July 6 and July 13). We strongly believe there’s still a little window left. With the looming surge, the new cases may still hit more than 30,000 a day, but we can limit hospitalization to a bare minimum. The majority of cases can be handled within the community with early treatment regimens. More importantly, we could aim to reduce deaths to less than 1 percent of those infected with adequate and early treatment, and drug prophylaxis to prevent spread of the infection. The Delta variant is notorious for a “one infection, take all” transmissibility. The entire household gets infected when one catches the virus. Prompt prophylaxis is needed to curb the spread beyond the household into the community, as it did in India and is now doing in Indonesia and Malaysia. If we can minimize hospitalization and deaths, then the Delta variant surge and other forthcoming surges will just come and go. There’s no stopping the Delta variant surge—lockdown or no lockdown. Because of our unpreparedness, a strict enhanced community quarantine lockdown is imperative in hotbed areas like Metro Manila, Cagayan de Oro and Iloilo City. However, a lockdown can just temper and slow down the spread, but the downside is that it will extend or prolong the duration of the surge. Aborting the surge is no longer feasible since we admitted a few serious cases of the Delta variant in the hospital, but mitigating its consequences is still highly doable. Had we done our preparations even just a month earlier, there would have been no need for a lockdown now. But since we didn’t prepare early treatment kits to be distributed to the public, we just have to advise the public what to take to stem the Delta wave. We still believe that a preventive and treatment regimen of immune-system-boosting agents including ivermectin, melatonin, zinc, and vitamins D and C can make a huge difference in mitigating the consequences of the surge. There’s good reason to believe we can make a Delta infection just like any seasonal flu or common cold. The public has to be informed that the majority of cases of the Delta variant, particularly in the vaccinated population, will present as common colds, headache and sore throat; hence, most of them don’t quarantine themselves and unwittingly spread the virus. So, the public has to have a high index of suspicion. We still need to practice standard health protocols, but we don’t have to dread it like a dragon that can swallow us anytime soon. We need to tame our fear of COVID-19 into a more scientifically contextualized perspective. Many don’t realize that dengue fever is actually deadlier, and leptospirosis is much more so. We may get infected with leptospirosis when we wade in floods. Many youngsters don’t only wade, but swim in floods. The mortality rate of leptospirosis is 5 percent, going up to 40 percent in severe cases. That means up to four out of 10 can die from severe leptospirosis. Compare that with one to two who die out of 100 infected with COVID-19. Lest we be misunderstood again, we clarify that COVID-19 is something we should all be concerned about, but it does not deserve all the fear and panic we’re unwittingly feeding the virus to allow it to inflict more serious harm. Beyond the physical injury it has been causing us, it’s ravaging our mental and emotional health, confidence, peace of mind, trust in our leaders, economy and hope that we could all live a normal life again. We, especially our decision-makers, may have to refocus on our center—the very core of our being, where God guides and leads us—but only if we care to listen.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
This Ride Revolution instructor also enjoys doing deadlifts,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/386288/this-ride-revolution-instructor-also-enjoys-doing-deadlifts/,"11:49 PM July 27, 2021","‘Don’t deprive yourself or compare yourself with other people’ Bea Antonio, retail operations and training manager for L’Oreal Philippines and indoor cycling instructor for Ride Revolution, has been balancing both jobs while working from home. “I have been trying to get back into some hobbies that I haven’t had the time to do, like reading and making some art,” she said. “I also recently decided that I want to get certified for scuba diving.” Another thing she makes time for? Working out. Antonio, 29, has always led an active life. “At an early age, I was exposed to all sorts of physical activities—swimming, badminton, kickboxing, dance, etc., and I cannot remember a time when I didn’t have any form of activity on the side.” She admits that her motivations to stay fit have changed over the years. “When I was younger, it was mainly stemming from my insecurities and feeling like I needed to look a certain way. However, as I got older, my main motivation was really to allow myself to have an outlet to destress, imbibe happy hormones and, overall, feel good mentally and physically. I think working constantly on myself gives me a sense of control and it allows me to have time to sort of slow down and be fully with myself, because days can get pretty busy for me.” Having other fitness-loving friends helps, too. “I have always had guidance from other friends in the industry to learn more about fitness and what works for me; they were actually key to keeping me inspired and motivated on working on myself.” My fitness routine: Just a good balance of cardio, weights and rest. For cardio, I do indoor cycling or jumping rope in the garage. Sometimes, I even join my parents for a walk around our village and that definitely still counts for extra movement. Even on days when I teach indoor cycling, I still set aside time to lift some weights. For this, there are different focuses per day (upper body, lower body, etc.) and I try to include core exercises as well to ensure that I am able to do a full body workout. I make sure to give myself a good stretch before and after the workout. I also keep track of my water intake (at least 4 liters per day) and my macros. Favorite workouts: I absolutely enjoy indoor cycling because of the feeling it gives you during class. Not only does it get your heart rate up and make you sweat, but it also gives you a good feeling because of the atmosphere of the class. There’s always introspection. I enjoy doing deadlifts because I like seeing how I can set my mind and body to working on the proper form and on the weight that I will carry. Workout frequency: At least four times a week. Where I work out: Right now, only at home because I have been extra cautious of my exposure outside. I do my spinning in the attic, which was transformed into my bike room, and I jump rope in the garage with whatever space I am able to find, haha! But prepandemic, you could find me in the cycling studio or in the gym close to my house. Fitness essentials: (1) Klean Kanteen tumbler—never without my jug because I try to keep hydrated all throughout the day. (2) Fitbit Watch/Fitbit App—it helps me track sleep score, daily steps, heart rate, and you can even input your water intake. (3) MyFitness Pal App—best buddy in keeping track of macros! (4) Foam roller—great for recovery and relieving muscles. (5) Whey protein—it helps me reach my daily protein intake (my favorite brands are Wheyl and MyProtein). My workout playlist: It depends on my mood for the day. Songs can vary from BTS to Kendrick Lamar, as long as it has a good beat! My diet: High-protein, moderate carbs and fat. In every meal, I try to make sure I have a good portion of protein and a balance of carbs. It’s not hard to do at home especially if you like preparing your own meals, but when I go out, I usually stick to the healthier options. Generally, I immediately choose the option that has more nutritional value for me. But I do still allow myself to enjoy fast food from time to time. What I usually eat in a day: For breakfast, it varies from toast, eggs or cereal, but always with big cup of coffee! I can’t function without coffee—my top options would be a cold brew, a flat white or a soy latte. For lunch and dinner, the choices would usually be chicken or fish and I have it either with rice or potatoes and veggies, but I like playing around with my sauces or dressings (there are so many available low-calorie condiments now so it makes meals more experimental and tasty, haha). I don’t usually snack, but when I do, it’s just a sandwich, fruits or dark chocolate. What’s off-limits: I think the only thing I would consider off-limits is allowing yourself to feel down, may it be about your progress, your routine or being offtrack with your step or food goal. I think self-doubt is the biggest thing that can affect your routine or journey, so that’s something I learned along the way. I used to be so tough on myself that whenever I would feel like I “wasn’t getting anywhere,” I would make myself pay for it. Something I learned is that the journey will have its ups and downs and you just have to ride through it. Plus, it is OK to rest because that’s important, too! I think a lot of people forget to be kind to themselves most of the time, especially when there’s a goal they want to achieve (I know this because I’m the same). But it’s always nice to be reminded of that. The fitness journey gets easier and better when you also feel better doing it. Cheat days: I don’t have cheat days but rather cheat meals, because I don’t usually need the whole day, if that makes sense. I’m very simple when it comes to food so it’s usually a double cheeseburger with fries or a samgyupsal spread complete with all the banchan. I also love ice cream, so that would definitely be included. What keeps me motivated: Just the thought that I’m doing this for my well-being is enough motivation for me, but knowing that I also have the ability to inspire other people to work on themselves is also what keeps me going. I always have the thought that “future me will be grateful for what I do now” and it’s really something that helps push me even on days when I do not want to move at all. How the pandemic affected my fitness routine: At the onset, I struggled to adapt to the situation. But later on, I knew I had to figure something out. I had to start with what I had. So I began with just my jump rope, a yoga mat and some dumbbells. I also did some HIIT workouts and yoga from available online classes. Eventually, I was able to get back to my routine and it got easier again. When the restrictions eased, I also started investing in more gear and bought heavier equipment. However, what I learned is that you can make it work with whatever you have even if it means doing squats with a big gallon of water as your weights! Tips for people who want to get healthier: Find a routine that you enjoy fully and allow yourself to enjoy the whole fitness journey. Don’t deprive yourself or compare yourself with other people. Everyone has their own strength and weakness, so just focus on yours and see what you can do to improve on them. Another thing I learned is that consistency is key. Keep at it even if you slow down; that’s OK as long as you don’t give up. I learned from an instructor before that you cannot just be interested in something and not put in the work, so do what you need to and eventually you’ll be able to attain your goals. Lastly, the fitness journey is a marathon and not a sprint, so don’t rush. Rather, enjoy the whole process. INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Zinc and Carbocisteine: Options for this rainy season,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/386218/zinc-and-carbocisteine-options-for-this-rainy-season/,"02:25 PM July 27, 2021"," Written by Marge C. Enriquez In the monsoon season, drastic change of temperatures and the damp air can spread more bacteria and viruses, thus making us susceptible to colds, dry coughs and coughs with phlegm and even Covid-19. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Joseph Adrian Buensalido said doctors take a complete history, physical exam if needed or order a lab test to determine if the contagion is viral, bacterial or the dreaded Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Researches cite that Covid cases tend to rise when temperatures drop and rainfall increases.  Buensalido likens SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) to a criminal on the loose, causing mayhem to people and even killing patients.  “Like a criminal, this virus is slippery, evading the soldiers who make up our immune system. It tries to change its appearance hoping it would not be recognized, become more contagious and aggressive,” said Buensalido in an exclusive interview with Lifestyle.    Dry cough is one of the symptoms of Covid-19, but of late, the World Health Organization reported that 33.4 percent of Covid patients had phlegm. Anti-viral Resistance Besides being vigilant about the standard health measures, proper nutrition props up the immune system to combat pathogens and helps to prevent persistent inflammation  after an infection. Zinc has been found to have defensive effects by sustaining anti-viral resistance and moderating inflammation. “Zinc is a trace element in our body,” said Buensalido. “The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for zinc is around 10 mg. This amount will generally allow the body to maintain its growth, development and immunity functions. However, when you get sick with a viral upper respiratory tract infection or common cold, it would be best to give a higher dose of zinc (at least 75 mg of elemental zinc) for a shorter time (seven days). Studies have shown that this shortens the infections by almost three days.” For the body to fully absorb this mineral, zinc should be taken at least two  hours apart from taking, fiber-containing foods such as bran, whole-grain breads, cereals  and  phosphorus-rich foods such as milk or poultry. “Similarly, it is better to space out taking copper, iron and phosphorous-containing supplements from zinc intake by at least two hours,” he said. Buensalido has been recommending zinc for upper respiratory tract infections for over 10 years now. “The patients get better and would not need antibiotics.  Moreover, it is very inexpensive and has potential minor side effects when used for a short time. Zinc reduces unnecessary antibacterial use which, in the long run, will decrease antibacterial resistance,” said Buensalido. Nutritional Ammo Since the pandemic, he has likewise been prescribing high-dose zinc for his COVID-19 patients.  “Aside from the indirect evidence that zinc curtails the spell of viral upper respiratory infections, three observational studies show that the risk of dying is reduced by around 32 per cent when adjunct zinc treatment is given to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients,” said Buensalido. He warned that most severe form, Critical Covid-19, can feed on essential elements and nutrients such as vitamin C and zinc.  Hence, it is important to meet the RDA of these nutrients so that when the individual falls ill, its body has enough nutritional ammunition needed by the immune system to fight infection. Although zinc has not been proven to directly prevent COVID-19, the right amount in the body ensures a healthy immune system. 
“The body has the ability to maintain its defenses against multiple microorganisms, including SARS-CoV-2,” he said. However, the lack of dietary variety and balance, especially among low-income communities, has resulted in micronutrient deficiencies. Zinc is one the two serious nutritional problems, next to iron deficiency, that affects the public health. Buensalido cites the 2013 Philippine National Nutrition Survey as saying that  zinc inadequacy rose as much as 53 per cent particularly among the poor and the over 50 age group.  A similar survey conducted in 2015 reported that zinc deficiency in the Philippines was at 30 per cent. Expelling Mucus Meanwhile, the rainy weather can spark off sneezing, nasal congestion and cough with mucous which could be triggered by allergens or molds. “Cough and phlegm production are defense mechanisms that protect us from outside invaders to our respiratory tree (airways), including the lungs.  If dust, gases, or microorganisms get into our airways, our reflex is to cough it right back out.   Then our mucus-producing airway cells start secreting mucus so that these elements get stuck and cannot go further into the lungs.  The  body coughs out the phlegm and the foreign bodies stuck to it to clear the airway,” he explained. Carbocisteine is a mucolytic that softens up the phlegm and enables the patients to expel it. In certain cases where patients are infected with a viral respiratory infection, including Covid, coupled with problems clearing out the mucus, he prescribes a combination of zinc and carbocisteine. Recently, Buensalido was one of three panelists in a webinar, “Kwentong Viral News,” conducted by Solmux Advance. The doctors not only clarified that not all coughs and colds are attributed to Covid-19, but also cited the usage of zinc and carbocisteine in abating them. Cough is a sign of a problem or sickness, said pulmonologist Dr. Earl Sempio. Acute coughs–those that are sudden and extend for three weeks–can be exacerbated with fever, pains and other infections. Internist and pulmonologist Dr. Gwen Agra referred to a study where carbocisteine has an anti-inflammatory effect in coughs with phlegm. It helps to subdue viruses that cause the common cold and flu. The webinar was part of Solmux Advance’s educating the public about coughs and colds with the help of health experts.  Solmux Advance’s brand manager Leevan  Fong said since the surge of Covid, the public raised questions about the virus and how to keep families protected. “This campaign informs how the public can fight the virus, take care of themselves in case they get infected and how they could recover quickly. We also want to make known that the combination of zinc and carbocisteine can strengthen patients’ immunity when they catch a cough.    Being armed with the right information and medicine gives us the right knowledge to go on with our lives,” said Fong.

Fullido made her point in an Instagram post last Thursday, July 22, where she showed a plant whose leaves have already turned yellow. “Walang ‘forever’ sa halaman bow,” Fullido quipped. (There is no forever in plants. Bow.) To further prove her point, she explained what happened to her plant. “Plants, like this Philodendron SP Colombia NOID as they age, will shed their lower leaves, absorbing the nutrients and pushing out new growth — as you can see, there’s a new leaf unfurling,” she said. “If your plant is otherwise healthy and growing, and yellowing is only on the bottom leaves (usually the most mature), this is natural,” she added. “Oldest leaves die off as the plant ages, or perhaps while it adjusts to our indoor environments or seasonal changes.”    Isang post na ibinahagi ni Gretchen Fullido (@gretsfullido)   Fullido noted that “you know you’re experiencing a normal leaf life cycle if there isn’t strange [discoloration] or abnormal patterning of the yellowing (they elegantly fade from green to yellow to brown).” “Fresh growth replacing them is also a healthy and good sign,” she said. Aside from being a self-confessed plantita, Fullido is also known to be an animal lover and environmental advocate. She has pet dogs and promotes the preservation of the ocean and the environment.

When a National Scientist says ‘no’ to reclamation,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/386009/when-a-national-scientist-says-no-to-reclamation/,"08:45 PM July 21, 2021","Dr. Angel Alcala takes an expert’s stand on the proposed Dumaguete coastal project—and it would be foolish not to heed him In the 1990s, I was part of a small crew doing underwater videos on Apo Island in Dauin, some 30 kilometers from Dumaguete City, the capital of Negros Oriental. Here, the fishermen were living good lives because of an ingenious way of managing this renowned fish sanctuary: a small portion was protected as a no-take zone, where fishing was not allowed. Instead of depriving the locals, however, the set-up allowed the protected area to overflow with fish that spread all over the rest of the fishing grounds. “A marine protected area (MPA) conserves fish and improves fisheries in an area at the same time,” says Dr. Angel Chua Alcala. “Any place with an MPA will have increased productivity. Apo Island is about 140 hectares. The protected area is a little more than 10 ha, but the effect is to help the MPA produce some 15-20 tons of fish per year. We call that the spillover effect—and that’s only the adult fish. Living organisms on the reef lay eggs, which are carried by currents to the entire island of Negros, and there the species thrive, grow and support the fishermen of Negros Island.” It was only years later that I learned that it was Alcala—National Scientist, pioneering marine biologist and conservationist, and father of MPAs in the Philippines—who originated the idea, and instituted the concept during his time as environment secretary under President Fidel V. Ramos in 1992-1995. According to this “25-Percent Concept,” if only 25 percent of a community fishing area is left alone for two years, the fish population could grow and fill up the remaining 75 percent. MPAs have since become critical to marine conservation as well as livelihood protection all over the Philippines and even the world. It’s quite the irony, then, that Dumaguete, Alcala’s home city and an important seat of marine studies and conservation in the country, thanks to the Silliman University Marine Laboratory he cofounded in 1974 (actually renamed the Dr. Angel C. Alcala Environment and Marine Science Laboratories in 2009), is seeing its coastal environment under threat. As reported by Inquirer’s Jhesset O. Enano last July 12, a proposed P23-billion, 174-ha reclamation area along Dumaguete’s shoreline is being planned, a partnership between the city government and construction company E.M. Cuerpo Inc. It includes a “mini city” with “shopping malls, condominiums and business establishments.” Many in the city of academics, business people, tourism operators and locals who simply love their beautiful boulevard are up in arms, but it was understandably the statement signed by Silliman University’s experts on marine biology, the environment and other fields—Alcala, university president Dr. Betty McCann, Dr. Ben Malayang III, Dr. Hilconida Calumpong, Dr. Rene Abesamis, Dr. Enrique Oracion, Dr. Janet Estacion and Dr. Robert Guinoo—that has carried significant weight. Based on the qualifications of the people who signed it, the statement has also rendered the latest comment of Dumaguete Mayor Felipe Remollo last July 17—that those who opposed the project were “not properly informed”—false and, well, misinformed. “We oppose building an island in front of Dumaguete,” opens the statement, going on to specify how the project will destroy ecosystems that support small-scale fisheries, and how the scale of the project would require destructive dredging of the seafloor. Most significantly, it notes how four legally established MPAs off the barangays of Bantayan, Lo-oc, Mangnao and Banilad will be negatively impacted, or “may even cease to exist.” “If the project pushes through, Dumaguete City will renege on its commitment to do its part in marine conservation for the province, region and country. It will be a disgraceful act, considering that the MPA movement in the Philippines, known throughout the world for its successes in the past 40 years, has its roots in Dumaguete City at Silliman University.” “Such a project will bury corals, seagrass beds and sediments,” says Alcala in a Zoom interview from his home in Dumaguete. He had just received his second dose of COVID vaccine that morning, and was looking none the worse for wear, still dapper at age 92 in his checkered polo shirt. “I’m sorry, sometimes I have a hard time explaining things,” he apologizes—but everything he said made sense. “These are ecosystems that boost fisheries and, at the same time, improve tourism facilities for people to see. Many fishermen will lose their livelihood, because MPAs actually export fish outside to the fishing areas. We have shown that in our research.” Proponents have claimed that the project, which was reportedly planned without any local consultations or disclosures, will help reduce water pollution, Alcala notes. “But that is not the proper solution. What pollutes water is people on land throwing their waste in their backyards, with no proper control of domestic waste products. There are technologies that can improve the handling of waste materials.” Further, any detrimental effects of the reclamation will not be confined to Dumaguete alone. “The sea has permanent currents flowing from the Tañon Strait and the Bohol Sea, along the coast of Negros, into the Sulu Sea. So what comes out of this project could damage other places, as well, and not just Dumaguete.” Alcala rues the fact that despite the Philippines being an archipelago, some people still act without consideration of the oceans that surround us. “There are groups very dedicated to marine conservation, but others also don’t mind it because they don’t see the importance of MPAs. They do not realize that everything in a marine ecosystem contributes to the productivity of the ocean, and we depend on the ocean. “Our efforts, which began as early as 1975, have resulted in more than 1,600 MPAs in the country, but not all are working, because people forget. When the people who set up an MPA pass away, the people who take over destroy it. It’s a psychological problem, a social problem, a behavioral problem. They forget their commitment to the protection of biodiversity.” Alcala knows whereof he speaks, in every possible way. He was born in Cauayan, Negros Occidental, the son of a milkfish farmer, establishing quite early his connection to the sea. He earned his undergraduate degree in biological studies from Silliman University in 1951 and became a teacher there. Interesting enough, his first field of interest was herpetology, the study of amphibians and reptiles, and he worked with Walter C. Brown, a visiting professor and biologist from Stanford University, until Alcala himself got a Fulbright scholarship for his master’s degree at Stanford, and later, for his doctoral studies. Alcala is actually credited with the identification of at least 50 new reptile and amphibian species, and has two Philippine snakes named after him: Lyncodon alcalai (Alcala’s wolf snake) and Opisthotropis alcalai (mountain keelback). In 1977, he created the first artificial coral reef in the Philippines, in Dumaguete, a technology that remains in use today in many parts of the world. “Nothing can really take the place of real coral, however, because they produce oxygen,” he qualifies. He also worked with another National Scientist, the late Dr. Edgardo Gomez, founder of the University of the Philippines-Marine Science Institute, on Gomez’s own passion: pulling the native Philippine giant clam, Tridacna gigas, from the brink of extinction. In 1992, Alcala received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service, for his “experience in tropical marine resource conservation,” because he is a “world-class authority in ecology and biogeography of amphibians and reptiles, and is behind the invention of artificial coral reefs to be used for fisheries in Southeast Asia.” In 2014, President Benigno Aquino III named Alcala a National Scientist of the Philippines; in 2017, he was declared an Asean Biodiversity Hero. He remains a trustee of Silliman University, and leads the board of advisers of the university’s Angelo King Center for Research and Environmental Management (Suakcrem). After the snakes, a species of nudibranch, a colorful sea slug, was discovered in 2019 in the Verde Island Passage and named after him: Chromodoris alcalai. Alcala smiles when asked how he feels about such honors. “I’m delighted to have worked in both the terrestrial and marine environments, and it’s nice to feel that I have made a contribution. But it’s most important for me to contribute to the welfare of poor fishermen in the country who live off the resources coming from the sea. I’ve had 50 years of working with the sea; these Dumaguete fishermen are my friends, and I still talk to them a lot.” Alcala remembers how he used to scuba-dive “almost every day” when he was younger. “Even those dive tables were not yet in vogue during my time,” he says of the older, manual way of computing for dive time and depth, made obsolete today by dive computers. Still, he reads reports on MPAs around the country, keeps in touch with colleagues from the Philippines and abroad, and even cowrote a paper on plastic particles in the ocean, published just last year. Longevity runs in the family, as Alcala’s mother lived to be 102, but he does keep healthy by exercising, eating fruit and avoiding red meat. “My wife Naomi is also 92, and feels the same way I do. It’s a good thing our son and some grandsons are all MDs, so they prescribe medicine for me if I need it!” Climate change may not have been a big issue in his younger days, but this National Scientist acknowledges that increasing temperatures today are proving lethal to corals, as well as to the rest of the planet. Indeed, climate change is dangerous, Alcala concludes—“but so is reclamation. I hope they will see the light and rescind that proposal. It pains me to know that they are thinking of that. I hope our agencies of government will prohibit such reclamation along all important coastal areas.”  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
So why should we care about sharks?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/385865/so-why-should-we-care-about-sharks/,"05:11 PM July 19, 2021","As Shark Awareness Week ends, ocean advocates remind us that without these apex predators, the food chain will collapse On July 14, environmental groups worldwide marked Shark Awareness Day, in the middle of Shark Awareness Week—yes, in honor of an animal that has long been demonized as a mindless killer, since the days of “Jaws,” when the blockbuster film led to the killing of millions of sharks. (Incidentally, the book’s author, Peter Benchley, realizing the damage he had done, spent the rest of his life advocating for marine conservation and the protection of sharks until his death in 2006. As a spokesperson for the Oceans Program of the American leadership forum, National Council of Environmental Defense Fund, he was quoted as saying, “The shark in an updated ‘Jaws’ could not be the villain; it would have to be written as the victim, for, worldwide, sharks are much more the oppressed than the oppressors.”) So why should we care about these “evil” creatures? “Protecting sharks in the Philippines is in our best interest,” reads the campaign by Save Sharks Network Philippines (SSNP), a coalition of organizations from the country’s scientific, nongovernmental organizations and tourism communities, to pass the Shark, Ray and Chimaera Conservation Act. (See signature campaign here: bataris.org.ph/petitions/revise-senate-bill-905-pass-the-shark-and-ray-protection-act.) “An Act Regulating the Catching, Sale, Purchase, Possession, Transportation, Importation and Exportation of All Sharks, Rays and Chimaeras and any Part Thereof in the Country,” also known as the Philippine Shark Conservation Bill, was first introduced by Sen. Risa Hontiveros on July 4, 2017 (Senate Bill No. 1863), and again by Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on July 9 (House Bill No. 7912), during the 17th Congress of the Philippines in 2017. Now, SSNP is pushing for the bill to be made law during this 18th Congress, and before elections roll around. “Their presence is beneficial to both our economy and ecosystems,” the statement continues. “Fisheries on sharks have been historically practiced in the Philippines, with municipal dominating over commercial fisheries. Shark-based tourism contributes to the local economy, as well, such as in Donsol in Sorsogon and Malapascua Island in Cebu. Tourism supports networks and job opportunities for the locals and businesses. Ecological benefits of sharks include keeping coral reefs and seagrass beds healthy, fish populations robust and nutrient cycling in the seas functioning. Healthy shark populations mean healthy seas.” Unfortunately, sharks remain constantly threatened, victims of marine debris, habitat destruction, irresponsible tourism, and the most meaningless death of all, finning, where their fins are chopped off to make expensive soup, and the animals thrown back into the water to die. It doesn’t help that sharks also have a low reproductive rate compared to other species. There are over 1,000 species of sharks in the world’s oceans, with some 200 found in the Philippines, from the elegant whitetip reef sharks to the big, gentle whale sharks that have put the country on the biodiversity map. Several shark species have been protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and the Convention on Migratory Species, but only 25 species are protected in the Philippines. On July 14, two member organizations of SSNP, Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines (MWWP) and Save Philippine Seas (SPS), in partnership with Philippine Reef and Rainforest Conservation Foundation Inc. (PRRCF), Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (TRNP) and the Department of Tourism (DOT), held “A Virtual Dive with Sharks,” a streaming event that allowed nondivers to see what scuba divers see when underwater in Tubbataha in Sulu Sea and Danjugan Island in Negros Occidental. Streamed on the Facebook pages of MWWP and SPS, the online experience, hosted by Chris Ng, featured Kaila Ledesma Trebol of PRRCF, which takes care of Danjugan; Angelique Songco, protected area superintendent of the TRNP, and Maria Retchie Pagliawan, TRNP research officer; SPS executive director Anna Oposa; and DOT’s Assistant Secretary Rica Bueno, Region 6 officer in charge Christine Mansiñares, and Region 4B representative Faye Reyes. Trebol shared videos of the blacktip shark pups swimming in the shallows of Danjugan, a renowned sanctuary that has long been the venue for marine and wildlife conservation camps for youth as well as adults, until the pandemic put a temporary halt to such visits. Trebol assured that such activities would continue when borders open again: “After all, today’s youth are tomorrow’s conservationists.” Oposa, in a scuba mask, led the virtual tour of Tubbataha, pointing out a number of sharks and rays found in the famed World Heritage Site. Songco, meanwhile, revealed how scientific study in Tubbataha continued despite the absence of tourists, while Pagliawan recounted how a 3-meter tiger shark showed up during their last monitoring trip to the reefs, 150 kilometers from Puerto Princesa City, just two weeks earlier. SSNP is lobbying for the public to help push for the aforementioned bill, which will work for the sustainable management of shark populations, as a total ban would also negatively impact subsistence fishermen. What can you do? Sign this petition and share it on your social media networks. Get involved in shark projects and research (get in touch with MWWP and SPS for leads; check out their Facebook pages). Do not buy any items made of sharks, rays and their byproducts and derivatives—yes, that includes accessories made from exotic skins and shark’s fin soup. Report sightings of sharks and rays in wet markets, shops, or restaurants to SSNP (visit savephilippineseas.org).Most important, educate yourself. More people die from dengue mosquito bites, wars, random shootings and even fallen coconuts than shark attacks. Understand that if these magnificent apex predators disappear, the oceans will collapse—and with that, life on this planet. INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"‘Vacc’ to Boracay: Bike, eat, ‘workation’",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/385566/vacc-to-boracay-bike-eat-workation/,"07:41 PM July 13, 2021","The island was given its much-needed time to regenerate. But paradise is not paradise if there are no people there to enjoy it It’s almost criminal to spend a mere five hours in Boracay, which was what I did last July 7. It was also the most productive five hours I’ve had there without even getting a tan, because by the time I left the island, 500 more tourism workers had received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was made possible by our National Task Force (NTF) for COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., our testing czar and deputy chief implementer Secretary Vince Dizon, and the rest of the NTF team who listened to the Department of Tourism’s call to include tourism front-liners in the vaccination priority list. The first roll-out in Boracay finally happened, with an initial target of inoculating 3,000 workers, of which 2,178 are employed in hotels and resorts, 308 in restaurants, 140 in tourist transport services. The remaining 374 are tourism front-line personnel, including tour guides, boatmen, e-trike drivers, airport and seaport front-liners, and water sports providers. I must say, the Boracay front-liners are also lucky to have the best vaccination site in the country—the beach! The combined efforts of DOT, the NTF, the provincial government of Aklan, LGU-Malay, PCCI-Boracay, Boracay Foundation Inc. and the Compliance Association of Boracay to vaccinate tourism workers in Boracay is just the beginning of the plan to vaccinate all 40,000 residents and workers in the entire town of Malay. To realize this goal, Sec. Vince promises that the supply of vaccines will be uninterrupted. I hope more private sector partners pitch in, like Crimson Resort, which donated 5,000 doses to support the initiative and hasten the process. Health and safety will remain a top concern even as travel restrictions are loosening up, especially as new variants keep emerging. While vaccination is one of the most urgent programs to drive recovery, we have also been continuing the rehabilitation projects and infrastructure improvements initiated prior to the pandemic. Two portions of the Boracay drainage project, spearheaded by the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority, were completed last December, with the whole project expected to be completed this year. The drainage improvement project will not only alleviate the perennial flooding problem on the island, but also improve its water quality and supply, ensuring the long-term environmental sustainability of the island. The DOT is also launching three tourism products in anticipation of the return of tourism to the island. The Boracay Biking Tour, which will showcase the scenic terrain of the island, is a unique way to explore the different areas, from the paved roads with shoreline views to the network of dirt roads inside the island, to the peak of Mt. Luho and down to the more secluded beaches. While I do enjoy biking and I try to hop on one every destination I go, the Boracay Food Crawl is probably more my speed. This food tour highlights the iconic dishes of each establishment, and each night spent in Boracay promises to be a culinary adventure. The third tourism product being promoted is the Boracay Wellness Workation Program, which will lure work-from-homers, digital nomads and other flexitimers to spend a longer time—weeks and even months—on the island where they can strike a balance between work and wellness. Boracay has been through its share of upheavals, and it gladdens my heart that the local businesses which have struggled through two closures, the tourism workers who have lost their livelihoods, and the residents who have feared for their health are finally getting to see the light of day again with the safe reopening of tourism and the rollout of vaccines. Of course, the island was given its much-needed time to regenerate. But paradise is not paradise if there are no people there to enjoy it, to share it, to live it. Even though I spent a short day on the island mostly working, I could not help but be amazed at how beautiful it has become again. I also noticed how it’s beginning to recapture more of that Boracay magic—all because of the people who make it such a special place. And I didn’t leave without getting my favorite mango shake from Jony’s, an establishment that has been around since the 1980s. Despite adapting to the new normal, the various health protocols, and the ever-evolving travel regulations, there are just some things that will never change. The author is the Secretary of Tourism.

"Repurposing, reinventing and realigning my life",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/385584/repurposing-reinventing-and-realigning-my-life/,"07:17 PM July 13, 2021","We have the opportunity to create legacies in everything we do “Earth is the right place for love.” —Robert Frost Our world now is in the midst of an emotional meltdown due to this global pandemic. People are restless, volatile; our tempers about to blow, with no mastery over all the negativity happening around us. We are in control of our own happiness. When we talk about pursuing happiness, as if it’s something “out there” which we can acquire if we look hard enough, the scientific evidence suggests that happiness is less about “having” and more about “doing.” Long-lasting happiness can be achieved by changing how we spend our time and our outlook in life. A more sustainable strategy is to increase the understanding about what it means to be happy, and to discover and enjoy small day-to-day acts and activities that improve our well-being over the longer term. Happiness is contagious. Performing acts of kindness to others can boost positive emotions, and make others feel good, too. Keeping healthy relationships is a central source of well-being as it is a fundamental human need. “Inhale love, exhale gratitude.” My soulful cousin Karla Delgado-Araneta shared her insightful sessions while we were in Bhutan years ago. Feeling grateful is correlated with life satisfaction. The higher the gratitude, the happier you’ll feel. In sync with nature and God’s divine blessings, Karla conducted her special healing sessions with specific intentions. Being in Bhutan elevated the soulful experience to higher spirituality and was more meaningful. I learned about contentment and being mindful. Mindfulness is a specific type of meditation-based practice that pays attention in the present moment with no judgment. Put simply, it’s about being able to tune in to what’s happening in and around us in a conscious and purposeful way. Often when something negative happens, our feelings of regret and disappointment overwhelm us to the extent that we become blind to other opportunities that then appear. Karla taught me to look at any problem as a challenge to overcome. We don’t really know how long our life here on earth would be. With all the happiness with new family additions and some relatives living over 100 years old, I think about the legacy I want to leave behind no matter the number of years alive. Living to be a centenarian, Bienvenido Tantoco Sr., former ambassador to the Vatican and cofounder of high-end retail brand Rustan’s, passed away on July 6. At the age of 100, Ambassador Tantoco left behind a rich legacy in the retail business and a loving, close-knit family comprising six children, 21 grandchildren, 40 great-grandchildren and a great-great-grandchild. He had individual relationships with each of them, too. We all want to be remembered for something, to be known as more than merely ordinary, to be seen as someone who truly made a difference. We all want to leave an imprint on this world and to leave behind something that can make the future a little brighter. As I spend my time now repurposing, reinventing and realigning my life, I have also awakened to the realization that we have the opportunity to create legacies in everything we do. It does not have to be a daunting goal and can just simply be acts of joy and kindness. The best legacy I can give to my children is to be a mother they can be proud of. I would like to be a mother that they see as a role model when it comes to living a principled life based on integrity, compassion, empathy and joy. Their mother is a strong, loving and prayerful woman who always strove to do the right thing in life despite challenges and adversities. As a daughter, sister and aunt, my best legacy is my role as the glue of the family! Being the “Ate” in the family, I find joy in bringing all my siblings and their families together. I have a special relationships with all my nieces and nephews and I am happy that I have been around them since they were children, hence my pride and joy in seeing them grow and develop into truly wonderful individuals. As a friend, my best legacy is my love! In these trying times, my dearest and truest friends have been my rocks, and I hope they know how much I love them! Everything is so uncertain but we are all free to make the most of what life has to offer. My present desire is to travel and marvel at the wonders of the world. The tourism industry has suffered a great deal during the past 16 months. Prior to the pandemic, we enjoyed visiting places near and far since the world had so much to offer, until everything came to a complete stop. With the arrival of the vaccines, things are looking brighter now. One such travel agency affected by the lockdown was Corporate International Travel & Tours Inc. (Citti) They amazingly put together our #GoTyaBalkans2018 trip, which turned out to be quite memorable. As a reboot and to jumpstart the return of travel, Citti has launched their newest product—select expeditions to Antarctica via the luxurious Silversea. And launch they did with their first face-to-face event in the new normal held at the exclusive Manila House Private Club on June 30. Silversea’s unique brand of luxury allows the intrepid traveler to immerse in the destination without sacrificing any of the creature comforts the pampered guests are used to.

MSD’s hope from within underscores importance of early diagnosis in “Tita Hope Talks”,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/385435/msds-hope-from-within-underscores-importance-of-early-diagnosis-in-tita-hope-talks/,"12:11 PM July 09, 2021","With the COVID-19 pandemic placing unprecedented strain on health care systems around the world , so does it strike at the people in need of urgent medical care for other illnesses. Afraid that they may contract the virus outside of their homes, patients with chronic conditions like cancer, hold back on their symptoms and work-ups in order to avoid exposure in emergency rooms and even doctors’ clinics. This concern is what Hope From Within, a multi-stakeholder cancer  advocacy campaign spearheaded by MSD in the Philippines, sought to address in its second episode of its cancer conversation series dubbed as ‘Tita Hope Talks’. Tackling Access to Cancer Diagnosis and Navigation in the COVID-19 Era, the discussion highlights the importance of early diagnosis in cancer care, with or without pandemic. Through this episode, Hope From Within seeks to remind the public to consult their doctor as soon as they spot something unusual and not to put off preliminary screening. Afterall, spotting cancer early increases the chances of survival. Hosted by broadcast journalist and health advocate Niña Corpuz, ‘Tita Hope Talks’ gathers experts and health stakeholders to discuss their perspective and provides their insights on various issues surrounding cancer care. This session’s panel of speakers include Dr. Beverly Ho, Disease Prevention and Control Bureau Director of the Department of Health; Dr. Jorge Ignacio, Cancer Institute Director of the UP-PGH; Dr. Guia Ladrera, Oncology Department Section Head of the Lung Center of the Philippines; Melissa Ongsue-Lee , VP for Sales and Marketing of Hi-Precision Diagnostics; Amiel Herrera, Founder/CEO of Medcheck; and Melissa De Leon, President of breast cancer support group Project Pink. The (added) challenge of battling cancer today The role of cancer screening in early detection and its impact on survival is well documented in breast, cervical, lung, and colorectal cancers. However, for the first time, cancer screening has been globally interrupted. As the number of new COVID-19 cases and related deaths increases, interruptions of cancer screening schedules became inevitable. This presents oncologists with some unprecedented challenges. It is anticipated that the gap in cancer screening will result in delayed diagnoses, an increased proportion of patients presenting with advanced disease, delays in treatment, and eventually, detrimental effects on survival. For instance, the PGH Cancer Institute shared that pre-pandemic, the hospital would cater to an average of 120 patients daily. But in 2020 onwards, an average of 20% of cancer patients have not returned for their regular treatments, and some have already relapsed. Some facilities in other hospitals even had to close down as medical attention was channeled toward COVID-19. Screening: A preventive measure for cancer According to WHO, cancer detected at an early stage gives the best chance of survival. But when management is delayed, patients are more likely to meet greater problems and higher costs of care. One way to be more conscious of one’s health condition is to do regular screening. Compared to early diagnosis, screening is a totally different strategy that checks on illnesses that might be present, even if one is presumed healthy. There are three Rs that need to be assessed when doing cancer screenings — risk factors, recommendations, and rationale.  By constantly being in check of one’s health, the effects of cancer on personal and economical aspects can be reduced. Unfortunately, many patients overlook the cancer screening process due to multiple factors. Some are worried that they might test positive for cancer, others fear the procedure itself, some are unaware of where to go and how to book a screening schedule, and to a huge chunk of patients, they view screenings and check-ups as another financial burden for their families. Leading types of cancer and available screening programs Breast cancer remains to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Currently, the Department of Health offers the Breast Cancer Medicines Access Program (BCMAP) in government hospitals to support indigent cancer patients. The BCMAP aims to promote early breast cancer screening particularly among poor women by providing assured access to medicines as well as psychosocial support. The free medicines access program for cancer is not only meant to provide ready access to cancer medicines but to promote early-screening and cancer awareness among Filipinos emphasizing that detecting, treating and managing cancer in the early stages improves the overall prognosis and survival rates for patients. Another leading cause of death among women is cervical cancer. It stands as the second most common cancer type in Filipino women next to breast cancer. Several methods can be used for screenings such as the VIA (visual inspection using acetic acid) and pap smear. The DOH provides free cervical cancer screening provided every year in 58 DOH Hospitals done during the month of May to screen women ages 30-45 years of age. Meanwhile, lung cancer is the second most common and the number one deadliest cancer among Filipino men and women. In 2020 alone, 19,180 Filipinos have been diagnosed with lung cancer; of these, 17 063 resulted in death. Surprisingly, despite these alarming statistics, there are no screening programs existing for lung cancer. A glimmer of hope of cancer patients While the costs of health care in the country remains to be a top concern for a great number of Filipinos, MSD’s ‘Tita Hope Talks’ sheds light on the continuous progress in providing Filipino patients better access to cancer care.  The signing of the Republic Act No. 11215, otherwise known as the National Integrated Cancer Control Act (NICCA), aims to augment cancer survivorship by strengthening essential programs throughout the whole cancer care scope. The Cancer Law the establishment of the Philippine Cancer Center for patients to have a ground-zero for top-quality cancer treatments. And to help Filipinos with finances, a Cancer Assistance Fund is also in the works to complement the implementation of the Universal Health Care Act. It also expands PhilHealth packages for Filipinos diagnosed with cancer. If implemented right and funded properly, the NICCA will give better support to cancer patients, especially those from the underserved throughout every step of their cancer patient journey – from diagnosis, to getting access to treatment options, and to getting post-cancer care all while ensuring that the entire journey isn’t as physically, emotionally, and financially burdensome as it is typically known to be.

Positive parenting during COVID: Listen and empathize,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/385421/positive-parenting-during-covid-listen-and-empathize/,"09:11 PM July 08, 2021","Recognize and address fear, stress and behavioral changes in your children and talk to them honestly and openly  As families navigate virtual learning, social distancing and isolation throughout the lockdown, feelings of anxiety, stress and uncertainty have been the elephant in the room. “The disruption to education, lack of space in challenged communities, technological literacy, mental well-being and relationships, absence of group work and social contact have impacted our kids. They are deprived of other opportunities for personal growth and development,” said Ma. Cristina Padilla Sendin, human resources consultant and writer, in a recent talk for Brotherhood of Christian Businessmen and Professionals Alabang East Chapter. “There are also breaks in continuity in learning and in health care.” She noted that for teens, being away from their friends and significant others is a big deal. They may have also missed celebrating major life events, like birthdays and graduations. This is why positive parenting is what our children need, especially now. Sendin advises parents to recognize and address fear, stress and behavioral changes in their children, and to talk honestly and openly about COVID-19. Children should have access to healthy food, water, playtime and exercise. They should stay socially connected to family members and friends via phone or video chats. “Ask your child what he wants to do. Listen to them, look at them and give them your full attention. Have fun!” she said. Sendin has more tips on how to manage kids at every age during this time: Keep baby safe through social distancing, limiting your baby’s contact with others and practicing good hygiene. Is social isolation bad for baby? Child development and socialization with peers is usually more of a concern from the preschool years and beyond. Parent bonding is more crucial, so connect. A baby’s parents are the most important people in their lives; they learn most about communication and love from them. Be a good role model in practicing health and safety protocols. Treat others with compassion, especially those who are sick or vulnerable; your kids will learn from you. Help with schoolwork. Read a book or look at pictures. Draw. Dance or sing. Do a chore together (make cleaning or cooking fun). Discuss why social distancing is important. Empathize with their frustrations. Provide stability and support: Adolescence is a difficult stage. They need to connect with their friends. Encourage them to be good role models in practicing health and safety protocols, especially for younger siblings to emulate. For mental wellness, talk and listen to them, acknowledge their difficulties, clarify their doubts, reassure them, generate hope and provide emotional support in resolving issues. Talk about something they like (sports, music, celebrities, friends, favorites). Cook a favorite meal together. Exercise together to their music. Sendin stressed that the keys to a peaceful, happy family life are positive language, active listening and empathy. “How we talk and behave in front of others is a big influence on how they behave, too. Try to talk kindly to everyone. The more we practice modeling peaceful, loving relationships for our kids, the more secure and loved they will feel,” she said. Say, “Please put your clothes away” instead of, “Don’t make a mess.” Mind your delivery—shouting makes everyone stressed and angrier. Get their attention by saying their name in a calm voice. Praise your child when they are behaving well. It will reassure them that you notice and care. “And, get real. Can your child actually do what you are asking them? They can maybe stay quiet for 15 minutes while you’re on a call, but not all day,” she said. She suggested creating a flexible but consistent daily routine with structure and free play; older kids can help plan it. “In handling stress or anger, give yourself a 10-second pause. Breathe in and out slowly five times. Try to respond in a calmer way. Call a truce when you can see arguments building up. Go into another room or outside if you can,” said Sendin. Do things as a family. Let each family member take turns choosing a whole-family activity. Find ways to spend quality time with your partner, too. Aside from self-care, Sendin recommended parents have good social support (someone to tell worries to, a person or group to feel connected and accepted) and happy distractions (a mental vacation from the pandemic or from the challenges of being a parent, doing something you enjoy that recharges you).

"‘When in doubt, hire a pro trainer’",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/385393/when-in-doubt-hire-a-pro-trainer/,"07:43 PM July 08, 2021","Working out while listening to K-pop kept this mom sane as she recovered from COVID-19 It was boredom that began Mel P. Tiglao’s fitness journey. “I had classes that started at 4 p.m. and there wasn’t much to do before that,” she said. “We had a gym at the university, so my friend and I joined. We really had no idea what to do back then.” That started what the 43-year-old store manager calls her on-and-off relationship with the gym. In 2011, she joined Fitness First and focused on learning proper swimming form. “My assigned trainer, Coach Ace, was a swimmer, and the branch in RCBC had an indoor pool. I wanted to keep up with my growing boys who I also enrolled in swimming classes in their school. I also didn’t want to be mistaken as a pregnant woman because of my tummy bulge.” Then she joined group exercise classes, including dance and yoga. “My goals then were purely aesthetic. To look good in clothes that fit me,” she told Lifestyle. She did that for two-and-a-half years. In 2019, she joined another gym. “That’s where I met my current coach, Algreen Carlos or Coach Algie.” Tiglao was still in her training program under Carlos when the pandemic hit. The lockdown put a stop to that. “It was a sleep-eat-sleep-repeat cycle. I didn’t get to work out from March to June 2020. My progress was halted.” But she started again in July. “It was my birthday gift to myself. I was back in training under the new normal, via Zoom video conference with Coach Algie.” They train four times a week. “I started working out with only a yoga mat, a 15-pound kettlebell and an ab roller, and my workout space was inside my living room area. Little by little, I added some essentials to improve my workout routine. I also moved my working space outside, along the hallway, where there is good ventilation.” In February 2021, Tiglao was infected by the coronavirus, thankfully asymptomatic. “I opted for home quarantine since I had the required space for isolation, my own bedroom and bathroom. Having COVID has a stigma even if you don’t have symptoms. That was the stressful part. Having COVID was more of a mental test for me than a physical one. I lost weight due to the stress and anxiety. Questions like, ‘Why me?’ and ‘Aren’t I supposed to be healthy and fit?’ bothered me.” To cope, this persevering mom turned to fitness. “I continued my weight training sessions throughout my 14-day quarantine. It’s what kept me sane. It helped me look forward to the evenings. It was my therapy and my happy hour.” Tiglao has recovered and is continuing her fitness journey. She’s on a three-month cutting-down period. “Coach Algie uses the macrocycle program. It’s a combination of hypertrophy and muscular endurance.” Workout essentials: Rubber mats, yoga mat, water bottle, BCAA supplement drink (BPI Sports Best BCAA Fruit Punch Flavor), white board, white board marker, phone stand, Bluetooth speaker, separate phone for music and whatever gym equipment is required for that session Fitness attire: Sports bra, shorts, top, workout gloves, rubber shoes, head wrap to keep sweat and hair away from my face, face towel and Apple iWatch to track my workout. My diet: When I first started dieting, I overdid it and got dizzy because most calories went to my breakfast or lunch and I got dizzy by dinner. To help me learn how to eat without going over or under the required nutrients, I purchased a week’s worth of prepared calorie counted meals from The Sexy Chef. I only ask for cheat days on occasions like a birthday. My weakness is more of the savory kind of food rather than the sweet. Since I’m cutting, I have to lessen my carbs and increase my protein intake to develop my muscles. I consult an app called MyFitnessPal, a paid app that I purchased where I log in my meals, and it tells me how many servings of nutrients a dish has. It even has nutritional contents of Filipino food like sinigang, adobo or isaw. I synced it to my Apple iWatch so it can add the calories I burned or used during workout. I stick to 1,200 calories/day, 45 percent carbs, 5 percent simple carbs, 35 percent protein, 12 percent to 15 percent or less fat and I drink 2 to 2.5 liters of distilled water. Recommended food for breakfast are oatmeal, egg whites, citrus fruits, peanut butter sandwich; lunch is chicken breast, salmon, brown rice; afternoon snack is eggs, nuts, banana, coffee; dinner is brown rice, chicken breast; and before bedtime, Greek yogurt. What keeps me motivated: No one pushes you harder than your trainer. I have always gotten myself a fitness trainer whenever I wanted to reach a fitness goal. If you want to reach your fitness goals fast, hire a professional fitness trainer. It will lessen the guesswork and idle time searching for what program to do, what equipment to use and you’ll spend less time fiddling with your phone. They will teach you proper form in performing an exercise so you won’t injure yourself. You will also be disciplined to accomplish the program without distractions. Music is also my motivation. I can’t work out without music. My workout playlist: The year 2020 was all about K-pop music and bands. Their music during my workouts helped me cope with the stress of the enhanced community quarantine. While the rest are into BTS, I gravitated toward Big Bang. I enjoyed other groups like Blackpink, Super Junior, Twice, EXO, BTS, Rain, etc. Songs I listen to when I’m doing deadlifts: “Crayon” by G-Dragon, “Gang” by Rain, “Cherry Bomb” by NCT 127, “Dumb Litty” by KARD, “Monster” by EXO, “MMM” by Treasure and “Goblin (Favorite Boys)” by A.C.E. In 2021, I slowly moved away from K-pop and started to listen to more danceable tunes of the ’90s, specifically dance songs made popular by the Universal Motion Dancers, StreetBoys and Maneuvers. Sample songs are “Come Baby Come” by K7, “Here Comes the Hotstepper–Heartical Mix,” “Asi Me Gusta” by Chimo Bayo and “Rump Shaker” by Wreckx-N-Effect. Fitness tips: Drink 2 to 2.5 liters of distilled water a day. Do a workout you will enjoy—Zumba, yoga, martial arts, sports, cycling, swimming, running, walking, etc. The more you spend energy, the more you will have it. When in doubt on how to start, hire a professional fitness trainer.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
What to do to prepare for Delta variant surge,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/385390/what-to-do-to-prepare-for-delta-variant-surge/,"07:06 PM July 08, 2021","The good news is that we can reduce deaths, since the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines have been shown to protect the elderly and vulnerable sectors well (Second of a series) Although local experts and health officials say they’re not aware of any indication of the Delta variant of COVID-19, it does not mean that there’s really no transmission. We can be blissfully unaware of its presence, but unless we’re doing sufficient genomic sequencing surveillance, we can’t be that confident. We appreciate their desire to not alarm the public, but preparing for a serious threat such as a Delta variant surge requires some mindset preparation by various government agencies, local governments and the public. The sooner we prepare to mitigate its impact on the country, the better prepared we will be. If our mental conditioning is that we’ll probably succeed in preventing community transmission, we’ll likely be caught off-guard again, just like during the recent second surge. Our experts also assured us that the new variants—United Kingdom and South African—consisted of only a small fraction of the cases here, and with the vaccination program already initiated, they should not be cause for alarm. Less than two months later, the Department of Health (DOH) reported that the variants of concern were already the dominant strains here and, soon after, we had the big surge that saw hapless COVID patients dying in hospital driveways or parking lots, waiting for a slot in the emergency room. We have to set our minds that the Delta variant is going to be the cause of the next big surge in our country, but with preparation, we can mitigate its consequences and make it come and go, until the next more potent variant, perhaps the Delta Plus, pushes it out of circulation, and so with every new variant that emerges. Unfortunately, adequate preparation rests mainly in the hands of our health officials and policy makers, not of ordinary citizens, although we have our responsibilities to fulfill. If our policy makers stubbornly stick to a vaccine-centric strategy, we’ll likely just end up with a repetitive cycle of surges and periods of stability until the truly big surge of a viral monster with great infectiousness, killing power and stronger capability to evade the vaccines comes along. No worries, that’s still a few mutations away. Hopefully, our DOH and IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases) may finally reconsider shifting from a vaccine-centric approach to a multipronged strategy so we could hedge our bets to win this pandemic war. (See past columns: “Multipronged approach vs vaccine-centric strategy,” April 13; “Six urgent steps that may help turn health crisis around,” March 22; “My rejoinder on vaccination and ivermectin,” March 30.) In a commentary last March, we predicted that our vaccines will likely be no longer effective by September this year. It looks like the Delta Plus variant will be the Achilles’ heel of all currently available vaccines, but we’ll worry about that later this year. Our hands will be full with the Delta variant in the next three to four months. In addition to genomic sequencing of viruses isolated from actual patients, wastewater surveillance for the presence of new variants, particularly in densely populated communities, can also help public health officials detect the extent of COVID-19 infections in communities. This does not have to be done in all barangays, only in selected densely populated ones. Public education is also needed on the changing symptomatology or clinical presentation of the Delta variant, so prompt isolation and early treatment could be done. As I wrote in my Facebook post two weeks ago: “The clinical presentation of the Delta variant is tricky. Fever and cough are no longer the dominant symptoms as in the original wild-type variant. Headache, sore throat, colds or runny nose are now the prominent symptoms. If you have these, think COVID and start treatment, isolate yourself, protect those who have been exposed to you, especially the vulnerable like the elderly and the immunocompromised.” In India, treatment was delayed because many with the atypical symptoms didn’t think it was COVID, especially if there was no fever, cough or loss of smell and taste. Only a minority of cases with the Delta variant still present with the previous classical symptoms. The majority present initially with headache, sore throat and runny nose (colds). In a few days, this can rapidly deteriorate into severe respiratory failure, especially in the elderly. Over the last two months, I have personally treated and am still treating more than 10 COVID cases through Viber, presenting with these symptoms —without fever and cough. I suspect they might already be Delta-variant cases but remain undetected. I suspect there might be hundreds, perhaps a few thousands of these cases already in our country, particularly in the provinces where the current surges are being experienced. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential. The key is to have a high index of suspicion, isolate promptly, contact trace, and protect with chemoprophylaxis the exposed persons in the household or office, particularly the elderly and other vulnerable individuals. The Delta variant is notorious for infecting the entire household. The Delta variant is 60 percent more transmissible than the already highly transmissible UK or South African variants. It requires more hospitalization, and is possibly more deadly if not treated early, as shown by the Indian experience. Hence, their death rates have not significantly gone down because, although the cases have decreased by 85 percent, people in the poor rural areas are still not getting the early treatment they need. We must aim to vaccinate 100 percent of the elderly and vulnerable (around 20 million-22 million Filipinos) with Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. As of last week, less than 15 percent of these vulnerable sectors have been fully vaccinated, and mostly with Sinovac, which does not seem to be effective with the Delta variant, as shown by the Indonesian, Chilean and several other countries’ experiences. The good news is that although we may have a third surge of new cases with the Delta variant, we can reduce deaths even lower than our current death rate of more than 100 per day, since the three vaccines have been shown to protect well the elderly and vulnerable sectors. The daily deaths are mainly coming from these sectors. If I were President Duterte, I’d ask Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. each week during their meeting how many elderly and vulnerable citizens they have vaccinated, not the low-risk sectors which are sometimes now being accommodated in walk-in vaccination sectors due to a low turnout of vaccinees. There should be a massive effort to convince the vulnerable sectors who have a high risk of dying should they get infected with COVID, not the low-risk ones who have a one in 300,000 risk of dying from the disease. Only a small percentage of this vulnerable population has been vaccinated so far. Next week, we’ll discuss why the much-desired “herd immunity” is a comforting aspiration to look forward to but, sadly, it’s no longer attainable with vaccination due to fast-evolving variants, as has been shown by the United Kingdom and Israel experiences now. Instead, we should aim for “herd protection,” which can just as effectively—if not more effectively—bail us out of this pandemic in six months or less.

"Should we risk the lives of 300,000 adolescents to save one?",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/384712/should-we-risk-the-lives-of-300000-adolescents-to-save-one/,"06:57 PM June 23, 2021","Side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines seen in the 12- to 24-year-old age group are myocarditis and pericarditis or swelling of the heart muscles (Second of two parts) With the recent approval of the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the use of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine on adolescents aged 12-15 years old, quite a number of parents were glad that their adolescent and teenage children can now avail of the vaccine, in preparation for the possible resumption of in-person classes by August this year. Since adolescent children are not of legal age and parents have to legally decide for them, it is incumbent upon the parents to diligently study the expected benefits vis-à-vis the potential risks of inoculating their adolescent and teenage children. We discussed last week the importance of looking at the absolute risk reduction (ARR) being offered by the vaccine, rather than the relative risk reduction (RRR), which may sound impressive but misleading. The real or absolute benefit depends on the magnitude of the risk in each age group. Hence, one must find out what is the actual risk in each age category.When the risk of dying from COVID-19 is high, such as in the elderly and those with significant comorbidities, the ARR is expected to be also big; but if the risk is so small as in less than a hundredth of a 1-percent risk, then even if the vaccine manufacturers claim a 90-percent RRR, that doesn’t mean anything in actual benefit. Ninety percent of P100,000 may be considered big and worth risking one’s limb to get; but 90 percent of one centavo is certainly not worth the risk of fracturing one’s leg. We may be exaggerating the point a bit for emphasis, but parents may have to consider that their decision to vaccinate their children may not be a very sound decision to make. Sure, we get rare deaths in the 10- to 19-year-old category, and the parents of these unfortunate casualties may think they should have had their children vaccinated, but if all parents thought that way, more than 300,000 adolescent and teenage children should be vaccinated to save one life. But you exposed hundreds of thousands to the potential serious side effects of the vaccine without any clear benefit to them. Thinking of a worst-case scenario in the next 12 months wherein the cases of COVID-19 infections would double compared to the first 12 months of the pandemic, we calculate the risk of getting infected to be 2 percent or around 2.2 million new infections. That means that even in the worst-case scenario, 98 percent of the population will not get infected, but 100 percent of the population will have to endure the physical, mental, social and economic consequences of lockdowns and other measures aimed at preventing transmission. If you don’t have COVID yet now, your risk of dying in the next 12 months is only 0.03 percent or a risk of three chances in 10,000. The odds are 9,997 in 10,000 that you’ll still be alive in the next 12 months, provided you practice the standard health protocols our health officials advise. So, your chances of survival in the next 12 months is 99.97 percent, certainly not that gloomy, Indian variant and all. Now, zeroing in on the 10- to 19-year-olds whom the FDA has given the go-signal to vaccinate with the Pfizer vaccine, the risk of dying in the next 12 months is 0.0003 percent or three in a million chances, or one in 333,000. This was what we were saying earlier that you have to vaccinate 333,000 10- to 19-year-olds to save one life, but you’re exposing 332,999 to the potentially serious risk of the vaccine such as myocarditis or swelling of the heart muscles, and pericarditis or swelling of the covering of the heart. These two serious complications can lead to heart failure and life-threatening irregular heart rhythm. There are now accumulating reports from Israel and the United States of these side effects of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are more commonly seen in the 12- to 24-year-old age group. It’s probably because the natural immunity of young people is quite strong, so their immune cells try to mount a strong reaction against the vaccine components, which are considered foreign intruders in the body. There’s an emerging hypothesis on the current unexpected vaccine side effects that even the inventor of the mRNA and DNA vaccine technology, professor Robert Malone, admits he and his fellow vaccine scientists miscalculated. They thought it was the SARS-CoV-2 virus that triggers the severe immune system reaction and organ damage. Now, Malone says it’s a fair assumption to make that it’s actually the spike protein of the virus, which is toxic to the body and causes all the deleterious effects. Vaccines program the body to produce these spike proteins, and they’re not only limited to the inoculation site, which is the deltoid muscle of the arm. Autopsy reports of some vaccinated individuals who died indicate that the spike proteins are found in practically all organs of the body. The vaccine manufacturers should not dismiss these as isolated reports and coincidental findings. The various FDAs should obligate them to look into this more seriously and withhold vaccination particularly in young people. Since teenagers and young adults have excellent and reliable immune systems, why do we have to mess with it by vaccinating them? We must have a strong justification to do it, except in the few with known medical conditions that make them immunocompromised. When we first proposed suspending vaccination among 40-year-olds and younger several months ago, we were heavily criticized by the expert groups as unduly confusing the public with baseless and dangerous hypotheses. I told some heads of medical societies that it was mass vaccination that was untenable. A targeted vaccination to protect the vulnerable sectors of the population is the more rational application of a vaccination program. It must be a sniperlike precision strategy, and not an indiscriminate ground-zero-creating explosion of a potent ammunition. A few days ago, the Australian drug regulators revised their recommendation for the AstraZeneca vaccine, advising against the use of the vaccines in nonseniors. They estimated that the risk of potentially serious or fatal blood clot complications with the vaccine is one in 71,430 in those aged 60 and older; one in 37,000 in the 50-59 age group; and one in 32,250 in the younger than 50 age group. In short, the younger the age of the vaccinees, the higher the risk of potentially serious reactions, mainly blood clot complications that may lead to death. Although it was partly intuitive when we made that recommendation several months ago to suspend vaccination among 40-year-olds and younger, the emerging figures from the risk of vaccination appear to support it. It’s not such a wild hypothesis, as it was branded by our esteemed colleagues. We don’t have yet the figures to calculate the risk for myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents, teenagers and young adults. All we know is that they’re the hardest hit. Following an emergency meeting, Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, the deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Immunization Safety Office, reported last week 789 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis after being vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, most commonly after the second dose. Of these, 475 were 30 years old and younger. Majority of the cases are in the 12-24 age group. Shimabukuro was reported as saying: “We’re still learning about the data … As we gather more information, we’ll begin to get a better idea of the postvaccination rates and hopefully be able to get more detailed information by age group.” If the CDC main vaccine expert admits that they’re still in the learning curve on the potentially serious side effects of the vaccine in young people, why should we risk the lives of our children with all the unknown perils that await them in the short-, mid- and long-term? Since no clear benefits can be demonstrated by vaccination in the younger-than-40-year-olds, our FDA should only allow emergency use authorization (EUA) on the elderly and the 40-year-olds and older with comorbidities. The EUA on younger adults, especially in adolescent and teenagers, should be withdrawn. Longer safety studies and full licensure, rather than EUA, should be required for all vaccines before they’re allowed for the younger age categories. We should avoid the pitfall of the treatment being worse than the disease. INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Voice of the people: Cancer survey reveals new insights into public perception of cancer,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/384387/voice-of-the-people-cancer-survey-reveals-new-insights-into-public-perception-of-cancer/,"04:06 PM June 16, 2021","TWO OUT OF FIVE Filipinos have been touched by cancer—either through a personal diagnosis—or by a family member, friend, or colleague diagnosed with the disease, according to a recent cancer survey commissioned by MSD in the Philippines and conducted by  health technology and clinical research firm IQVIA. A cancer diagnosis can be an overwhelming experience and challenges individuals in ways often hard to imagine. Cancer has a profound effect on not only the patient, but also on his or her family. The diagnosis and treatment of cancer results in changes in the patient’s course of life, daily activities, work, relationships, and family roles. It also brings an immense amount of physical, emotional, and financial stress and many challenging situations.  In the Philippines, 189 of every 100,000 Filipinos are afflicted with cancer, while four Filipinos die of cancer every hour or 96 patients every day. Because of the rapidly growing burden of cancer incidence and mortality that affects patients and families, MSD in the Philippines commissioned IQVIA to conduct an online national cancer survey (n=1,000) to measure the Filipinos’ level of understanding on the disease and attitudes toward testing, treatment, and access. General Manager of IQVIA Philippines, Mylene Rodriguez said it is vital to understand the general population’s perception and attitude towards cancer for the healthcare industry to create action plans that would address gaps and unmet needs with the overall aim of increasing incidences of prevention and treatment. “This survey hopes to provide insights around the actual perception of cancer and needs of patients, which the local healthcare system could utilize in designing programs and strategies that would eventually alleviate the burden of this disease among patients and their families.” Key findings on prevalence According to the survey, most of the individuals diagnosed with cancer are females, with breast cancer being the prevailing diagnosis. Higher proportion of breast cancer is reported in NCR, Central Luzon, CALABARZON, Bicol and Visayas and Mindanao. In general, Filipinos’ awareness of cancer indications with highest prevalence and highest mortality aligns with published statistics from the Global Cancer Observatory (Globocan). They believe that breast, lung, colon, leukemia and prostate cancers are most common cancers in the country, while lung, breast, leukemia and colon cancers as top cancers with highest death rates. Other findings include high awareness for leukemia driven by younger respondents (ages 20 – 39 y.o.); high awareness for colon cancer seen in Davao Region; and high awareness for lung cancer seen in ARMM. Citizen satisfaction with government health care services Patient satisfaction is a measure of whether a patient’s expectations about a health encounter were met. In health care, too often it is forgotten that patients are the consumer and their satisfaction with the health care system and treatment is important in their overall experience. Patient satisfaction is an important measure of healthcare quality as it offers information on the health care services’ success at meeting patients’ expectations and is a key determinant of patients’ behavioral intention.  According to the survey, in terms of perception, Filipinos tend to be lukewarm to the cancer treatments available in government institutions. The survey reveals that although more of the respondents are aware of cancer treatment breakthroughs and developments, and that a third of Filipinos are already aware of innovative treatment options. Filipinos’ attitude towards these developments is more tempered as majority are lukewarm in the available treatment options provided by the government. “Our research shows that majority of Filipinos have high expectations on treatment as they believe that its main goal is curative,” Rodriguez noted. Meanwhile, among government agencies providing medical and financial assistance, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) and PhilHealth are the top funding sources known by cancer patients in the country. Other access programs include Department of Health (Breast Cancer Medicines Access Program (BCMAP), PhilHealth (Z Benefit Package),  the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), and Malasakit Centers, which serve as a one-stop shop of financial medical assistance from agencies such as PhilHealth, DSWD and PCSO. However, according to the cancer survey, despite heavy promotion in social media, only a quarter of Filipinos are aware of Malasakit Center. Future of cancer care Access to cancer treatment is a crucial component of one’s cancer patient journey. In the Philippines, the cost of cancer care is a big concern for many patients. This is for different reasons, including the high cost of care, complex health insurance rules, and emotional hurdles in talking about financial issues with others. In a study conducted by the Philippine Institute for Developmental Studies, high levels of out-of-pocket expenditure is seen as regressive as families are forced to skimp on education and other important spending. Catastrophic health expenditure, which is a direct OOP medical costs exceeding 10% of the monthly household income, can be tragic for a family. That is why the signing of the Integrated Cancer Control Act (NICCA) renewed hope of patients, survivors and their families as the NICCA aims to provide via government support a “responsive, equitable, accessible and affordable cancer care through the whole-of-government, and whole-of-system approach.” With this law, innovative treatments are being made more accessible for patients young and old, in the goal of creating better supportive care systems for everyone, regardless of financial capability. The implementation and funding of the NICCA plays a major role in giving cancer patients better cancer care, which includes gaining access to the full cancer registry. If put into practice and given the right funding, the law can help enable long-term sustainable access to innovative treatment options that may provide quality of life and improve overall survival of individuals suffering from cancer. But the journey towards a cancer-free society has just begun, and it is still a long way to go. That is why MSD, through its cancer advocacy Hope From Within supports monitoring public attitudes and trends in cancer management to better assess the progress made toward decreasing the burden of cancer in the Philippines.

Joyce Pring on faith amid problems: God’s promises aren’t dependent on our situation,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/384280/joyce-pring-on-faith-amid-problems-gods-promises-arent-dependent-on-our-situation/,"06:05 PM June 13, 2021","For TV host Joyce Pring, who is in the third trimester of her pregnancy, there is nothing better than to trust God for whatever situation or problem one is in. “This third trimester has been the toughest one yet and for the past few weeks our little family has wrestled with much distress — when it rains, it really POURS,” she said on her Instagram page today, June 13. Pring shared that her family’s current concerns include “health concerns, dog concerns, electricity concerns, and many more,” and have sent her “crying every night out of anxiety and frustration.” But Pring is holding on to her faith and not giving up. “I know that God is teaching me to worship Him amidst the chaos and hardship. That I worship not because of His blessings or our circumstances, but because His nature is good. This is a fundamental truth in my faith… but why is it so hard to learn and hold onto?” she reflected. Still, Pring encourages everyone to cling on to hope as “we are all just works in progress.” “[Sometimes] we cry out to God in desperate times with our pride, fear, hopelessness… even though He has called us into a life of humble, courageous, and hopeful worship and communion with Him,” she said. Pring asked everyone to “remember that His nature, His character, His promises are not dependent on our situation or season, but that they are eternal, unchanging, and unparalleled.” “We worship Him for who He is, we trust with confident faith, and pray for mercy and grace,” she said. Pring and her husband, fellow TV personality Juancho Triviño, got married in February last year. They are awaiting the birth of their first child.

Is weight loss without portion control possible?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/384175/is-weight-loss-without-portion-control-possible/,"06:36 PM June 12, 2021","‘Eat more plants and you’ll need smaller pants,’ says family and lifestyle medicine specialist Dr. Steven Lawenda Since last year’s lockdown, I have been doing grocery and drugstore runs for my immediate and extended family. It never fails to shock me, the staggering cost of maintenance medication for diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, uric acid and cholesterol. These medications can buy time till you get better enough to get off them, but that is hardly ever discussed during a consult. “People are fed by the food industry, which pays no attention to health, and are treated by the health industry, which pays no attention to food,” observed writer, environmental activist and farmer Wendell Berry. In this year’s Truth about Weight Loss summit, Dr. Steven Lawenda noted: “Of those hospitalized with the flu, 93 percent have preexisting conditions: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. Obesity prolongs the shedding of the virus.” Lawenda is a board-certified family medicine and lifestyle medicine physician. After learning about plant-based nutrition in 2013, he turned around his own health and his practice. He was obese (BMI 33) but is now at a normal weight (BMI 23), losing 75 lbs in eight months. He has kept off the excess weight for seven years now. His prediabetes, fatty liver, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and sleep apnea were resolved, and his blood pressure dropped 20 points. He loves his health and food and has increased his joy of living. When he yo-yo dieted, he felt like a failure and was worried he could die suddenly, with his family history of early heart disease (his father died at 45, his grandfather at 38). His father was taking a lot of medication and had a false sense of security (“my insulin will take care of it” while eating pastries). Lawenda extolled the benefits of what he called “The Magical Buffet”: weight loss without portion control, prevention and reversal of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and erectile dysfunction, lowers cholesterol, blood pressure, less GERD, constipation and fatty liver, less need for medication, longevity and a better quality of life (improved mood, less pain and inflammation). “Caloric density is the principle behind the magical buffet,” he explained. “Fiber and water means bulk and weight, feeling full with zero calories. Stretch receptors are located throughout the stomach. When they are triggered by food, they send signals to your brain to tell you to stop eating. With high fiber, whole plant foods, you can eat the most quantity for the least amount of calories.” Lawenda shared success stories of patients who followed his prescription for a whole-food, plant-based diet: Janet, 76, weighed 234 lbs, had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from smoking. Required oxygen (84 percent saturation) and a walker/scooter to get around. After: 150 lbs, oxygen at 94 percent, no more need for walker/scooter, “feels 25 years younger.” Kim, 54, weighed 248 lbs, had gastric sleeve in 2014. Weight lowered to 170 lbs but regained to 189 lbs. Fatigued and sleepy with sciatica and borderline high blood pressure. After: 127 lbs, has lots of energy, no more sciatica after a year, lowered blood pressure. Thought she couldn’t do it, loves it and never going back. Julie weighed 270 lbs. Had a gastric bypass in 2003. Weight went down to 170 lbs, but regained to 245 lbs. After: 160 lbs, with 27 percent drop in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Elizabeth weighed 310 lbs. Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) test was 6.5. LDL was 136. After: 157 lbs. A1C went down to a normal 5. LDL dropped 26 percent to 100. Canceled weight loss surgery. Jerry had angina, chest pain from mowing his lawn and walking across a parking lot; two major heart vessels with significant lesions. Medications had many side effects, diet of chicken and fish and exercise weren’t working. Was told he would need heart bypass surgery. After: In one month, no more chest pain, no need for surgery. Mark, 56, weighed 280 lbs. Had early and aggressive heart disease despite intervention with coronary artery stenting and bypass grafting. At 40, had a heart attack and a stent.. At 50, had angina, coronary artery bypass grafting. At 53, had cardiac arrest playing basketball… Three months later, another cardiac arrest playing basketball… After: 221 lbs. LDL lowered by 26 percent. No longer prediabetic. Now organizes plant-based potlucks at work. Ignacio weighed 134 lbs. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2019 with A1C of 12.4. Started metformin and insulin. After: 118 lbs. No more medication. A1C down to normal 5.1, BP at 125/70. “Studies show that statin users eat worse and gain more weight over time, similar with blood pressure medication users. We underestimate the impacts of illness: physical, psychological, financial, social, family, community. We are too reactive when we can be proactive instead,” said Lawenda. He quoted Ann Wigmore, holistic health practitioner, naturopath and raw food advocate: “The food you eat can either be the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison.” Lawenda contributed his own: “Eat more plants and you’ll need smaller pants! You’ll have less ills and you’ll need less pills!” —CONTRIBUTED INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
My new favorite word is ‘authenticity’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/383769/my-new-favorite-word-is-authenticity/,"06:51 PM June 02, 2021","Being true to yourself is fundamental to living a life of integrity  “Be yourself, everyone else is already taken.”—Oscar Wilde Everything you do in life should start with sincere intentions. Having a clear vision of the kind of person you want to be allows you to pursue a life where your mind, heart and soul are truly aligned. We all have the ability to make decisions that bring us closer to this vision, while making sure to limit our interactions with negative distractions. It is a daily process that, in time, leads us to a healthier sense of self, one fueled by joy and contentment. On the journey to actualizing your vision, one of the most valuable gifts you can give yourself is being fully present in each moment. Take the time to be aware of the deeper, more soulful meanings of why we matter to ourselves, to the ones we love, and to the world. When we recognize our inherent value, we can move with love toward our True North. My new favorite word is “authenticity.” I feel it is the right time in my life to turn the light inward and reflect on what I see in there. After all, we have all discovered new priorities and ideals that define us, since this pandemic forcibly cleared unwanted elements. To be authentic means what you say aligns with what you do. It means that your core values are the same both in your public and in your private life. It means that the life you live is a true reflection of your own values, not the values dictated by external influences. Most importantly, it means having the courage to let go of any relationship or situation that goes against who you truly are. Being able to separate your ego from your true self—to acknowledge and let go of what does not serve us any more—makes one authentic. Learning to be authentic is like learning a new skill. It requires a significant amount of reflection, discipline and self-editing. Perhaps it is easier to understand self-editing in the context of decluttering. Marie Kondo, Japanese author of today’s bible on living an organized life, set off a decluttering craze across the globe as she inspired others to let go of what does not “spark joy.” Kondo says that when tidying up, one must put blinders on and focus only on the category of stuff at hand. As I was cleaning up my room one day, I came across boxes filled with old letters and photographs. Not following Kondo’s advice, I found myself reading one letter after another, suddenly sucked down into a rabbit hole of nostalgia. I see now that, if we are not careful, that derailment can also be present in the pursuit of our authentic selves: when you hyperfocus on the past, you can lose sight of who you are in the present, and subsequently, the future. It is vital to declutter the things in our life that do not spark joy, for it allows us to better appreciate the things that do, and in turn, live life more authentically in the journey toward our true path. The time-tested advice of “be yourself” stands for a reason. It’s probably the best advice you will ever receive. Simple and clichéd, maybe, but as true as ever. Being true to yourself—following your own code of morals and values—is fundamental to living a life of integrity. As high-character individuals, authentic people are deep thinkers who generate power from within and transpose it outward to add value to the lives of others. In thinking inward, we gain more emotional intelligence and act accordingly. Act with good intentions and motives, and you’ll be admired for your authenticity. One thing’s for sure, I stayed authentic to my Assumption College (AC) values that I have lived by since 1981. There is one quote from our school’s foundress, St. Marie-Eugénie of Jesus, that has stayed in my heart and in the hearts of my high school batchmates, even after all these years: “To educate is to transform the world.” Over the years, AC Batch ’81 has launched and supported various community outreach programs, many of them related to educating and empowering the youth. Some of our education projects include support for scholarships and learning aids for the students of the Healing Servants Foundation in Sorsogon; school supplies for public preschools and special education schools in Roxas City; and the building and equipping of three libraries to help the youth in Yolanda-devastated Samar. A couple of years ago, we asked ourselves how we would celebrate our Ruby Jubilee in 2021. We thought that it could be fitting to honor the gift of our Assumption education—40 years after graduating from Assumption High School—by giving back 40 years of Assumption education. So, we established a scholarship program in Assumption School in Passi City, Iloilo, that funded 20 deserving students for their two years of senior high school. Assumption Passi is one of the eight mission schools all over the country partially funded by Assumption alumnae. Two years ago, I flew to Iloilo to start the project with Popsie Gamboa and Maripi Jalandoni. Together with Sr. Jo Concepcion, RA, principal Stella, counselor Jenny and coach Andren, we handpicked the “best and the brightest” in academics and athletics from the public schools in Passi City. Fast-forward to May 26: A big congratulations to our 20 scholars who all graduated from senior high, many of them earning academic and athletic honors. Jethro Ian Perez, our scholar, was one of only three seniors who graduated with high honors (average grade of 94-97!). Ten scholars graduated with honors (average grade of 90-93): Ann Daphne Canlas, Mary Ghel Clarin, Rovic Estaca-an, Nichole Padernal, Mike Brent Palmares, Starwin Panes, Rowela Riano, Ashley Joy Sondia, Christia Marie Villalobos and Adoneram Villanueva. Special awards for Sports Excellence were given to 13 scholars: Luke Emmanuel Andrada, Christian Aquino, Jophelle Arroyo, Adamson Casiple, Rovic Estaca-an, Jett Habiatan, Wendell Joshua Lambuson, Van Fronlan Palmares, Vincent Rafael Palmares, Lee Philip Rolloque, Ashley Joy Sondia, Adoneram Villanueva and Christia Maria Villalobos. Scholars, congratulations again! Now go—take St. Marie-Eugénie’s words to heart, and transform the world! Go forward and live an authentic life today.

COVID shaming and bullying must stop,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/383468/covid-shaming-and-bullying-must-stop/,"06:21 PM May 23, 2021","Recovered victims who feel ostracized should be encouraged to assert themselves, with grounded optimism and without anger Louie (not his real name) lives alone. Throughout the long quarantine, he continued to come by the workplace whenever he could because he felt most productive there and happy to see his colleagues, though of course they all had to observe strict health protocols. His well-to-do siblings, who could afford to ride out the pandemic while comfortably ensconced in their homes, did not approve. In March, Louie sat in a mandatory meeting with a family whose members were all diagnosed with COVID-19 soon after. Louie immediately took a swab test and found that he had been infected. When his older sister Gloria learned that Louie was in quarantine, her instinctive reaction was to dress him down: “That’s because you are always going out. Look at me, I hardly leave my house.” Louie, physically weak and feeling quite helpless by then, pleaded with her to be a little more considerate or, at the very least, stop with the hurtful scolding. A month later, Louie, who had already recovered, received a call from Gloria. She had just tested positive for the virus and, having stayed home for months, could not believe it—plus, the housemaid and the driver did not catch it. Why her? Gloria got a taste of her own medicine from Louie: “See what happens when you’re not nice to people who get COVID?” “Covid shaming” takes many forms, among them blaming the patient, discriminating against medical front-liners and ostracizing victims, including those who have recovered. “Shaming doesn’t work,” says Eleanor Agustin, psychologist at Aegle Wellness Center in Makati (tel. 0917-8219795, 87370077). “The more energy people put into shaming others just to find some sense in a situation that is beyond anyone’s control, the more damaging it can be.” Addressing the psychological needs of COVID patients is as important as treating the symptoms, Agustin underscores. COVID definitely impacts the lives of those afflicted, as well as their relatives’ attitudes toward them. Despite clean bills of health and updated (negative) swab test results, many recovered patients are shunned by their families, officemates, fellow condo residents and close friends who start seeing them as damaged goods. In fact, even if they had adhered to stringent health guidelines before falling ill, they are presumed to have been careless or ignorant, or both. Agustin notes that COVID brought the day of reckoning in numerous relationships. “There are people who stay, but there are others who disappear, after their true colors surface.” On the other hand, she says, the frightening illness seems to have brought just as many families closer, with members reaching out to help the stricken. “Those taken for granted before the pandemic become better appreciated when the sick experience their support.” Agustin helps COVID patients by providing “psychological first aid” for close relations. “I give a short talk meant to widen their outlook. The pandemic has brought incredible and seemingly uncontrollable changes at all levels of patients’ lives.” She cites the importance of respect for both past and present COVID victims. “They go through a lot. They face anxieties, from fear of complications and even death, all the way to social stigma after recovery. Many don’t understand this, much less appreciate it,” Agustin says. She urges the human resources (HR) department in every company to develop a psychological first-aid program that could start with raising awareness of that extensive mental and emotional harm. The psychologist also recommends that former patients be suitably welcomed back at work, saying, “Survivors should be celebrated.” Agustin adds that HR should provide counseling to help the returning heroes conquer all those anxieties, and, why not, maybe even nutritional supplements. Recovered victims who feel ostracized should be encouraged to assert themselves, with grounded optimism and without anger. “Asserting doesn’t necessarily mean being feisty,” Agustin says. “Dialogues and mindful interactions could be very productive here.” She, in fact, views a joust with COVID as an opportunity for self-renewal. “We tend to spend our energy on others. This is the time for the individual to look inside and see: Have I unconsciously allowed people to influence me? What is really important in my life?” British international lecturer, author and life coach Denise Lawrence observes that those who bully COVID survivors are mostly “people who get freaked about what they see in the media (which tend to report the worst possible angles of the pandemic) and project their fears and problems.” She elaborates: “They want to make it seem like they’re doing the right thing, and those who are infected just got it all wrong. Bullies actually have low self-esteem, and so they put on a performance. They compensate by being aggressive.” COVID victims present and past need not feel inferior, Lawrence says. “Prepare your replies to these aggressors in advance,” she suggests. Informed that Filipinos are taught to be nonconfrontational and are therefore usually careful about offending others, she adds, “Then practice to respond calmly but firmly. Just stand up to those who are abusive; they usually back down. You could tell them, ‘Look after yourself and I will look after me.’ Remember, calmly but firmly. That is totally within your purview.” Challenge the “shamers,” she insists. “Give it back to them: ‘There’s no difference between you and me. This is a small thing. How will you survive when the real stuff comes?’ Bullies exist to solidify your courage.” Lawrence explains, “Shaming is not your problem. The problem is their negativity. They are merely demonstrating how selfish and insensitive they are. Remember the golden rule: Treat people as you would like them to treat you. One day, circumstances will turn around and they will be mistreated. Meanwhile, don’t validate anybody else’s judgment of you. Their tactic is to diminish you and make you not OK. They can do this only for as long as you allow them to.” She is a longtime practitioner and teacher of Raja yoga (“highest union with God”) meditation (Brahma Kumaris Quezon City, tel. 89264273; Makati, tel. 88907960). The discipline teaches the individual to experience the kind of happiness that is not dependent on situations or other people. Her parting words for those who feel shamed: “Claim back your dignity. Give yourself permission to be who you are, a being of peace and inner strength, and to experience how valuable you are. Only God is your judge.” —CONTRIBUTED INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
The difference between moving on and moving forward,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/383446/the-difference-between-moving-on-and-moving-forward/,"05:53 PM May 23, 2021","“Around here, however, we don’t look backward for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we’re curious . . . and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.”—Walt Disney To infinity and beyond! We are now at the phase in our lives where we need to truly coexist with all the new circumstances this pandemic has brought us. As the world slowly opens up, there seems to be an expectation that life will go back to normal. However, the pandemic undoubtedly brought about new instances in each of our lives—changes that forced us to adapt, and to adapt with uncertainty. It is baffling to figure out whether we should jump back into our old lives or create a new postpandemic lifestyle. Truthfully, I have not figured it all out yet, and I am still processing all these changes. But one thing is quite certain: I am not the same person I was 15 months ago. I have physically and mentally changed through all these various reiterations of quarantine. The pandemic propelled me into a reflective state that made me question who and what matters most in life. After weeks of soul-searching through meditation, yoga, self-realization, therapy and even Bible study, I had an awakening that showed me the direction my soul wants to follow. According to author Deepak Chopra, awakening happens when you are no longer living in a dream world. In the dream world, we tend to filter everything we experience through our ego; we hyperfocus on the future and the past, instead of the present. Through spiritual awakenings we achieve a clear image of the connection between our individual selves and the universe. In yoga, it is called nirvana or a state of enlightenment. This consciousness happens when you stop being the observer and instead become fully aware of who you are and what you want. Enlightened beings strive to live a good life with a focus on the greater good. We all share different snippets of enlightenment within our lives. Birthday boys Rajo Laurel and Dr. Hayden Kho Jr. constantly post inspiring and insightful quotes to help their Instagram followers develop positive mindsets. Dr. Hayden conducts our Bible study every Thursday and helps me widen and deepen my knowledge of the Word of God. Life does have more meaning when you know your true purpose here on Earth. I have learned that the first step in growth is always developing an acute awareness of the present moment. This allows us to listen to our impulses that tell us what needs to change. There is a critical need to pause and have a purposeful moment of recalibration. In a moment of pause, a single breath can create just enough space for you to notice any toxic tendencies, and to make healthier, more mindful choices going forward. Just before the start of the pandemic, I was busy hosting feng shui talks at gatherings with friends and work colleagues. While I am not a professional feng shui master, I understand enough about geomancy to explain its importance and symbols. I do it for fun and entertainment purposes only! In 2020, the year of the Rat, the strongest message I delivered was that 2020 was a reset year. It was the year to stop old habits and make new ones, correct mistakes, and introduce new values. Little did I know that it was going to be a reset year in every possible and unimaginable way! I remember talking about “crossing the portal”—it was important to consider which parts of your life you were going to reset and let go of, and which parts were going to cross the portal with you into a new life. The pandemic no doubt ensured that we all reset. And as it turns out, it is the universe itself that decides which aspects of life are going to cross the portal with you into a new beginning. So, as I begin to tentatively reopen my life, I find inspiration and strength in telling myself to move forward. Not move on, but forward. To me, there is a big difference. To move on suggests that you turn your back on the past without learning from all its mistakes and disappointments. In moving forward, one embraces all the blissful and challenging memories and lessons of the past—not as burdens or rocks to hold one down, but as totems of a full and well-lived life. We do not allow external circumstances to stop ourselves from the pursuit of our goals. The willingness to continuously keep moving forward is not only important during tough times. It’s just as important in many other aspects of life as well. Moving forward in life helps you to avoid stagnation. It allows you to maintain your pace without being lured by the temptations and distractions. Similarly, the willingness to move on helps you to explore new opportunities and horizons, instead of dwelling on the things holding you back. Moving forward also includes discovering new passions and interests that add to personal growth. I have rekindled my passion for interior design. I am glad to be able to be creative again with design partner Cyndi Fernandez-Beltran. Together with her design team Moss Design House (@mossdesignhouse on Instagram), Cyndi and I are just about to complete the newest branch of Säntis Delicatessen at Robinsons Magnolia. I am also working closely with Kohler, a multifaceted global brand with a diverse portfolio of kitchen and sanitary ware. Kohler also owns golf resorts, whisky and chocolates. I am excited to play golf in the future at one of their championship golf courses. I will soon be promoting the Kohler intelligent toilet.

Virtual + speculative = crypto-art steals the spotlight in Art Fair Philippines 2021,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/382755/virtual-speculative-crypto-art-steals-the-spotlight-in-art-fair-philippines-2021/,"06:00 PM May 10, 2021","The good news is the show goes on, but it risks transforming art from a ‘thing of beauty’ into a financial instrument The good news is that because of the pandemic, Art Fair Philippines (AFP) has gone virtual. After all, the show must go on. The bad news is that it has gone unabashedly speculative, taking the art market further into the speculative market. Art is no longer a “thing of beauty” and “a joy forever,” but a financial instrument. Perhaps to further push the envelope, AFP, which runs virtually until May 15, has not only gone virtual; it has also gone crypto. In focusing its 2021 edition on digital art, it has mounted “Metaverse, the NFT 101 Showcase,” a survey of nonfungible tokens (NFT) along the Ethereum blockchain, a cryptocurrency like bitcoin and dogecoin. NFT is anything digital (not necessarily drawings and visual arts), but it has become lately celebrated because Jack Dorsey, the billionaire owner of Twitter, recently put up his first very Tweet in March 2006 for sale as an NFT. So it’s much like the digital version of memorabilia by the rich and infamous, like the Beatles’ first peruke or a rare photo of Madonna’s very first dirty finger. But it’s made the most impact on the art world where it’s becoming the digital version of fine art collecting. In fact, Christie’s, its nose forever on the scent of something big, only recently auctioned off an image by the American Beeple—a digital collage—for $69 million. While digital art is much like printmaking that is reproducible through copies and reproductions, NFT, as the name more than implies, is nonfungible; it’s supposed to be unique and not replaceable. NFTs are both digital certificates of authenticity and trading instruments. Even if it looks as generic as Beeple’s digital collage that could have been made by any distracted kindergarten student, by virtue of it being called NFT, it becomes not only art, but also currency. Big currency. Like everything else in the capital market, NFT is the product of a marketing roadshow. “Metaverse,” in fact, is “presented by” one of the country’s biggest banks, according to the press announcement, and “cocurated” by AFP, Tropical Futures Institute, “a multidisciplinary think tank and studio” based in Cebu, and Narra Art Gallery, a Filipino digital art gallery. A side exhibit of digital art is “presented” by a telecoms giant. The show has all the makings of a marketer’s gimmickry. “Metaverse” sounds cool but is really illiterate. Obviously the neologism is a portmanteau of “metaphysics” and “universe.” But “verse” simply means “spoken word or phrase,” as in “poetic verses.” Obviously the organizers are using the word because it comes from “universe.” But the Latin etymology is really “universum”—“uni” is one, “versus” is “turned,” and sum, “all things”: “all things are turned into one.” But granted that digital art is a “Metaverse,” creating worlds beyond our own world, it seems quite a contrast for art lovers to be viewing digital works that are in fact commodities, subject to giddy speculative trading and smart moneymaking schemes, and showing fantasy worlds (for digital art conjures mainly utopian or dystopian visions) at a time when the all-too glaring and deadly reality of the COVID-19 pandemic is staring them right in the face. It could be that “Metaverse” may provide Filipinos with visions of other worlds where there’s no novel coronavirus and health and happiness are aplenty, but that’s small comfort for them who, aside from trying to evade the virus stalking them relentlessly, have to catch the community pantry before it closes lest they starve, or have to wait in line forever for the remotest salvation of a vaccine. Thankfully there’s enough art of the authentic kind in AFP 2021, and while they’re up for sale, too, they fulfill the exacting requirements of art, not cozying up to the dictation or speculation of the bourses and markets. León Gallery’s “Elemental: Geometric Abstract Art” features the works of abstract masters Nena Saguil, Fernando Zobel, Lee Aguinaldo, Jose Joya, Florencio Concepcion, Romulo Olazo, Lao Lianben, Norberto Carating and others. Included in the show are the very interesting works of Josef Albers (1888-1976), the German color theorist and art educator, and Carlos Cruz-Diez (1923-2019), the Paris-based Venezuelan artistic innovator. Veteran Crucible Gallery shows its stash of late Arturo Luz abstracts, while Altro Mondo Arte Contemporanea shows a new series of Justin Nuyda’s entrancing “Mindscapes.” Galerie Roberto displays Anton del Castillo’s paintings showing his signature figures in gas masks, but the more interesting pieces may be the stark white resin sculptures of the same iconography but in very intriguing poses. Canvas Gallery has opened up its collection of art illustrations in its children’s publications, especially those that won its Romeo Forbes Children’s Short Story Writing Competition. The works are by no means adolescent or lightweight: They are by Elmer Borlongan, Jehu Bitancor, Dante Lerma. “Each artwork … contains the seeds for countless stories,” the exhibit notes say. “It is up to the viewer to unlock those that are most relevant and genuine.” The same tack may have been taken by Metro Gallery in “Versus,” which sets off works by different artists in its stable (Adrian Evangelista, Pancho Francisco, Dino Gabito, Josue Mangrobang Jr., Omar Whoop Ramos and Crystal Tranquilino), all trying to “throw light on the hidden corners of [the pandemic]—from the confinement of the domestic space to the interior state of the individual, places where some of the most fitful wars are waged.”Ding Gerrous, Esquillo Fun to watch is Paris-based Filipino photographer Ding Gerrous demonstrating the archaic ambrotype process of developing photographs. Since from France came the daguerreotype (the invention by Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre), the first commercially successful photographic process, the demo should be an opportunity for a descent back to the romantic beginnings of photography. Equally romantic is the virtual tour of Alfredo Esquillo’s studio. With his sepia-toned images from the Philippines’ past somehow approximating Gerrous’ vintage photographic process , the tour of his Eskinita Art Farm in Batangas promises to be both a reliving and a recasting of history. Along with Ventura and Borlongan, Esquillo is Philippine contemporary art’s most trenchant artistic voice. And a tour of his atelier in pastoral setting should afford his collectors and admirers a glimpse into his highly fascinating creative process. The German Arndt Art Agency is one of the international art firms exhibiting in AFP 2021, and it provides fairgoers once more with generous glimpses of the exciting Southeast Asian art scene, including the latest works from 2011 Signature Art Prize champion Rodel Tapaya. It’s always a delight to see regional art galleries participating in AFP or ManilART, so the presence of Orange Gallery, however virtual, is an opportunity for Metro Manilans to witness the unique visions of artists far from the center, such as the very engaging Charlie Co. The virtual mode may also be very kind to those who haven’t been to Avellana Art Gallery in Pasay City, which, because it’s an art center off the beaten track, may have dampened the enthusiasm of art lovers. The virtual tour shows how art and setting are fully complementary and even interactive. Avellana is an art installation, art garden and design showcase all rolled into one. Despite the caveat on its focus on NFTs, AFP 2021 should be credited for seeming to restrain the excitement over NFT by mounting with ArtReview the forum, “NFT: A New Revolution or the Emperor’s New Clothes?” The topic is a practice in self-reflexivity (a proper use of “meta” in “Metaverse), although the either-or formulation may trumpet in left-handed fashion NFT as art’s new frontier: Even if the emperor is found to have no clothes, after all, he continues to wear the crown, so NFT still wins. Whether cryptocurrency or crypto-art, is there a difference? Both are driven by speculative, acquisitive instincts. Both are means of cashing in. —CONTRIBUTED INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
I got it from my mama,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/382597/i-got-it-from-my-mama/,"08:59 PM May 08, 2021","People share their favorite fashion and beauty advice, as well as gifts received or inherited, from their mothers Usually, when Mother’s Day comes around, lists upon lists appear. They consist mainly of things to buy, treats to order and pampering services to book for the mothers in our life. This year, Lifestyle takes a different tack and peers at the gifts a mother bestows on her children—both tangible and intangible—and how they helped define who we are today. My mother, Esperanza J. Chee Kee, taught English to high school students for over 30 years. When she finally retired, she had given a total of 40 years of her life to the Ateneo. I learned from her the delight that comes from reading, not as part of schoolwork, but mainly for one’s enjoyment. She would tell me stories of Beowulf, O. Henry’s “Gift of the Magi” and Guy de Maupassant’s “The Necklace.” One particularly creepy story was of a woman who wore and never removed a ribbon around her neck. I was probably eight at the time, and that precise moment when the woman’s husband unties the ribbon that had been keeping his wife’s head attached to her neck the whole time is crystallized in my mind like a hapless fly caught in amber. We asked people what they are thankful for that their mothers taught or gave them. At a young age, I was exposed to my mom’s stylish sense of fashion and interest in interiors. She influenced me a lot, as this is the career path I chose later on. I fondly remember how she knew every family member’s birthday, including those of her great-grandchildren. She made sure to greet everyone on their special day, and would prepare traditional Chinese miswa for good luck. I miss my mom a lot! My mom taught me two things: First, I am not to ever leave my house without earrings because I would look like a boy. Second, my eyebrows always have to be fixed! I remember when I was younger, she would rate any makeup artist by how well they were able to fix my eyebrows. My mom loves all things Filipino. Here is one of my favorite earrings from her, opals in vintage setting by jewelry designer Tita Celia Molano. The most memorable fashion/beauty advice my mom ever gave me is to embrace your body and never fear showing off your assets—meaning, bodycon is beautiful! Whether it’s a tight dress to enhance your curves, short shorts or miniskirts to show off your legs or a plunging neckline, wear it with confidence! To this day, I really credit my mom for the confidence I have to wear whatever I wanted, whatever shape I was in—biggest or healthiest. Nothing feels better than being confident in your own skin and only my mom could have passed that on to me. My mom would always tell me that less is more. Just use an ample amount of moisturizer on your face, a light dab of eye cream and petroleum jelly on eyelids, and you’re good to go.
When buying shoes, dapat daw laging may one inch allowance para pwede gamitin ng mas matagal because I’ll never know if I’ll grow big or gain weight! Also, she told me not to use shampoo every day but just put conditioner so hair is healthier-looking. My mom has always been big on skin care. When we were young, she was also very particular about keeping acne at bay and making us use sunscreen, saying that good skin always makes a great first impression. My mom taught us about self-care at a very early age, because if we can’t take care of ourselves, we can’t take care of others. Happy Mother’s Day, Mom! Best fashion advice from my mom? “Love and keep your things well and they will last forever.” I used to think my mom was too meticulous in taking care of her things. She would spend a lot of time storing and cleaning each item. Now I understand why and I’m becoming like her—archiving, storing and restoring. This Cartier clutch was one of my dad’s first gifts to my mom when they were dating. More than 40 years later, it is in pristine condition. I’m confident it can be passed on to my daughter. The story behind the clutch is priceless. When I was growing up, I remember how Mama was always diligent in making sure that I put on my clothes, socks and shoes neatly. She was very particular about wrinkles on fabric, and how clean the whites were. She would scrutinize my hair—how it looked, how shiny or how messy it was. In fact, she would comb my hair almost every hour during my grade school years. I got used to these habits and they eventually became part of my lifestyle: I always want my clothes crisp and neat, my shoes always shiny and clean, and my hair properly done when I go out. In terms of life’s principles, Mama always reminded me to get up when I’m down, and to never quit the fight of life. These guided me to become a stronger person, and to take every adversity as an opportunity to become a better version of me. Mothers really know best for their children. She taught me that Pond’s Cold Cream is best to remove makeup and to clean my face. In fact, just today (May 3), she sent me Pond’s Cold Cream from Japan because it’s always out of stock in Manila. It’s so lola, but I still use it! My mama always reminds me that life is too short to wear uncomfortable clothes. I take this practical advice to heart. Too-tight tops, shorts and skirts have no space in my closet. As I was growing up, my mama would give me and my sister the best pieces of beauty and fashion advice. One particular advice which I live by and practice until today: to always be clean, neat and tidy. When I was a little girl, I would watch her put on her makeup and get dressed for work. I would always be in awe of how she put everything together, from the time she chose her clothes, accessories, shoes, bags until she put on her fragrance. She always looked so neat and well put together! As she left for work, I would sneak up to her dresser and try on her beauty products! Until now, we share the same love for beauty brands such as Clarins, Chanel, La Prairie, NARS, Laura Mercier and L’Occitane, to name a few. We also love going to spas and salons together and get excited over what nail color and new hairstyle to try! But one of my most favorites were her perfumes! I loved it when the scent lingered on after she left the room, and when she came back home, the scent was still there. This was how my love for fragrance started, and which ultimately led to my personal choices of fragrances. My love for fresh, clean scents stemmed from my mama’s advice to be clean, neat and tidy. She would often buy me after-bath baby colognes, mostly Spanish brands, and this developed my own love for fresh, clean scents. What I love most about scents is that it captures a childhood memory, a story, a place and a special person in my life, like my mama. My favorite objects inherited are pieces of jewelry given to me by my mom. One particular accessory was one designed by my mom herself. My mom likes my hair really, really short. This pandemic, I had more than my usual hair fall so I had to cut it short, actually shorter than I am comfortable with. She loved it! When it grew a bit longer, she kept on reminding me to go back to the salon and have it trimmed. I procrastinated and then another lockdown happened. She never misses an opportunity now to tell me, “I told you so.” I don’t admit it to her, but I do like my hair shorter now. When we travel, we like buying matching tops and have our twinning photos. Since we are mostly at home now, my current favorite items from her are our souvenir shirts and sandos. These are my pandemic uniform and these remind me of our fun travels. My mama’s skin was always more flawless than mine. She would always tell me to wash my face before going to bed and never sleep with my makeup on. Basic but really important. I had this heart stone gold-plated stud earrings and ring, but I lost the ring when I was in high school. I loved them simply because they were from my mom. She’s always a giver to everyone. Thank you, Mama! I love you. She always reminded me to keep it classy. My mom also taught me that good fashion need not be expensive or outrageous. I will never forget how we frequented Hong Kong with the family and shopped in small indie label boutiques for years. She can pick a trendy item and mix it with a more traditional piece and come out chic. To this day, she is as sensible and stylish. There are many little things that I cherished through the years from her. She likes timeless and elegant designs and she fueled my childhood with unique hand-me-downs and most of all, Vogue subscriptions when they were scarce. She saw how I could pore through her magazines and gave them to me. I think that started my life-long love affair with fashion. It was a love for good design that I developed because of her . . . and not just one, tangible object. My mom told me to sleep at least eight hours, power nap and wash my face before going to sleep. But the best advice she gave me is to be kind to others and to love one another. My mom taught me not to focus too much on trends or brands, and to never be too flashy. Because of her influence, I gravitate toward more classic pieces that can stand the test of time and before I buy anything, I always look at the cut, stitching and quality of the fabric. My mom also taught me to never waste money on costume jewelry. If I should spend money, I should always just buy real jewelry, because a pair of diamond earrings can elevate a simple outfit much more than anything fancy ever can. My favorite piece is my diamond earrings, because they came from her. My love for jewelry is heavily influenced by my mom. I grew up seeing her buying these stuff that glitter and I had no idea then how precious those things were. What I treasure most from my mom is the set of heirloom jewelry she left behind because I consider these “storied” pieces. They have so much family history, and a lot of care and love are associated with these pieces. When it comes to style, my mom would always say, be known for wearing a statement piece together with classic and plain pieces. My mom in her little black dress has always been her most iconic style moment. Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen, and don’t go to sleep without washing your face and moisturizing! Mommy Lilian is the most beautiful woman in the world. She taught me that real beauty comes from within. We don’t need expensive beauty products and clothes to look good because when you are truly beautiful from the inside, this will make you glow on the outside. She always tells me that a good-natured smile is still the best makeup you can wear. My mom is always incredibly put together and never steps out in public without dressing to the nines! I think my philosophy of being overdressed rather than underdressed definitely comes from her! I think my most valuable object is a pair of heart-shaped diamond earrings. My dad gave them to her and when I turned 18, she passed them on to me and I take them everywhere I go. My mom says diamonds bring good energy and are lucky, and she always wears them daily and not just for special occasions. I love the sentimentality of jewelry being passed on and I want to pass it to my daughter someday! My mother says to always wear jewelry but stick to diamonds and pearls. Your shoes should always match your bag. My favorite pieces from her are matching diamond studs and watch because they dress up any outfit and make you look polished in an instant. My mom is very low maintenance, and from her I learned that less is more. She was a banker for 35 years and was always practical about beauty and fashion. Years before it was trendy, my mom chopped off her thick, wavy hair and kept her hair very short since the ’80s. She always looked chic and styled her look with statement eyeglasses or earrings. She had a style that was distinctly her own, and was always unapologetically herself. She never swayed with the trends and kept things classic. She doesn’t rely on a ton of products for her skin or hair, but looks great for 70! I guess her minimalist approach to beauty and fashion works. My mom has a pair of South Sea pearl drop earrings that I absolutely love because they’re elegant, classic, timeless. I always borrow them for weddings. They work perfectly for formal occasions, but can also easily dress up a white shirt. Even when I was still young and had a lanky figure, my mom always encouraged me to wear colorful clothes. She said that this would help me look like I have a little weight, and it just became a habit! I am very drawn to colorful clothes and unique cuts. She also pointed out to me that fashion doesn’t have to be expensive, and it’s the way you carry it. Until now, whenever there’s a milestone event, I always ask for her advice on what to wear. No heirlooms, only continuous fashion advice and style. I really got it from my momma. My mom would wear what we now call co-ords—a blouse and skirt with the coordinating prints she would have her tailor make back then. She would never leave the house without makeup (at least powder and lipstick!) and her perfume. Now my fave and go-to look is monochromatic and print on print and I never leave the house without spraying on my favorite perfume, wow brows and lip tint. I got my penchant for jewelry and accessories from my mom. From time to time, I gift her with accessories and jewelry. On her wedding day with my papa in the early ’70s, she wore this beautiful embroidered column dress with white gold and garnet jewelry—the bracelet from that set is one of my most prized possessions. My mom never said it, but she always wore them. So it was her way of telling me, “Don’t be afraid to wear animal prints or prints on print.” A favorite piece of jewelry is a long strand of solid gold beads that was given to her by my father, which she passed on to me. My mom’s fashion advice: “Hoy, ’pag lalabas ka ng bahay para maglaro, mag-brip ka! Her beauty advice: Pwede ba, Mykil, maligo ka araw-araw. Growing up, I watched my mom live a very happy and active lifestyle and eat a balanced diet full of veggies while doing Zumba and, at the same time, doing her church duties as the president of Apostleship of Prayer in our parish, and visiting a lot of places and doing pilgrimages. She is so fit and to this day, people think she’s 10 years younger than her age, 69. My Mama Emma is very minimalist when it comes to make-up, but she has taught us the importance of eating healthy, living stress-free and being beautiful inside and out. She constantly reminds us to sleep early, because cells start to regenerate at 10 p.m., and to wake up early to exercise. She taught me to apply oatmeal with milk and honey to moisturize my very sensitive skin and to condition my hair with aloe vera plant. How she values belongingness, helping those in need, true and lasting relationships and spending quality time with family and friends isn’t just fun, but can help you age gracefully and live longer. She is indeed our light and our strength. My ultimate fave piece from my mom is the Speedy Louis Vuitton handbag that is now vintage, and not just iconic but timeless. I definitely got my love of bags from her. My favorite thing that my mom handed over to me a few years ago was a vintage gold necklace. It’s very sentimental and special because it has a pendant locket containing a black-and-white photo of my papa when he was still a young man. She asked me to treasure it and reminded me to also put a photo of my future husband on the other side of the locket, in time. My mom is now 80, but still moves around the house and learned navigating Facebook and watching dog videos on YouTube. My mom’s fashion advice is that simplicity is the greatest sophistication. My favorite piece of jewelry from her is a diamond ring. It gives me comfort, for I feel she is always with me. My mom’s cowboy vest that she was wearing when she met my dad! Even as a younger woman, my mom was always a fashionista (she was known to wear yellow fishnet stockings in college, and electric orange pants to work), and for her blind date, she chose to wore this brown, hand-stitched cowboy vest with fringes up to the floor. It’s a curious choice to make a first impression in, but I guess it worked on the young doctor in the blue button-down shirt and yellow Hush Puppies who turned out to be my father. Thankfully, she’s sentimental and has carefully kept it all these years, so I have actually been able to wear it. (Sadly, it has not brought me a dashing doctor to marry!) I think the vest beautifully represents her unique, fun, and on-point style, but is also a great reminder of my parents’ lasting and loving relationship. Most of all, I think it shows how my mother treasures memories and people, and does everything to cherish and nurture these. In a time of tired, I’ve-seen-it-all cynicism and stories that last 24 hours, my mother always inspires me to keep and cherish joy, hope, and gratitude in my life. She told me never to mix yellow, rose gold and white gold accessories together. She said to be consistent with the color of the jewelry I am wearing. The price of the accessory doesn’t matter. What’s important is that they look good on you and you feel confident wearing them. You are the one who makes your accessories look good, and not the other way around. As an adult who doesn’t live with my parents anymore, whenever I get to visit them, I always find myself bringing home something from her stack because I like her taste. Fashion/beauty advice: less is more. My mom has a penchant for jewelry and I was lucky to inherit a pair of gold hoop earrings and a ruby ring from her that she gave me on my 18th birthday. It’s one of those timeless pieces that I currently have that matches almost anything, and makes me feel so much closer to my mom whenever I wear it, specially at this time of pandemic. Best fashion advice that I got from my mom is to always wear a good outfit every time you go outside the house, even if you’ll just go to the supermarket or buy some suka and toyo from the sari-sari store. According to her, we need to make a good impression on our kapitbahay. My favorites are a pair of leggings and her old clothes, because when I was growing up gay, my mom was always supportive of what I am. She’d tell me, “Proud ako sa yo anak kahit ano mang mangyari.” Funny, because I have two sisters, and I was always the one wearing her old clothes. I remember when she was still an OFW in Saudi Arabia, she would ask if I wanted a new pair of leggings, because I always used her old pants. When I was little, my mother gave me a necklace with a St. Christopher pendant, for protection. I lost the chain after Mama passed away, but I always kept the pendant in my pocket or wallet so it would be with me anywhere I went. For my birthday three years ago, my then boyfriend (now husband) gifted me with a chain so I could wear the pendant again. I wear it every time I go out or I keep it in my pocket with me. I wear it for its sentimental value. When I moved to Singapore, I asked my mom if I could have her pearl earrings with diamonds. The jewelry just looks elegant and beautiful. I would wear it when I have important presentations in the office. But now that I’m far from family and haven’t been home for more than a year, I wear it whenever I miss her. Her advice: have fun with outfits and don’t be afraid to mix and add color, prints or a loud element in your wardrobe. Even if you have a closet with mostly neutral colors, these bursts of color are good to add to what you’re wearing. Also, to stand out in a sea of people when traveling! Mama’s pearly bag was a gift from my father and the rosary was my grandma’s, handed down to Mama. They are two pieces that remind of my mom every time, her elegant spirit and prayerful heart. The bag has been to a few formal occasions and the rosary goes with me on all my trips. I imagine Mama’s happy up there, knowing I’m taking care of these symbols of love from long ago that she cherished. I can feel all that love still. When my mama says that I’m her daughter, she’s not talking about my fashion sense, language, or anything superficial. Instead, she pertains to our similar mindsets when it comes to organization and work ethic. Besides me wanting to break into the same industry she once worked in, we usually bond over the fact that we like to fuss over to-do lists, clean work spaces, and successfully meeting deadlines on a day-to-day basis. In that sense, I can say that yeah, I really am like my mama!  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Animal meat factories are perfect breeding grounds for virus super strains,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/382535/animal-meat-factories-are-perfect-breeding-grounds-for-virus-super-strains/,"07:10 PM May 06, 2021","‘The next pandemic could more likely arise from animals raised for meat than from wild animals’  Can our food choices impact our body’s resilience against COVID-19? In this year’s Food Revolution Summit, Dr. Michael Greger spoke about how we can we take action now to prevent future pandemics. Author John Robbins continued to host the annual summit that is now on its 10th year. “Before the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2002, only two coronaviruses were known to cause disease in humans, and the impact was only like that of the common cold,” said Robbins. “Ten years later, in 2012, another deadly coronavirus emerged, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Seven years later, in 2019, a third deadly coronavirus appeared, COVID-19 … It seems that people in many rich countries have gotten used to thinking that we have conquered all infectious disease, but our arrogance is more dangerous than we realized.” Greger noted that these coronaviruses all came from animals. “SARS and COVID-19 are traced back to the wild exotic animal trade. The swine flu of 2009 was made in the USA from pig operations. Thankfully, that only killed about half a million people, but the next time we may not be so lucky,” he added wryly. Greger said that COVID-19 is the fire drill to wake us up from our complacency to reform the food system before it’s too late. Factory farms are the perfect breeding grounds for these super strains of viruses. “It’s not worth risking the lives of so many people for the sake of cheaper meat,” said Greger. “Animal factories are flu factories. Animals are the ones who can use a lot more social distancing.” The true cost of cheap chicken is very high. Greger said that the H5N1 virus in 1997 killed 50 percent of its known human victims, but that as devastating as COVID-19 is, it may just be a dress rehearsal waiting in the wings—of chickens. “The Center for Disease Control says that the new avian influenza virus, the H7N9, is a hundred times deadlier than COVID-19, and has killed 40 percent of the people it infects,” said Greger. The good news is there’s something we can do about it. Abolishing the exotic animal trade and live animal markets, and reforming the way we raise domestic animals are a few ways to stop pandemics from forming in the first place. Added Robbins, “It’s easy to point a finger at Chinese wet markets, but global pangolin numbers are in steep decline, and worldwide, a billion pigs are slaughtered annually. The next pandemic could more likely arise from animals raised for meat than from wild animals.” Greger replied, “Before COVID-19, every pandemic that we knew of had been influenza arising from pig or chicken populations. In this new age of emerging diseases, we now have billions of feathered and curly-tailed test tubes of viruses that have incubated and mutated more than billions more spins on the pandemic roulette. So maybe we are one bush-meat meal away from another killer virus. But along with human culpability comes hope.” Greger said that we’ve tried to change people’s behavior based on environmental and ethical arguments, even human health. A certain percentage of the population looked at the science and made that leap to improve their own health, the planet’s health, and to decrease animals’ suffering. But for most, they still eat unhealthily—of course, until something catastrophic happens. “These people don’t have their heart strings tugged the same way. But because the stakes are now so high, we have to accelerate the movement toward plant-based food,” said Greger.He spoke about how big corporations are now getting into the plant-based food space. “Wouldn’t kale or quinoa be healthier? Sure. But when talking about changing how humanity eats, having these stepping-stone foods—healthier options that have sort of the same taste and texture that they’re used to growing up but don’t have the pandemic risk attached—would help. “From a personal health standpoint, they are not the best choices; but from a global health standpoint, they are the revolution that we may need to forestall the next pandemic.” Robbins observed that the Standard American Diet has turbocharged COVID-19. Greger countered that that means we have power over it. All the comorbidities that would make someone fare poorly if they were infected with COVID-19 can be prevented or even reversed by adopting a whole-food plant-based lifestyle, perhaps even quicker than the time it takes to finally get vaccinated. Independent of having diabetes or the other risk factors, being overweight can make you six times more likely to be hooked up to a ventilator or have bad outcomes if you got COVID-19. Greger explained that this is because excess body fat means extra inflammation and fat covering the heart itself. “The change in our circumstances means we have more control over our food environment. We’re no longer passing by the donut shop on our way to work. Holed up in our houses is the time to clean out our pantries, have meditation and exercise time to protect ourselves right now against the pandemic but also in the future against chronic disease,” he said. “It’s never too late to start eating healthy. The healthiest diet is the one that minimizes the eating of meat, eggs, dairy and processed junk, and maximizes the intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, mushrooms, herbs and spices, real food that grows on the ground, from fields, not factories.” —CONTRIBUTED All proceeds from Dr. Michael Greger’s books “How Not to Die, How Not to Diet” and “How to Survive a Pandemic,” DVDs and speaking engagements are donated to charity.

Isabel Oli on conquering hate: I’ve to forgive with or without an apology,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/382072/isabel-oli-on-conquering-hate-ive-to-forgive-with-or-without-an-apology/,"04:03 PM April 25, 2021","Actress Isabel Oli came to reflect on her past hatred for persons who painted a negative picture of her, as she was doing exercises. She recalled the day she was angered by some of these people, as per her Instagram post today, April 25. “So this is me doing some core workout. Usually my gym time is my me-time. I often reflect or dream or think of ways to improve myself physically, mentally and sometimes, spiritually,” she stated. As she was about to finish her workout, Oli “felt the Lord” telling her that she “should be healthy inside and out.” She then recalled the day she was angered after she was accused by some people of doing something which she did not do. “That really bothered and troubled my heart. I was filled with bitterness and anger. Days went by, and I thought I was ok. But every time I remember what happened, a surge of ill-feelings would surface,” she said. Oli felt she was in a “hate-trap.” She realized next that the only way to go about it is to “turn to God’s word.” she said. She then cited three verses which spoke about hate: “1 John 4:20: ‘Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.’; “1 Peter 4:8: ‘Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.’; and — “John 15:12: “My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.”   Isang post na ibinahagi ni 𝐈𝐬𝐚𝐛𝐞𝐥 𝐎𝐥𝐢-𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐬 蘇 心 心🧸 (@isabeloliprats)  Oli knew she needed God to remind her to follow His words. “If not, I would lose sight of His ways, and give in to my flesh. We forget that it is He who gives us the will and the power to act according to His good purpose. You can find this verse in Philippians 2:13,” she explained. “I can choose to disregard the hurt because God has given me the grace to do so. Without Him, forgiving and letting go of the hurt is hard. So I rely on God’s power to help me do the things that He wants me to do,” she said. “So now, by God’s power at work through me, I have to forgive regardless if there is an apology or none.” Oli then shared to her fans that it is more important to “focus on what is good and true and prioritize to save the relationship” because “FORGIVENESS is one way to experience true peace.” JB RELATED STORIES: John Prats, Isabel Oli celebrate 8th anniversary via ‘video call date’ LOOK: John Prats, Isabel Oli welcome baby Freedom to Christian world   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
WATCH: Gretchen Fullido works out in exercise video,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/381980/watch-gretchen-fullido-works-out-in-exercise-video/,"07:48 PM April 22, 2021","For TV anchor Gretchen Fullido, taking a much-needed break from the job and listening to one’s body are two important factors that help us achieve a healthy lifestyle. At the same time, Fullido advises that one needs to exercise, more so if one feels the body is weak, as per her Instagram post today, April 22. She shared a ten-minute exercise video where she is seen doing bending and lifting exercises. “Post dysmenorrhea-migraine comeback/recovery workout. Just a steady [and] chill 10 minutes x 3 rounds para mas fun (so it’s more fun),” she said. Fullido felt she needed a break last week after suffering from “dysmenorrhea + migraine + hyperacidity combo.”   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Gretchen Fullido (@gretsfullido)  “Needed to do bed rest [and] just take it easy… as in chillax [and] just listen to my body. In short, Pahinga (rest),” she said. Fullido thus thinks that there’s “no need [to] force yourself if you’re not feeling well” because “[that’s] just going to be counter productive.” She said this is all the more true when one has pain from hormonal dysmenorrhea and migraine. “Rest if your body [and] mind tells you to. Then just slowly do a comeback when you’re ready,” she said. “Health is indeed wealth – both physically, mentally, emotionally [and] spiritually. But rest is also as important.” Aside from being a health buff, Fullido is also a dog lover and a certified plantita.

"Mikko Tung: ‘In your 30s, fitness is less about aesthetics’",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/381945/mikko-tung-in-your-30s-fitness-is-less-about-aesthetics/,"07:45 PM April 20, 2021","Fitness started merely as a hobby for the Ligo Sardines scion. It has since become his lifestyle Like everyone in the world, Mikko Lawrence Tung has found these past months challenging. “In a way, we have all tried to find some semblance of normalcy again despite the ongoing battle with the pandemic,” said Tung, a scion of the family behind Ligo Sardines. “After a year in lockdown, I have tried to do the same—filling my life with new interests, new hobbies, as well as making it a point to see more of the Philippines with some local travel.” The 37-year-old entrepreneur was recently part of the AXN television show “Project GO,” a reality show where he and his brothers, alongside Maggie Wilson, Bea Cupin and Tina Shieh of GoDaddy, helped mentor young entrepreneurs for a P1-million prize. He’s also been busy with Odd Job Bob. “It’s my property management business. COVID brought on so many challenges for our industry, so these last few months have really been about getting back on our feet with hopes for more growth in 2021.” Another big part of Tung’s life is fitness. “I have been into fitness since my early days in high school—2001 to be exact. Although the reasons for my love of fitness have changed through the years, my passion for it has always remained the same. What started out as a hobby I shared with friends turned into my outlet for all things health and wellness.” Tung’s fitness journey started because of his friends. “They were already into it before I was. These friends educated me on its benefits and why they had all gotten into it. I initially joined them for the love of the barkada, but I quickly saw what it was doing for my overall fitness, and I was instantly hooked.” Tung shares his passion for staying fit on his Instagram account @mikko.tung. There you’ll see him hitting the gym, doing yoga and going for runs. My fitness regimen: My program these days focuses on conditioning my body for the years ahead. At my age, fitness becomes less about aesthetics, and more about strengthening my body to prevent injury and to hopefully slow down the body’s natural physical decline. I try to be as well-rounded as possible to ensure that I’m giving my body the love that it deserves. My program goes like this: Monday: 5-kilometer run Tuesday: Sprint training Wednesday: Weights (deadlifts and core training) Thursday: Weights (arms, legs and abs) Friday: Weights (chest, back and abs) Saturday: Yoga practice Workout frequency: I train every morning for six days a week. I’m also a morning person, and so one of the things I look forward to most every day is working out when I wake up. I really believe that how you start your mornings help set the tone for the rest of your day. Where I work out: I train in Rockwell Atletica. It’s my favorite gym in the city. It’s really near my apartment, and I just love the atmosphere. Something about being surrounded by fitness enthusiasts, I guess. My fitness must-haves: My AirPods, my training gloves, my lifting belt, a really nice pair of Nikes, my protein shake, and these days, my mask. My workout playlist: The ’80s has always been my favorite decade for music, so expect to find artists like Billy Joel, Bon Jovi, Michael Jackson and Kiss on my playlist. I’ve always felt like the ’80s style of music was perfect for working out. My diet: A couple of years ago, I decided to make a lifestyle change. One that was more geared toward health and wellness, and not just fitness. I put myself on a strict diet to not only lose some pounds, but to also start feeling better about myself. I started counting the calories I was eating, and limiting myself to only 1,700 calories per day. I removed alcohol completely, avoided fast food, and I stopped keeping powdered juices and snacks at home. Now that I am in a happier place fitness-wise, I have been less strict about these things. Although I still make it a point to not indulge, I now also never forget to reward myself for my consistency. I love the occasional burger and milkshake from Shake Shack after a week of training. These days, I really don’t limit myself when it comes to food. One of the things that I always tell people to do is to figure out how their bodies respond to the food that they like. I’ll eat whatever is prepared for the day, but still keep a mental note of the calories I’m taking in. What’s off-limits: I also don’t like the feeling of not being allowed to eat certain food. I truly believe that this is the reason people hate to diet. Being deprived of food you love is sad no matter how you look at it, haha! So instead, my advice for people is to just keep a healthy balance. It’s really the only way to properly incorporate a diet into your lifestyle. Cheat days: I do reward myself with cheat days. My wife and I love to spend our Sundays with food, whether it’s ordering in or eating out. So on these cheat days, I allow myself to just completely cut loose and not worry about calories. We all deserve some down time. On my cheat days, I like to keep things fairly simple. I’m a sucker for fast food, and like many Filipinos, the Jolly Spaghetti is a weakness of mine, haha! On some days, I order the chicken and spaghetti meal with an extra order of spaghetti from Jollibee, and on other days, I like to order S&R pizza. It really does depend on what I’m craving for. What keeps me motivated: My motivators for my journey have continuously changed throughout the years. I’ve been inspired by many people, and by many stories over the course of my life, and so my goals have also continued to change. When I started, the sole motivator for this journey was simply aesthetic, but as I’ve gotten older, it has become less about that, and more about health. I think that most people take their 30s for granted, and often don’t realize that these years really do set the tone for our 40s and beyond. So for me, what keeps me motivated these days is simply knowing that I am taking care of my body. How the pandemic affected my fitness routine: When the pandemic hit, I don’t think any of us were prepared for how much things were actually going to change, not just for the fitness industry, but the country as a whole. When the gyms started to close, like everyone I struggled to maintain a fitness groove. But then we all got creative. I started investing in equipment for my apartment. I changed my program to focus more on my cardio and yoga practice, and I even took up jumping rope. At one point, when things really tightened up, I found myself doing sprints in my building’s hallways. (Laughs) I think, if anything, the pandemic taught us that fitness depends less on whether or not a gym or studio is open, and more on how much we actually want to pursue it. Tips for people who want to get healthier: The best advice I can give to those looking into working on their fitness is to simply have a plan. The worst thing you can do to your journey is to show up in a gym and not know what to do. First, understand your body and know what it responds to, and what its limits are. Then, determine what your goals are. This will help in putting together your diet and fitness regimen. Once you have all of these things figured out, the rest will quickly follow. Be patient with your body and focus on falling in love with the process. Those gains will come. INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Black humor and the art of the pandemic,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/381928/black-humor-and-the-art-of-the-pandemic/,"06:53 PM April 19, 2021","Monnar Baldemor’s art of domestic bliss and stress, Mark Martinez’s humorous appropriations, Raul Isidro’s healing abstractions How do artists tackle the pandemic in their works? Rather than tackle directly the gargantuan health crisis, Monnar Baldemor sticks to something closer to home: domestic stress as a result of lockdown. In “Quarantine Sanctuary: Rekindling the Love of Home” (Artologist, Edsa Shangri-La Plaza; tel. 0286963244), she addresses her new works to viewers already harried and harassed by the work-at-home lifestyle imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. She seems to bid them to take a pause from the rat race of their domestic labors (in fact there’s a rat in one painting of a work-at-home woman careerist); she urges them to look around them and smell the flowers. Her cheerfully colored works are a balm to these anxious times, and the viewers are advised to take them all in, like the vaccine doses that the nation direly needs but never seem to the forthcoming. The same playfulness but bordering on dark humor is evinced by Mark Martinez in “Kontak Treysing” at Art Verite Gallery (Shops at Serendra, Taguig), in which the artist applies his excellent pictorial skills and his appropriative style to depict the pandemic in canvases of weather-beaten sepia monotone to devastating humorous effect. Again the milestones of western art are appropriated by Martinez to comment on the health emergency. Vermeer’s “Girl with a Pearl Earring” is recast minus the earring, obscured as it is by a comical face mask; she’s shown holding a bottle of Green Cross rubbing alcohol. A hand in the foreground points a temperature gun at her forehead. Ditto with the “Mona Lisa” with an even more comical face mask and holding a Casino ethyl alcohol bottle. She too gets shot by the temperature pistol: Even iconic universal figures have to subject themselves to humiliating health strictures. Meanwhile, Grant Wood’s “American Gothic” gets a “Philippine Gothic” treatment: the two familiar figures from the American Midwest are transposed to the chaos and squalor of Metro Manila, the father holding a Lysol disinfectant spray while behind them is looming the tawdry façade of Puregold supermarket, as if to say the merry ring of commerce and consumerism continues amid the death knell of the pandemic. But the black humor threatens to trivialize the crisis. One realizes that the art of appropriation, as in Andy Warhol’s banal appropriations, may be nothing but cynicism and a refusal to commit, to empathize. To appropriate art in a time of grave crisis may be another instance of the banality of evil. Perhaps the most striking work here is the recasting of Caravaggio’s “The Incredulity of Saint Thomas,” in which the COVID-19 patient becomes the Christ; the scars of the crucifixion are replaced by the symptoms of the novel coronavirus that are being detected by the doubting Thomases of the medical community. The seriousness of Caravaggio’s original work suits the seriousness of the very dire crisis. And all that Martinez has to do is to recast the old figures into contemporary ones, without cynicism, without the clever tricks of the art trade. Raul Isidro doesn’t directly address the health crisis, but he somehow provides a healing solution to it in his exhibit, “The Natural State of Being,” at Galerie Joaquin Podium (tel. 0926-7227925). The new series continues his explorations of the Philippines’ monumental topographic formations, an art of archaeology if there was one. Again his abstractions seek to mimic and limn the contours and configurations of nature, its rich patterns, and its colorful light and shadows. In his previous exhibits of landscapes and topography, he made references to Greek cosmology, especially that of the pre-Socratic philosopher Empedocles, which sought to identify the material principle in an orderly universe: Is it aqua (water), aer (air), ignis (fire) or terra (earth)? Now he links his Philippine landscapes not only to classic cosmology but also to ontology—nothing less than “The Natural State of Being.” He links nature to nothing less than a universal ecosystem that is nothing less than humanity’s cosmology. Only by maintaining the balance and connection of all this, he seems to say, could one attain healing and well-being. More than pinpointing which is the more principal of the elements, Isidro seems to delight in their interaction. Rather than depict the minerals and elements as inanimate, he shows them living, breathing, with a vitality that throbs in living color. Again and again, Isidro the master abstractionist shows the ever-renewing power of abstraction, spiritual connection and universal communion. —CONTRIBUTED INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Strong friendships can lengthen your life,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/381891/strong-friendships-can-lengthen-your-life/,"05:32 PM April 18, 2021","Call a friend! Now more than ever, friendships are essential in preventing isolation, depression, irritability and loneliness. This long-lasting pandemic has heightened the feelings of anxiety and hopelessness that can wreak havoc on our mental state. These feelings, left unchecked, inevitably shake up our relationships. In the face of all this chaos, it is important to maintain healthy habits—and friends can be wonderful reminders to keep us on the path of self-care and wellness. This may be one reason strong friendships can lengthen your life, because we look after and care for one another. Personally, through this pandemic, I have kept in touch with my running buddies, Girls Run for Breakfast. Before this new surge hit, we had some short, socially distanced runs with face masks, and much-needed catch-up sessions over yummy outdoor breakfasts. Aside from running, I also made sure to practice yoga and meditation often, for both my mental and physical health. While studios were not open, I was grateful to have online sessions with Bikram Yoga Manila studio owner and instructor, and my longtime friend, Ollay Aninion. Despite the ease and privacy of home practice, there is nothing quite like being in a room with other dedicated yogis. I was overjoyed when Bikram Yoga Manila finally opened its doors a few weeks ago and allowed a limited number of participants in studio. Due to the recent lockdown, I have returned to only participating online. Ollay will teach physical classes on Balesin Island for the Aegle Wellness Center (email [email protected]) Serenity Series, which has been moved to the weekend of May 14 to May 16. When stressors build up and cause significant distress in our lives, it is important to have friends who know how to listen, help brainstorm solutions and, above all, provide a shoulder for us to lean on. Being in lockdown away from my running buddies, mahjong mates and other friends I usually see often, I have reestablished new, closer relationships with my kids. My kids are my friends now, and they never fail to surprise me with their unique takes on the world. It is good to seek out different perspectives from our own; in wanting to have more divine guidance in my present challenges, I have turned to an online bible study group. My fave couple and Red Charity Gala sponsors Dr. Vicki Belo-Kho and Dr. Hayden Kho invited me long ago to join their insightful bible study group every Thursday. I have also added another bible study session on Wednesdays with a couple of my Assumption HS ’81 classmates. After one session, Dr. Vicki Belo told me that Belo Medical Group (BMG) confirmed ordering doses of the Moderna vaccine to be given to all employees of BMG and Belo Essentials for free. BMG is targeting to distribute the vaccine by June, after all the necessary approvals and permits are in place to ensure the safety of the people. This initiative is made possible through a tripartite supply agreement between the government, International Container Terminal Services Inc. and BMG. BMG stays true to its “people before profit” principle. In fact, when the pandemic first hit Manila in March 2020, the company took the initiative to temporarily close down their clinics for the safety of their patients and employees way before the government announced a country-wide lockdown. The pandemic has forced us to adjust many different aspects of our lives, but it has also shown us the true nature of our relationships. Your loved ones are there to help you with your problems, whether emotional, physical, or technological! My close friends Vina Francisco and Jojo Ongsiako taught me how to shop online so that I can feed my need for retail therapy. With store operations at a halt, anyone can shop safely through Trunc, SSI Group’s multilabel e-commerce site with over 100 of the world’s most-coveted brands. Customers could shop hassle-free online. With safety essentials as its top priority, Trunc unites fashion, function and practicality with its top “new normal” must-haves like face masks. The reusable, washable, virus-killing Sports Face Mask by Fine Guard is the choice for athletes and fitness enthusiasts. Endorsed by Olympians and Medical Wellness Association, this ultrabreathable model is protected by Livinguard technology that kills 99.99 percent of viruses on contact. Another option is Fine Guard’s N95 Mask, which was specially designed for prevention from flu and influenza. To maintain comfort, it is enhanced with a valve for smoother breathing and it is made from comfortable, soft material suitable for all-day usage. The mask is reusable for a year and can be washed up to 30 times. For a more casual option, Kenneth Cole’s face mask has a multilayer filtration system with an antimicrobial finish on interior and exterior surfaces. Neck Gaitor by Kenneth Cole protects the neck and face from dust and pollution. Trunc also carries Pili Ani’s Clean & Green Alco-Sanitizer, a must to bring around or keep at home. It is formulated with 70 percent ethyl alcohol, Elemi Hydrosol and elemi oil, which has antibacterial properties that help in cleansing the skin. The online shop also carries China Blue Hand Wash by Marks & Spencer, which makes our sanitation rituals more relaxing as it evokes the scent of clean, fresh linen. Shop responsibly. Shop online. Shop safely with Trunc. SSI Group is the Philippines’ largest specialty retailer. They lead the country’s specialty retail market, with 94 brands and 593 stores. This is a good year to take life one day at a time. It is vital to be patient with ourselves as we navigate this pandemic and all of its complications. We all need more self-compassion; even if we may not accomplish our goals in the time frames we had envisioned, we should still celebrate our incremental progress and small accomplishments.

I got jabbed with Sinovac—and lived,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/381528/i-got-jabbed-with-sinovac-and-lived/,"12:04 PM April 11, 2021","The fact is, your fate may be entirely dependent on the efficiency of your LGU or barangay Congratulations!” “Happy for you!” Good job!” With those reactions to my Facebook post, you would have thought I had won the lottery. All that happened, really, was that I followed the advice of doctors that “the best vaccine is the one that’s in your arm.” Given the opportunity, and despite the fact that I had placed an order via a private company for Moderna shots, supposedly due in a couple of months, I decided to look beyond brands and political implications, and got my first jab courtesy of my local government unit (LGU), the City of Marikina. Let me get this off my chest from the get-go: You are entitled to your opinion, of course, if you believe that the Sinovac vaccine is sinister, dangerous, of poor quality, or only for Dutertards. I am fully aware of and apprehensive about what’s happening in the Philippine seas, thank you, but I also don’t think the vaccine is poison—but that’s me. People must choose based on what they believe. My eyebrow shoots up, however, when I hear people say “I don’t buy Chinese things, eeeww” (while cluelessly texting away on a made-in-China cell phone), so they’d rather stay vulnerable than take Sinovac. Or, as I heard from a friend, what about people actually faking comorbidities to jump the line, or, gasp, to dodge Sinovac in their Makati barangay and find a connection to get an AstraZeneca jab in Caloocan? Now, they’re happily teaching people how to do the same and get away with falsified comorbidities. How noble. How patriotic. How… just wow. Anyway, being a locally registered PWD because of my mental illness, and having diabetes, I qualified under the A3 category—age 18 to 59, with comorbidities. Because Marikina rocks (sorry, proud resident here, and I am not on LGU payroll), at least in our barangay, the physical forms were distributed; we were asked to attach a medical certificate or copy of latest prescription, and submit that to the barangay. Between submitting the forms and receiving a new one with a stub indicating my appointed date and time: One day. I was scheduled for April 8, 2:30 p.m., at Marikina Sports Center, and I went with a driver and a yaya from our family compound, who also had comorbidities. Let me also say for the record that, unfortunately, this may not be a common experience, and the fact is, your fate may be entirely dependent on the efficiency of your LGU, or even your specific barangay. There was no chaos when we arrived at 2:15 p.m.; people were directed to the left if they did not get to fill out the first form, and to the right if they already had a stub. It was warm, but not unbearable. Everywhere we went, employees wearing IDs directed us, checked our forms, and basically told us where to go and what to do. We sat in chairs, and transferred chairs to move up; it progressed so fast, by the time Bong, the driver, had arrived after finding a parking space, we were almost up. At the desk, my form and blood pressure were checked, with the reading written on the paper. There was an item asking you to choose your vaccine brand; the lady at the desk informed me that only Sinovac was available for now, but I could indicate if I was willing to wait for other brands to become available. I said I was ready. Bong, who has hypertension, and probably because he ran to catch up after finding a parking space, registered a high BP, and was asked to have it read again when we got to Stage 1, registration. We moved to a covered outside area, where properly distanced chairs were placed all the way to the end of the hall. Papers were checked again, with the lady telling me to have a copy of my prescription ready in case the doctor asks. It was another sit-down line before I was in front of a doctor, who confirmed my A3 status and asked how I was feeling. The form asked if you had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last 90 days; I barely made it, having caught it Jan. 5. After that, the next sit-down line was for Stage 2, vaccination. Ushers would call the next person in line whenever they saw an empty desk; I saw 10 desks. When I got there, the health worker took my form, filled out a vaccination ID for me indicating the date of my second dose (May 6), fished a vial from an insulated bag, and jabbed my left forearm ever so lightly, I wasn’t even aware the needle was in, seriously. (And I’m a veteran of jabs, blood extractions and intravenous chemotherapy.) She asked me to hold the cotton ball over it, handed the ID to me, and then directed me to wait in the observation area for 20 minutes to see if I felt anything. Another usher suggested I move closer to a huge electric fan, but I was fine. Time check: 3:15. As we were leaving after Bong had completed 20 minutes of waiting, who should I see but Marikina Mayor Marcy Teodoro standing beyond the observation area, talking to someone holding a camera. I fangirled, approached, thanked him for the seamless experience, and told him how proud I was of Marikina. No bodyguard blocked my way or asked me why I was sneaking closer to Mayor Marcy. When you’re doing your job, you have nothing to be afraid of, really. We were back home before 4 p.m., and my arm felt tender for a couple of hours. I Googled if it was OK to take a shower, and did so after confirming. I also felt some muscle pain in my shoulders that evening, so I skipped yoga class and napped. It’s the day after as I write this, and I feel fine, but have been told to still be observant. Many have asked me, from Marikina and elsewhere, what to do. Strangely, Marikina doesn’t seem to have online registration, but your barangay will have all the answers if you visit the office or call. Other cities do have online registration, so it’s all about waiting now. I have been monitoring my Facebook feed, with many people, seeing the large number of those who “fearlessly” opted for Sinovac and lived, deciding to register. (I myself was encouraged by the sight of Dr. Joven Cuanang, a spritely senior and a front-liner, getting it early on.) Many also asked how long before they could get another vaccine, probably still afraid that Sinovac wouldn’t be adequate. (I believe it’s supposed to be effective for a year, like a standard flu shot, but ask your doctor.) Again, that’s your option. All I know is, in a country where Filipinos are grateful when things actually work, my vaccination experience was a good one—mainly because I had faith in my local leaders. I feel good about getting vaccinated; at least I’ve done my part to make more people safe. Also, if your kasambahay and other less confident people are apprehensive, please convince them gently to get vaccinated, too. Don’t bully them; it’s still their bodies. And please lang: let’s not let misplaced racism (yes, when it comes to the vaccine, call it what it is) and myopic self-preservation guide our decisions. Let’s do a good jab.

Teaching Filipinos to be self-sufficient by growing own food,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/381306/teaching-filipinos-to-be-self-sufficient-by-growing-own-food/,"05:20 PM April 07, 2021","‘Filipinos still think that our food is ‘pantawid-gutom’; more than that, it is a reflection of identity’  Filipino Food Month (FFM) this April will yet again be celebrated virtually, leaving our eyes feasting on regional culinary delights. “The main goal of Filipino Food Month is to raise awareness of our gastronomy and to recognize Philippine cuisine as an art form,” said chef Jose Antonio Miguel “Jam” Melchor, FFM proponent and founder of the Philippine Culinary Heritage Movement (PCHM). FFM is conducted with partner agencies: the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) is highlighting food as culture; the Department of Agriculture (DA) is focusing on food security in this pandemic, while the Department of Tourism (DOT) will organize “Kain Na,” a market of produce and local food artisanal products, at Marquee Mall in Pampanga—barring restrictions. “Filipinos still think that our food is pantawid-gutom (something to ease hunger). More than that, it is a reflection of identity. Though our cuisine has yet to be recognized as an art form, our food is present in all occasions. Filipino food is diverse and each region has a story to tell,” said Melchor in a Zoom interview. As times become more challenging, FFM has become more meaningful. Culinary historian and panelist Felice Sta. Maria explained, “Because food is part of popular culture, FFM offers aspirational deliciousness through its webinars and cooking demonstrations. It reinforces home cooking as a family activity and heritage food as a means to strengthen affection and storytelling across generations and genders. Its theme ‘Iba’t Ibang Luto, Pinoy ang Puso’ draws everyone into the joy of the table.” “The Philippines on a Plate” webinars, a partnership with the NCCA, will discuss sapin-sapin and the rice culture (April 6); explore coconut and its products (April 8); moringa as the queen of vegetables (April 13); pansit (April 13); Philippine vinegar (April 15); and the food of Muslim Mindanao (April 22). FFM will pay homage to Maria Orosa, the chemist and war heroine, who developed nutritional solutions from Filipino foods (April 24). Meanwhile, the DA is focusing on capacity building by holding a program on high-value crops at its compound. Other webinars include backyard planting, plant-based food products, sources for alternative meat, fish deboning and making chopsuey from native vegetables. The public will be introduced to the making of regional specialties such as pinuneg (Filipino sausage of the Igorots), binamban (food made from wild grains, coconut and wrapped in a wild leaf) and kaluko (taro with coconut milk), foods of Western Visayas, ube, habhab, adlai, binaki (a steamed sweet corn cake), palagsing (sticky cake made of unaw or sago starch) and unaw-based products, tupig (glutinous rice cakes with coconut strips from Luzon), puto, burong Kapampangan and pinakbet. The DA is encouraging its regional offices to localize FFM through pop-up markets and cooking contests. The DOT is working with consulates and embassies in promoting FFM overseas. Plans are afoot for a Filipino food crawl in Australia and food festivals in Japan, Taiwan and Korea.Farmers will likewise be selling their harvests in pocket markets around the metropolis. They will be provided with transportation and free booths. FFM was a dream come true for Melchor when President Duterte supported his culinary heritage advocacy in 2018. Presidential Proclamation No. 469 declared April as National Filipino Food Month (Buwan ng Kalutong Filipino). In its debut year in 2019, FFM was celebrated with cooking demos and food fairs in the provinces, culinary tours, special events in restaurants and a monthlong food festival at Manila Hotel. Last year, Melchor, the PCHM and the partners were poised to celebrate FFM on a grander scale until the lockdown forced them to change course. The quick-thinking Melchor and the participants became one of the early adapters of webinars. The FFM advocacy afforded Melchor the leverage to get support from local governments in providing farmers’ products as ayuda in place of canned goods and instant noodles. “Instead of letting the vegetables rot, why not give them away? This was a win-win situation. People received fresh and wholesome food and the farmers earned their livelihood. The DA later created more venues for the farmers to dump their food during the long lockdown. We called on the private and government sectors to facilitate the transportation of food past the checkpoints,” he said. Local governments from Cotabato, Davao and Zamboanga followed the example to support their farmers. “Food security is the thrust of government agencies. This is the best time to teach people how to be self-sufficient by growing their own food and not wasting them. Choose food that can boost the immune system. At the moment, our only defense is nutrition,” said Melchor. Sta. Maria rejoined, “FFM also reminds us that food security is fundamental to national well-being. The pandemic has initiated a review of developmental strategies to prevent hunger, extreme hunger, and the resulting dilemmas they cause for public health and safety.” Asked if the virtual alternative for sensual experiences is effective in engaging people, she replied, “Our chefs, writers, content providers, production teams and presenters have become increasingly effective in producing food shows. Audiences already have their favorite shows with virtual feasts galore. FFM can build on all that.” The webinars can be viewed on the Facebook pages of FFM, PCHM, DA, NCCA and DOT. —CONTRIBUTED NCCA Public Affairs and Information Office; tel. 0928-5081057 or 85272192 loc. 625; email [email protected]  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"Friends, sisters and strangers: More personal pandemic heroes",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380775/friends-sisters-and-strangers-more-personal-pandemic-heroes/,"08:32 PM March 22, 2021"," We continue our series on personal pandemic heroes with stories about friends, sisters, even a stranger met through the sale of a used car, who have made a positive impact on other people’s lives during these challenging times. Video calls with my family made a difference. The amount of time may not be much, but the moments were priceless to me. It didn’t matter what we discussed; just knowing that they were out there gave me comfort. —Kooky Tuason Going through two trimesters of pregnancy and soon, the homestretch, is not an easy task. Fear and uncertainty creeps in, and I end up feeling like a first-time mom all over again. Everyday battles of morning sickness, mood swings, hormones and anxiety exacerbated by the lockdown situation is a frustrating experience. This was all cast aside by my husband Ryan. His heroic acts were his patience and tolerance. He would always respond to my quirks with kindness and understanding. He took up my responsibilities around the house and to our kids. Not only did he assume my household chores, but he also took care of my emotional state by making me feel calm, special and well taken care of. I appreciate my husband for being supportive and encouraging. He is my pandemic hero. —Terry Tantoco Dy  I am just happy to see my little sister Maiqui and my dog daughter Charcoal after a week of work, work, work. Maiqui gives me joy whenever I see her—it makes me happy to see that she’s growing up to be an intelligent, kind and funny woman. Charcoal, on the other hand, just gives me all the attention and energy I need. —Nyko Condenuevo Rodriguez Early in the lockdown, I got sick. It was strange because it was a low-grade fever for 13 days with no other symptoms. But we were on a lockdown and I couldn’t get tested, as testing was very limited. I was treated by our doctor as if I had COVID, and our entire household was on lockdown. I live in Salcedo Village, and I have a group of mommy friends here. Our children go to the same school. They were very instrumental in helping me get the medicine I needed, food for my family and batteries for my thermometer when it died out (I was checking my temperature hourly). Any time I needed something, someone would volunteer to secure it for me; either they would get it or they would get their husbands to do it and deliver to me. To this day, a year after the lockdown, we still buy fruits, rice or vegetables for one another. We definitely share our suppliers and recipes! To Michelle Ong, Maan Sicam, Tess Talusan and Charina Mendoza—you are my heroes. Thank you for being there when I needed the help and for continuing to be there when I need an onion or even a cup of flour. —Bess Howe My pandemic hero is my sister, Icka Santos. She is a teacher and she has been my hero for the longest time. When lockdown was announced in March last year and all the classes shifted online, she eased my worries by handling all the school requirements of my children. Icka turned our living room into a makeshift classroom and monitored all their school activities. She continued tutoring them amid her own adjustment in online teaching. Icka knew I needed help because I was a medical front-liner in a very novel situation. She was aware that there is a possibility for me not being able to go home after a call from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine or other hospitals. During the start of the enhanced community quarantine, she started Letter of Love Ph as a way to support the health-care workers emotionally. My med friends are also her friends. Icka also started free online classes for preschoolers called Morning Circle Time with Teacher Icka to help parents and their kids adjust to the “new normal.” Many parents messaged her to tell her that it made shifting to online school easier when the academic year started in August/September 2020. Late last year, she went to my room in the middle of the night and told me of her growing anxiety. I told her that it’s all right to feel that way, as we all can’t see the end of the road. I tried my best to ease her mind as much as she is still making things easier for me. It was such a relief for her, I think, when she learned I received my first dose of the vaccine. This is my sister, Icka, an aunt, a teacher, my support, my hero. Even if I say thank you a million times, it will never be enough. —Dr. Twinkle Santos My pandemic hero is a divorced man, and he is my hero because he made me see that it was better to be single again than to stay in a relationship where I don’t feel alive and connected. I met Mans because I was forced to buy a secondhand vehicle when public transportation was too risky. Mans had just come back from the United States where he worked for two decades. After his divorce from his wife of 10 years, he left his stable job in the United States and started a business of selling used cars here in the Philippines. We were both graduates of the University of the Philippines and because of that, I knew that we had a commonality in thinking, shared values and ideals. When I found out that he was the one who filed for divorce from his wife, and that it wasn’t because of a third party but from foresight that their future together was doomed, I felt that his story was mirroring mine. I was in a five-year relationship with Ben, a health-care professional. During the pandemic, I felt that Ben was unnecessarily burdening our relationship with his constant worries and anxieties. I realized that this has been a trend in our relationship, that Ben always expected me to be the stronger person, and that I would always be there to ease his troubles. But the pandemic happened, and it made me question the foundation of my relationship with Ben. In these trying times, it is not selfishness to want freedom from toxicity, but basic self-care. With daily life getting harder and heavier to bear, it made me question whether there were enough reasons to stay. My pandemic hero, Mans, strengthened my resolve to be free again and to experience the joys of singlehood. To have this time to know myself better, to be more connected, and be attuned to my needs and desires. To not tie up my value with the person I’m in a relationship with. To be independent, and to finally accept that I am capable of having a loving and healthy relationship with myself, one which I usually seek in romantic relationships. That I am a strong woman and that I don’t need to be pressured into settling just to fit in with societal demands. Truly, the pandemic brought drastic changes in our lifestyle, and in my case, it made me want to have a happier future, even though, in the process, I had to break out of a relationship heading for marriage. Never mind that I am alone in facing the challenges of this pandemic; it is in these difficult times that I realize that I value my happiness and freedom more. —Rebecca (not her real name) Want to tell us about your pandemic hero?

Nourished by Wawa’s love,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380662/nourished-by-wawas-love/,"07:25 PM March 19, 2021","‘Rain or shine, as soon as the lunch bell rang, I would race to the cafeteria where she would be waiting with fresh, piping-hot food’  I grew up eating food prepared by my wawa. Wawa was my mom’s aunt, who lived with us. She oversaw our whole household like a general and the kitchen was her domain. It was clear that cooking was not just a chore to her, but more an expression of love and care for us. Every Saturday, she would get up at the crack of dawn to go to the market, where she would banter with and cajole her suki for the best meat, fish, fruit and vegetables. She would meticulously look over slabs of meat and pork, poking, smelling and turning the pieces over and insisting, much to the chagrin of her butcher suki, on the choicest parts to be carved out and double ground or chopped (evenly, mind you). The strong-armed butchers knew better than to argue with my formidable wawa. She could switch from being charming to intimidating in the blink of an eye, and I guess they preferred her charming. When she was done meat shopping, she would proceed to procure poultry and seafood in the same fashion, making sure that she got the freshest and finest. Her favorite stop was the vegetable stall. It was owned by a former neighbor of hers, and my wawa, a consummate multitasker, would catch up and reminisce with her friend while carefully choosing her vegetables. Of course, she insisted on discounts and freebies as well before waving goodbye. When she got home, she would oversee the unpacking and repacking of the food items, making sure that everything was properly labeled. She would then have coffee and pan de sal then proceed to cook our lunch. I was raised on a diet of Filipino food staples—nilaga, afritada, tinola, all kinds of sinigang, almondigas and adobo which my wawa made with pork and chicken liver. We also had fried chicken, shaken in a bag of flour and seasoning, her special hamburger which none of us has been able to replicate, lumpiang Shanghai and her sweet spaghetti. Even our merienda was homemade—turon, palitaw, maruya, tuna sandwiches. When I was in grade school, my wawa would notice that I was ravenous when I arrived from school. I told her that I couldn’t (wouldn’t) eat cafeteria food because it tasted nothing like her cooking. She was discomfited because none of my siblings had this issue. Nevertheless, being the persuasive and caring person that she was, she got permission from our school to bring me lunch every single day, citing some vague health concern (malnutrition or allergy to mystery meats drowned in gravy). Rain or shine, as soon as the lunch bell rang, I would race to the cafeteria where my wawa would be waiting with a table set with my own placemat, plate, utensils and water glass. Together we would unpack fresh, piping-hot food, and my wawa would watch me and smile contentedly as I finished my lunch. Last year, my wawa passed away at the age of 90. Her loss is keenly felt by all in my family, but her passing was especially poignant for me because I couldn’t be there for her, as I was battling my own health crisis then. The most difficult part of my cancer treatment ended during the lockdown. When my taste buds reawakened, a casualty of that treatment, I would ask my mom to prepare food that she learned to make from our wawa. Eating food that is lovingly prepared almost has a sacramental aspect to it. Cooking is not just an art and science, but a language of love above all. I also started to crave dessert, most especially ice cream. Since we were still on strict lockdown, my daughter and I tried our hand at making our own ice cream. I miss Wawa, but I didn’t want her to haunt me, so we used the best ingredients we could source. Our efforts were rewarded by delicious, creamy products that Wawa would have loved. Since we had a lot of time on our hands and were in danger of going stark raving mad from cabin fever, we churned out so much ice cream that we started sending some to our friends and family. With their encouragement, we began selling our ice cream along with cookies under the brand name Mootown. Taking inspiration from my wawa’s cooking language of love and my own learnings through chef Reggie Aspiras, Mootown’s flavors are a mix of old-time favorites and new flavors made from the very best ingredients. I hope that those who have the opportunity to partake of our products will experience a bit of the love my wawa lavished upon me and my family. (Adapted from Ready For Dessert) This is an ice cream recipe for those who want to try their hand at ice cream making without buying a machine first. 170 g bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped 1 c plus 2 Tbsp whole or low-fat milk 1 c plus 2 Tbsp Bailey’s Irish Cream 3 very ripe medium bananas, peeled and cut into chunks 3 Tbsp dark rum In a small heatproof bowl, combine the chocolate and milk. Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove bowl from heat. Pour the liqueur into a blender or food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add the bananas, rum and the melted chocolate mixture and purée until smooth. Pour the mixture in a shallow plastic container, cover and freeze at least eight hours, preferably overnight.

Keeping fit with just body weight and little equipment,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380632/keeping-fit-with-just-body-weight-and-little-equipment/,"04:33 PM March 19, 2021","Events host and travel guy Kevin Lapeña on his fitness secret: ‘Changing up your diet really helps if you want to lose weight and avoid having your gains plateau’  Kevin Lapeña has always been into fitness. “My dad’s a fitness professional, and someone who’s really passionate about sports and keeping healthy. So I suppose it was natural for me to have picked up on it at an early age. “Physical exercise—be it through sports, working out in a gym or just going for a run—has always been my personal source of balance and a staple of my day-to-day,” said the 30-year-old TV and events host and travel media producer. The pandemic had a big impact on Lapeña’s career, since the two main industries he’s part of—travel media and live events—took a huge hit. “But one of the good things that came out of this was that I started to explore content creating. I had to be creative in still maintaining my presence. So I started vlogging about events and voice-over work, and I’ve started a pocket travel series that I’d just shoot from my home studio, where I’d feature different destinations around the Philippines.” Now, he’s back to hosting live and virtual events. “My travel media work has slowly been coming alive again, too! I’ve been shooting promotional videos for local tourism boards, as well as producing features for hotels and going on fam trips to local destinations.” Fitness continues to be a big part of his life, of course. Here, he shares his secrets to staying healthy. My fitness regimen: The kind of exercise routine I follow really varies, depending on my goals, say, if I’m preparing for a race or if I want to bulk up or cut. The exercises I’ve been doing these past few months have mainly been to keep healthy and to just maintain my fitness. I mostly run outside or on the treadmill, followed by doing exercises from the NTC (Nike Training Club) app (my favorite workouts are the “Head to Toe Meltdown” and the “Boxer Burner”) and by doing resistance training through bodyweight exercises, free weights, and, on occasion, going to the gym. My favorite workouts and exercises: I love endurance training. I used to be a big weights guy but when I started doing endurance sports back in 2015, endurance workouts have been my go-to exercises, specifically running, cycling and swimming. Swimming is my favorite, since you get so much out of it and with the least amount of impact on your joints! My workout frequency: I always try to work out as often as I can. Pre-COVID, I’d work out six to seven days a week! But now, because of all the limitations and the mental and physical fatigue of a year’s worth of community quarantine, I’d work out two to four times in a week, on average. Five, if I’m feeling motivated. I work out … Mostly at home, indoors for the functional workouts and resistance training, and outdoors, for when I run. But on some occasions, I go to the gym, just to squeeze in a proper workout with weights and machines and all. My fitness must-haves: My No. 1 priority has always been music. It’s what keeps me motivated throughout my workouts and helps me push myself on lazy days. So you’d always see me with earphones on when I exercise. I make sure to use in-ear/bluetooth earphones so I’m not bothered by dangling cables and so they keep in place no matter how much I move around. A set of must-haves as well are resistance bands and/or dumbbells, and an exercise mat. If I have these with me, I’d be good, no matter where I am. And lastly, a face mask for when I run. My workout playlist: Thing is, I’m really big on music and I enjoy listening to all kinds of genres, so it really depends on my mood! It can range from the usual genres like rock and hip-hop to classical and even Broadway! But lately, I’ve been listening to a lot of alternative music—Interpol, The Killers, Them Crooked Vultures and The Shins, to name a few. My diet: I do intermittent fasting, where I’d usually only eat once or twice a day, and when it’s time to eat, I make sure to still eat healthy, by eating a lot of greens, staying away from junk food, managing my portions, etc. Unless there’s chocolate. Then that’d be the exception. Haha.  In a day, I usually eat … Vegetables for the most part, like a salad, or stir-fried kangkong with garlic and tofu (my favorite) and some muesli for dessert. But when I’m hungry, I like eating fish or chicken with rice (or cauliflower rice, if I’m feeling responsible). One health hack I recently started doing as well is drinking apple cider vinegar every morning. I’ve always had problems with hyperacidity and this thing completely took it away! Not only that, it helps keep my gut healthy too! What’s off-limits: Junk food! Chips in particular. I’ve always been a big snacker, and once I start snacking on chips, it’ll almost be impossible for me to stop! It’s always been one of my weaknesses, too, so I try my best to keep away from it, whenever I can. Cheat days: I think this is really important to have, especially if you’d want to have a sustainable commitment to eating and staying healthy. It keeps the sanity intact too and the cravings at bay. I usually allow myself to enjoy during the weekend, either on Fridays and/or Sundays. Sky’s the limit here! Fast-food, pizza, beer, you name it! What keeps me motivated: Overall life balance, I suppose. I remember talking about this recently, where every time I’d think about how the “best version” of myself would look like, in all its different iterations and scenarios, the common factor in all those is me being fit and healthy. It keeps me centered, anchored and I am at my happiest when my body feels good. That aside, I wear suits a lot because of my hosting work and suit pants can get pretty tight! So if not for life balance and all that, this is a pretty huge motivator for me! How the pandemic affected my fitness routine: It really messed it up, unfortunately. I would go to the gym six to seven days a week before the pandemic and was never really into home workouts. But being stuck in a condo for months without going out taught me how to keep fit with just my body weight and little to no equipment. It was a huge adjustment process for me, but when I started getting the hang of it, there were times that I even preferred it more than using machines. Now, I’ve started to incorporate endurance exercises again and staying outdoors to get fresh air and sunlight. It still takes a conscious effort on my end to maintain my routine. But so long as I keep myself healthy, with everything that’s going on, I suppose that’s more than enough for me. More fitness secrets: I’m not sure if it’s a secret, but I find that changing up your diet really helps if you want to lose weight and to avoid having your gains plateau. I’ve been eating plant-based for a few years until I noticed that I wasn’t looking and feeling as good as I used to. Then I started experimenting with other diets and introduced meat into my diet again and to my surprise, it worked wonders! I leaned out and gained muscle, too! Tips for people who want to get healthier: Take it one day at a time. More often than not, people stop their fitness journey before they even really get to begin. It can definitely get overwhelming thinking about all the things you’d need to do, like exercising, being conscious about what you eat and changing your lifestyle. So best to ease into it first. There’s no need to rush into training hard right away, so do what’s comfortable for yourself first, and as long as you’re consistent with it, the progress and the gains will come.

Anya Resort Tagaytay is first Asian resort to offer Far Infrared Spa Therapy,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380610/anya-resort-tagaytay-is-first-asian-resort-to-offer-far-infrared-spa-therapy/,"01:24 PM March 19, 2021","MANILA, Philippines – As hotels and resorts begin to open their doors to travelers, several key hospitality venues are taking steps by which they can help their guests feel safer and healthier without needing to compromise comfort and the promise of a relaxing, stress-free stay. Anya Resort Tagaytay managed by AHG, one of the leading hospitality hubs south of Manila, is taking the lead by bringing in a revolutionary wellness device: France’s Vital Dome. Anya will begin offering the infratherapy machine among its wellness amenities of on March 1, 2021. “We are proud to play a part in Anya’s commitment to giving its guests safer and healthier staycations through our Vital Dome and other innovative solutions,” says Katherine Alejar, CEO and Chief Innovator for i3, the Vital Dome’s exclusive distributor in the country. “Anya is the first resort in the country to bring in this healthful technology and we hope that other hotels and resorts will follow suit.” Just an hour and a half away from the capital, Anya has offered luxurious stays paired with exceptional amenities and fine cuisine. The addition of the Vital Dome to its excellent roster of wellness amenities is expected to give guests a truly relaxing and rejuvenating experience whenever they come over. Paired with the resort’s holistic environment and calm natural surroundings, it offers an unparalleled experience that will leave guests rested, refreshed, and renewed in both mind and body. Guests who wish to try the latest addition to Anya’s fitness and wellness amenities can try it out at the resort’s Niyama Wellness Center as a standalone treatment. Use of the Vital Dome are included in future suite and staycation packages to give patrons the experience of a truly relaxing and rejuvenating stay. Patented and manufactured in France, the Vital Dome uses Far Infrared Rays (FIRs) generated by carbon panels within the device to give users a sense of relaxation and renewed well-being. Unlike traditional saunas or massage machines, the Vital Dome’s FIRs penetrate deep into the skin, accelerating regeneration on a cellular level as it safely raises the body’s core temperature. This enables the body to sweat out toxins and other impurities as a way to stay healthy and keep infections at bay. Likewise, the regenerative action of the FIRs reduces internal inflammation which, in turn, helps in long-term pain management. It is also instrumental in healthy weight management and body shaping. The fact that the Vital Dome is also a hands-free experience will also help boost consumer confidence in hotels and resorts, enable them to comply with relevant health protocols and ordinances, and encourage their recovery on reopening. “Anya isn’t just the first resort in the country to have the Vital Dome,” Alejar is quick to add. “There may already be a Dome in place at Hong Kong’s W Hotel, but our presence at Anya is also the first-ever for any Southeast Asian hospitality destination.” But this unique wellness machine is no stranger to the hospitality industry, as numerous hotels and spas across Europe now offer it among their health, wellness, and aesthetic amenities. Among those that already have the Vital Dome in place are the Hotel Prince of Wales in Paris, the Hotel Barriere Le Royale in Deuville, and the Hotel Sassongher in Badia BZ, Italy. Alejar has expressed hopes that the installation of the Vital Dome at Anya Resort Tagaytay will encourage other hotels and resorts in the country to bring this health-giving device to their own locations.

LOOK: Maxene Magalona catches up with best friends after return to PH,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380356/look-maxene-magalona-catches-up-with-best-friends-after-return-to-ph/,"04:07 PM March 14, 2021","Now back in the Philippines, actress and yoga instructor Maxene Magalona touched base with her best friends whom she has not seen for a long while. Magalona talked to two of her best friends via Zoom and shared her fondest memories of her friendship with them, as seen on her Instagram post yesterday, March 13. She also showed a screenshot of her Zoom session with them. “Another way that I like to keep myself in check is by touching base with my best friends who are genuinely and sincerely honest with me. We’ve been friends for more than a decade so we already know how to communicate with each other,” she said. For Magalona, “real friends are not the ones who will always just say yes and agree with you” but “are the ones who know how to have healthy and mature conversations with you and even call you out when needed.”   Isang post na ibinahagi ni Maxene Magalona-Mananquil (@maxenemagalona)  Magalona believes that the kind of friends she keeps are “the ones who fully support and accept [her] without judgment but will be the first to tell [her] when [she’s] wrong”. “The ones who are not afraid to speak up and tell you what you need to hear because they know that it’s for your own good,” she stressed. Magalona recalled how her best friends were so worried when she went on a solo trip to Boracay years ago after being “newly single.” “They knew that I wasn’t in a good place mentally and emotionally. I, of course, did not listen and still chose to continue with my trip,” she recalled. The hunch of her best friends was right as Magalona went through a lot of hassles during that trip. “I got blackout drunk everyday, lost my phone while my bag somehow ended up in the police station and missed my flight back to Manila where I was supposed to go straight to work,” she said. This is why she trusts these friends of hers, and she is grateful to them for keeping her sane and for looking out for her. “Thank you, @morenita.garcia85 and @saritalazaro1 for your friendship and acceptance even when I was still mentally unwell,” she said. “Your unconditional love, honesty and non-judgment have truly been instrumental in my healing.” Magalona along with her husband, musician and yoga teacher Rob Mananquil, were stranded in Bali for a year due to the lockdowns and travel bans imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Magalona has returned to the Philippines, Mananquil is still in Bali as per his Instagram Story today, where he is undergoing yoga teacher training.

From power classes to choosing to breathe: A yoga mom’s journey,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/380197/from-power-classes-to-choosing-to-breathe-a-yoga-moms-journey/,"08:46 PM March 09, 2021","‘There are lessons in doing less. There is value in rest’  This week, Lifestyle introduces Fitness Diaries, a series that features people’s secrets to trying to stay healthy. We’re kicking things off with Trina Sotto, a 38-year-old full-time mom to two boys and a certified Vinyasa, prenatal and postpartum yoga teacher. “Since the pandemic hit, I’ve been doing my best to keep a nurturing, loving environment for the family, and teaching yoga classes online,” she said. Two years ago, Sotto was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition. “My weight easily fluctuates. I can lose weight easily, but I can also gain it back easily. I deal with hair loss, muscle mass loss, dry skin especially in the shins, fatigue and a heart rate that’s higher than normal, among many others.” But that hasn’t stopped her from continuing to move. “Exercise has always been part of my life. I liked playing sports when I was younger. I enjoyed going to the gym. Yoga has been part of my life for 18 years now. I also used to run a lot before I had a knee injury in 2018, and before the symptoms of my autoimmune condition kicked in.” My fitness regimen: Prior to the pandemic, I’d do yoga maybe five to six times a week, and spend time at the gym to do cardio and some weight training one to three times a week. I haven’t been to the gym for a year now. I no longer practice the physical aspect of yoga as frequently, because my role as a wife and mother supersedes everything else. But there’s a form of movement every day. So whether I have 10 or 60 minutes to myself per day, I will exercise. But my routine is no longer strenuous. I only do low impact exercises and prefer gentler classes. I try to work out daily but if my body tells me to rest, or begin to feel unwell, I will. My favorite workouts and exercises: I love yoga, because I find I get a “work in” as much as a workout when I practice. My fellow yoga teachers discovered a fun cardio workout timed to party music, and I would take those classes from time to time, too. Doing it regularly isn’t sustainable, though, because my heart rate spikes too quickly. I’ve resumed jogging last month, although even at a slow pace, my heart rate reached 200-plus so I had to stop immediately. I miss my strong body and the things I used to enjoy, but a heart attack is not worth it. There are days that are so busy that I really have no time for myself since I do all the chores at home. On those days, I either rest completely or, if I have energy, I’ll squeeze in 100 squats, sometimes while I’m in the shower. Every day is leg day! I work out in… Our dining area-slash-yoga studio. It magically transforms into a yoga area when I teach classes. (Laughs) My husband pushes the furniture aside so I have space to teach. If playing “Just Dance” with the kids counts as exercise, then count our living room, too. I’ve tried jogging outdoors where we live, but I felt unsafe. I also considered returning to the gym in our building, but I’d rather play it safe. My fitness must-haves: A yoga mat, yoga blocks, straps, bolster and blanket. I have resistance bands that I like using for my leg exercises. I don’t use my fitness ball as much nowadays, so I only bring it out when I want to incorporate it in my prenatal and postpartum yoga classes. I have 3-kilogram dumbbells, but I haven’t used them in the last month. My 6-year-old foam roller has been very helpful since I haven’t gotten a massage or seen a physical therapist since the quarantine. I use a Google Home display to stream classes. I wear a heart rate monitor daily. Comfortable workout clothes that wick away sweat are very important, because I’m in them the whole day! My workout playlist: The classes I stream usually have their own music, so I just go with the flow. When I’m working out on my own, I would either pick a random playlist on Spotify, or select one of the playlists I’d made for my Vinyasa yoga classes in the physical studios. There are times I don’t put music on. My diet: I love eating—it’s my only hobby now! (Laughs) There were periods in the last three years when I stopped eating meat. But when I got hyperthyroidism in 2019, I had to stop eating seafood and return to eating meat until my blood work improved. I’ve lessened meat consumption in the last four years, though, preferring plant-based options and meat substitutes. And since I’m in charge of meals (or ordering them), my whole family adapts to my diet. We don’t consume white rice on a regular basis (just this month because we got a sack as a gift, and we’ve already noticed rounder bellies). I refrain from cooking with iodized salt because of my thyroid issues. I’ve cut back on dairy consumption, too. In a day, I usually eat… Anything and everything. I no longer deprive myself of food. I find that it’s when I go on strict diets that my health and well-being really suffer! If I overindulge, I will do some form of fasting, or go on a liquid diet. What keeps me motivated: I work out for several reasons. It feels good; it gives me some much-needed alone time; it allows me to stay healthy, which then helps me care for the people around me—who are dependent on me—better. In my life, I’ve been fat and thin, and everything in between, so physical appearance was never really a motivation for me to stay a certain shape. Although it helps to know that I still fit in old clothes! I enjoy the process, not necessarily the challenge or the goal. For me, it’s always about the journey, and the self-realizations that come with it, and not the destination. How the pandemic affected my fitness routine: At the start of the pandemic, I continued to take power classes that ran for 60-90 minutes. It was not sustainable. The amount of work that needed to be done at home, plus having the family home 24/7, meant zero opportunity for breaks, or at least to do things in peace. It got exhausting. Then I had to shift to teaching classes online, which is harder than teaching live [in-person] classes, in my opinion. You have to prepare your space, set up your gadgets, ensure connectivity, shout into the microphone so your cues come in clearly, watch people through tiny boxes, and demonstrate most of the class. It’s a lot of work. In terms of attending classes, I could not consistently make it to live, online classes because of the family’s schedule (i.e., my older son has a test, so he needs the internet bandwidth, or the class I want to take conflicts with meal preparation time), so I have to settle for recorded classes most of the time. Many times, I felt frustrated that my own personal practice was put on hold. But motherhood is a yoga practice in itself—a constant practice of surrender, of accepting things with grace, managing our emotions and our ego, savoring every moment, choosing to breathe, and letting go of things that do not serve us. Tips for people who want to get healthier: Start small. Never force yourself into doing something that doesn’t feel right. Exercise can be uncomfortable, but if it brings you pain or injury, then it’s counterproductive. I no longer subscribe to the “no pain, no gain” mentality. Find something you enjoy so exercise doesn’t feel like torture—unless you’re into that! (Laughs)There are lessons in doing less. There is value in rest. Honor what your body can and cannot do at the moment. Practice mindfulness—in eating, savor every bite; in exercising, do it with intention. Want to share your fitness diary?

Those Vexing Vaccine Questions,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/379782/those-vexing-vaccine-questions/,"01:04 PM March 02, 2021","We live in truly remarkable times when a global pandemic effectively paralyzes the world, but scientists race to create a vaccine against a deadly virus in a record six months. Vaccines usually take five to ten years at the very least to develop, so the speed with which the various coronavirus vaccines, quite understandably, raises not a few questions. To take or not to take? A year into the pandemic, with significant swathes of the global population already vaccinated or preparing to be vaccinated, some countries have seen a notable drop in hospital admissions and deaths due to COVID-19. Why is there still a resistance to the vaccine among certain quarters? I asked my driver the other day whether he would take the vaccine, which I would pay for if his barangay didn’t offer it to residents for free. He hemmed and hawed and said, I don’t know. My helper also said she wasn’t sure whether she’d consent to be vaccinated.  A few days before, she had marveled at how her friend, an OFW in Israel, had already received her second dose.  But, she added, what about the Filipina OFW in Dubai who got both shots, came back home to the Philippines, and developed COVID-19? I honestly don’t understand where this hesitation is coming from. Still, anti-vaxxers seem to have instilled a wariness in many people, despite the obvious and empirically proven effectiveness of vaccines in eradicating the disease. There is also the issue of mistrust in the government’s credibility, largely due to the Dengvaxia scandal. But that is a failure of competence and communication, not necessarily of the vaccine itself. And the same thing will happen again with the COVID vaccine if the government keeps bungling everything up. My driver said that he wanted to wait and see first before deciding whether to take the vaccine. Wait and see is something of a disingenuous stalling tactic here. Wait for and see what, exactly? For case numbers to spike and deaths to shoot up? Or wait for the vaccine to fail? Or wait for COVID to get him? As for my helper, I asked her if she’d been vaccinated as a child. “Yes, of course,” she replied.  She’d had all the vaccines as a child – polio, BCG, measles, mumps, rubella, as well as diphtheria, whooping cough, and typhoid. “Did you ever get polio? Or mumps? Or typhoid?” “No, of course not.  I was vaccinated.” “So why won’t you take the COVID vaccine?” “My sister-in-law told me that Bill Gates would insert a microchip into us when we get the vaccine.” Why do people choose to believe superstition over science? Her reasoning made me wonder what supplemental information Bill Gates might want to harvest from a microchip being inserted into every person that Facebook or any other social media platform hasn’t already made you hand over so willingly. We’re talking about global health and safety here.  I think that everyone – with the possible exception of Republicans and other COIVD deniers – wants a return to some semblance of normal, a world they can navigate with a sense of security that comes with being protected beyond wearing masks and staying six feet away from each other. Even the Pope has put his trust in the science behind the vaccines and by now would have taken his first dose at the very least. Considering Pope Francis’ advanced age, he certainly falls into the vulnerable category. However, more than trust in science, the Pope points out the community aspect inherent in the fight against COVID. “I believe that morally everyone must take the vaccine,” he said in an interview on Italian television.  “It is the moral choice because it is about your life but also the lives of others.” This is why achieving herd immunity is so important.  As I told my helper, the vaccine may not totally prevent you from getting Covid-19, although the chances are extremely rare. Still, it will almost certainly be a mild case requiring no hospitalization and will almost certainly not lead to death. What if they brought in a vaccine and no one wanted it? This is, unfortunately, a loaded question. Not content with being one of the two countries with the worst-performing economies, the Philippines is also the last country in Southeast Asia to receive the vaccines. The arrival of a COVID vaccine on our shores should normally be cause for relief and a certain measure of jubilation.  The fact that it’s the Chinese vaccine Sinovac has not exactly elicited much enthusiasm. Even medical personnel aren’t exactly queuing up to get their jabs of Sinovac. If only China didn’t have a reputation for the shameless manufacture of fakes… If only China hadn’t tried to suppress the very first reports of coronavirus infections… If only China had been more transparent with the WHO… Then perhaps people would be more comfortable about taking Sinovac. It’s telling that the government has told frontliners that they are not obliged to take Sinovac if they prefer another vaccine brand. It’s also telling that my staff is adamantly opposed to taking the Chinese vaccine either.   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"This Pampanga garden is a colorful, serene paradise",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/379661/this-pampanga-garden-is-a-colorful-serene-paradise/,"11:34 PM February 25, 2021","Passing through this quiet setting feels as if one had discovered a mysterious pool, serenaded by chirping birds  The lady of the estate sits contentedly in her favorite spot, the porch, which overlooks her fish ponds, filled with tilapia and giant freshwater prawns. Her estate in Macabebe, Pampanga, has views of Mt. Arayat, mountain ranges in Zambales, Clark and Cagayan. Layered with lush plants, the porch invites anybody to relax and savor the countryside. Peruvian ferns, dangling from the eaves, lend a soothing effect. The tables are decorated with sculptural cacti while the corners are softened with air-purifying indoor plants—anthuriums, Zanzibar gems (welcome plants) and rare fortune plants. Every sunset, the owner gazes at the flock of birds that has picked up their catch from the waters. The estate, comprised of two houses built with architectural salvages, is surrounded by artistically composed gardens that make her home a world of its own. A lover of antiques and plants, Macabebe Vice Mayor Annette Balgan tapped landscape artist-contractor Shirley Sanders to transform her property into a tropical showpiece. Sanders chose plants that were not only easy to maintain but could thrive in brackish water since the ponds exposed them to seawater and saltwater. At the entrance, a colorful explosion of low-maintenance bougainvilleas and adelfas welcomes guests. Bougainvilleas are one of Sanders’ favorite flowers because these don’t need much watering. The visual journey begins at the fork of Balgan’s property which leads to two houses. The façade of the older house, whose character is enhanced by the patina of aged wood, is dramatized by tall pandanus sanderianas with flowing ribbon-like leaves, and palm trees. Hedges of dwarf pandakaki and rosewood act like living screens. Red and white lilies and crinums offset the green plants. The fragrance of orange jasmine drifts through the air. A bridge over an inlet leads to the main house which is partially obscured by bougainvilleas, hibiscuses and banderas españolas. Their exuberant colors stir up happy feelings. The estate’s main feature, the koi pond, is enveloped with rocks and travesias or old railroad tile, festooned with bromeliads and sumatras, delicate golden lilies, dwarf pandanus and date palms. Agaves emerge from giant kawas or antique metal pans. The sight of sculptural bonsais—bucidas, ficuses and camachile—atop the travesias brings a sense of calm. Passing through this quiet setting feels as if one had discovered a mysterious pool, serenaded by chirping birds. While most visitors would be naturally drawn toward the garden compositions near the ponds, Sanders created vignettes, using Balgan’s accessories, to entice visitors to look at other parts of the landscape. Across the pond, an old seater made of aged mahogany is decked with hibiscuses and philodendrons. Large clay jars are surrounded by flowering rosewoods, white crinums and foxtails that play against ornamental travelers and Manila palms. The carved entrance door of the main house is protected by a statue of St. Padre Pio standing amid the Chinese evergreens, forest anthuriums, welcome plants and poinsettias. The icon is juxtaposed with other antique finds and foliage that add a play on scale and textures. The fragile asparagus plants temper the roughness of the giant metal pots. An aged sugarcane grinder and Oriental ceramic jars are clustered with spiny-leaved cycas and asparagus ferns. Cacti and curly ferns clamber down the Vigan jars. In another part of the garden, an old wooden cart showcases colorful bougainvilleas. An old mortar, the lusong, becomes a plant holder for bold Chinese evergreens, jade flowers and ferns. A pocket garden becomes a serene paradise with a statue of St. Francis blessing the flowering red gingers and heliconias. Seifrizii palms, cone gingers and papaya trees add a layer of privacy to the main shower area. Giving equal importance to indoor plants, Sanders cites snake plants, Chinese evergreens, fortune plants, forest anthuriums, selloums, licualas or ruffled plants are therapeutic as they clean the air and quiet down your nerves. Aside from displaying them in the right spots, she arranges plants in odd numbers and uses different shapes and sizes for an organic look. When Balgan is asked if she gets bored living alone (aside from the helpers), she replies, “I’m surrounded by plants, and I read books. I don’t need to go out and risk my health.” CONTRIBUTED    CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021

Magalona articulated what she gains from doing yoga in her Instagram post yesterday, Feb. 17. “When I started my yoga and meditation journey, I honestly thought that it was just a physical and mental practice that was meant to keep our bodies fit and our minds sharp. After diving deeper into this rabbit hole, I realized that it is so much more than just asanas and breathwork,” she said. But it was more than what she expected as “this practice is what has helped me develop a healthy and strong relationship not only with myself but also with the energies surrounding me, the Universe as a whole and God, the Divine Source.” “I noticed that the more I devote my time and energy to this daily ritual, the more I become in tune with myself,” the actress observed. Doing daily yoga exercises has brought Magalona “healing” and “inner peace”. “By showing up on my mat [every day], I am able to check in with myself, communicate with my body, observe my thoughts, calibrate my energy, nourish my soul and connect to God. This is how I start my day. This is how I heal and find inner peace,” she said. Magalona and husband Rob Manaquil are yoga instructors and have been deepening their yoga practice while based in Bali, Indonesia for the past year. With that, she is set to head a gentle yoga and meditation class at the virtual wellbeing festival YOUfest on Feb. 27 at 8 a.m. NVG RELATED STORIES: WATCH: Andi Eigenmann chooses to be ‘positive’ in dealing with postpartum depression Maxene Magalona assures fans she has no eating disorder  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
What’s your vaccination priority score?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/379268/whats-your-vaccination-priority-score/,"02:27 PM February 17, 2021","A system can be drafted by experts based on scientific evidence, to determine who are suitable to receive it (Second of two parts) A patient told me that their barangay official advised them that their 85-year-old bedridden mother, who had already suffered two strokes, is at high risk for COVID-19 and is considered a priority for vaccination. I advised my patient that the family has to weigh the pros and cons of vaccinating their mother more intently before consenting to her vaccination. This highlights the need for a more rational government policy in identifying those who are suitable for vaccination, and prioritizing them. The government should aim for a more realistic goal of vaccinating 70 percent of the population, who are suitable to be vaccinated. The qualifying word “suitable” should be emphasized. Aiming for 100-percent vaccination is either just rhetorical or even irrational, and unfounded scientifically. The evidence is accumulating that the vaccine may even be potentially harmful to some people. It’s not a one-size-fits-all proposition. So, the government cannot just make a sweeping plan of vaccinating everyone. It’s conceded that vaccination is the most viable option we have at the moment for the country to survive this pandemic. The government may even invoke its constitutionally mandated police power which is inherent in any sovereign state, and make it mandatory for everyone to get vaccinated, but I personally think that would be a bad idea. Everyone should still be given the free will to decide. So, informed consent must be obtained before anyone gets a vaccination shot. No consent, no vaccination. Or else, the government could be accused of violating the human rights of a vulnerable population, constrained to decide out of fear. We need a good communication plan that can lay the facts to the public as they are, and not give any impression that the pharma companies, international health agencies and national governments are keeping their cards close to their chest, unwilling to reveal information that may help the people make intelligent decisions for themselves and their country. If there is a feeling of trust and everyone is convinced that there is full transparency on information that can impact the recipients of the vaccine, then there’s a great likelihood to get more to favor the vaccination. It would indeed be a tragedy if our government is able to procure all the vaccine doses we need, but only a minority of the population would be willing to receive it. To gain the public’s favor, we need a more rational method, consisting of an easy-to-understand explanation to convince them. We now realize that the vaccines are not exactly the silver bullet we imagined they would be. There may even be segments of the population who may be possibly at risk to suffer from significant side effects with the vaccine, like the frail and the elderly. So, a scoring system can be drafted by our experts based on available scientific evidence, to determine those who are really suitable for vaccination and are likely to benefit from it, with no or little risk of harm. The vaccination scoring system should determine all factors that could impact risk of exposure and getting infected, risk of severe disease, and the benefit that may be derived from the vaccine. These include age, occupation, means of transportation and pertinent medical history. It also factors in conditions that may increase the risk of potential harm to the vaccine recipient such as old age and frailty, or presence of an unstable long-standing (chronic) disease. All the factors for benefits (positive points) and harm (negative points) will be given corresponding points, and the sum total of the positive and negative factors will determine their suitability for vaccination. This is illustrated in the proposed table accompanying this article. The higher the total score, the more suitable the individual is for vaccination. Those with low scores should not be prioritized; and those with net negative scores are not considered that suitable for vaccination. The risk for harm may even exceed the potential for benefit in such patients. In the case of our patient’s 85-year-old mother, with recurrent stroke and currently bedridden, she gets zero point for age, no score for work and means of transportation since she’s already bedridden, and a -3 points for being bedridden and frail. So her total score is -3. That makes her unsuitable for vaccination, since the potential for harm may be greater. On the other hand, if you’re a 45-year-old traffic policeman, you get +3 for age, +3 for work as a nonmedical front-liner, +1 for means of transportation if you have your own vehicle. So, even if you have no comorbid medical condition, your total score is +7, which makes you a top priority. If you have a comorbid condition like hypertension or diabetes, your score is even higher. A 30-year-old nurse assigned to the COVID-19 ward gets +3 for age, +4 for her work as a health-care front-liner, +3 for means of transportation if she commutes to work. So, her total score is +10 ,which really justifies her being a top priority. With such a methodical and rational way to determine suitability or unsuitability for vaccination, it should be easier to convince suitable candidates for vaccination. As previously explained, to achieve herd immunity, we only need to have 70 percent of the population infected or vaccinated. So that means we could afford to have 30 percent of the people unvaccinated, and this would consist of the unsuitable candidates and those unwilling to give their informed consent. This scoring system can also serve as a guide to our implementing agencies in determining who should be prioritized for vaccination. The higher the score, the higher the priority. If, through this scoring system, one can see there’s a clear benefit versus harm score, then one doesn’t have to mentally struggle to weigh the pros and cons. It should also be explained that at the rate mutations of the virus is developing, there’s a big possibility that a yearly booster dose may be required. The government must already factor this in when calculating how many doses would be needed in the next two to three years. Those vaccinated this year may need another dose or two next year. The vaccine recipients will also have to set their minds that this is not a one-time, good-for-life vaccination. Just like the regular flu shots, annual booster doses most likely will be required. But, for our personal decision-making, let’s get our shots as soon as the vaccines become available, and that is if we’re suitable using the proposed vaccination scoring. Let’s worry about the need for booster doses next year. We still have 2021 to survive. In this pandemic, we just have to go one step at a time, but do it in a well-calculated, rational and decisive manner.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"He doesn’t believe in V-Day, I don’t believe in LDR, yet here we are",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/379171/he-doesnt-believe-in-v-day-i-dont-believe-in-ldr-yet-here-we-are/,"07:03 PM February 15, 2021","We have spent more time apart than together, and we wanted to change that—then the pandemic hit us “I don’t believe in Valentine’s Day,” Martin said, rather dismissively, a week before Feb. 14. “But you sent me flowers last year!” I said. Well, I also don’t believe in long-distance relationships (LDRs), yet here we are on a requisite video call. We met in Gothenburg, Sweden, almost four years ago during my monthlong Scandinavian sojourn, a cold and expensive but super worth it trip, since who knows when we can travel for fun again? Before Martin Karlsson and I became long-distance lovers, we were long-distance friends. I was pining over a Swedish DJ I met in Stockholm, and I would talk to Martin during the wee hours, since my sadness required an audience while my Filipino friends were asleep. He was my “night shift” sounding board, and we kept in touch since. Martin came to Manila in 2019 and we made our relationship official. Ours is a slow-cooked, acquired-taste kind of romance. A heartbroken friend once asked me the secret to finding love, and for me it’s two words: Tinder Gold. There was a gnawing anxiety to being single in my mid-30s, laughing at memes, while my former classmates are already on their second marriages and sending their kids to high school. I didn’t really vibe with my domestic dates, so I outsourced. Being a Southeast Asian girl on a holiday in Northern Europe meant being consistently “random checked” by airport security and swabbed for explosives, but my Tinder matches made up for that hassle. Being “exotic” was a plus, and I admit I got lucky. There are a lot of jerks and scammers on dating apps, just like in real life. Perhaps Martin’s pragmatic view of a day dedicated to love is grounded in our cultural and personal differences. He’s a straightforward lawyer and an introvert geek. I have been in media, which involves events and interactions. While my 20s had been a big hangover, Martin collected “models,” which are actually Medieval Warhammer figures, not lingerie angels. We have spent more time apart than together, and we wanted to change that—but then the pandemic hit us. Communication is literally all we have. Waiting out the lockdown alone in my apartment was scary, and my routine calls with Martin kept me afloat. We somehow have the same work schedule despite the time difference, and he would patiently listen to my woes, saving me from making a mess on socials. Nothing is too sad, kinky or silly.  He is my safe space (“Do you still call them Swedish meatballs or just meatballs?” “When you give me a foot rub, does that count as a Swedish massage?”), and I am his (“Why is there Christmas decor before Halloween?” “There’s rice and spaghetti in fast food?”). By now, he has learned a few Filipino words such as merienda and chika. He is more supportive than my best sports bra, but he does not coddle. Being with a practical lover means approaching things directly, almost in a businesslike manner. If we want something changed or done, we tell it as it is. We negotiate. There are no hints or silent treatment and you can’t be pabebe. That might be the reason Martin and I hardly argue. He only gets upset with my tardiness and the final seasons of “Game of Thrones.” But there are stuff that annoy me, like when he asked why I needed a visa, or when I realized that he pays less for utilities. He also told me that Swedish health care applies as well to immigrants, covers mental issues and maternity, and sets no cap on sick days. Their government provides a stipend to students and the jobless till they find work. Swedish parental leave is a generous 480 days per child, and it doesn’t matter if the kid is adopted. Empathy and art are taught in school—which is free all the way to university. I call his way of life “perpetual perks.” Maybe these privileges are also why being a Swedish resident is not as easy as marrying someone who is a citizen—in fact, it doesn’t matter if couples are married as long as stringent requirements are met. Despite my awful internet, Martin and I manage to go on virtual dates. On my recent birthday, I told him I found it odd that some greetings pinned the “happy” on being with a partner. It’s nice to be with someone, of course, but I am always for self-sustainability and celebrating the joy and survival of a person as an independent individual. Our partnership works because we respect each other’s moods and quirks. Love, I have learned, doesn’t have to be stressful. Sweden never locked down; meanwhile, I am still quarantined in the Philippines, spending another Valentine’s Day away from Martin. So I asked him, if he doesn’t believe in Valentine’s, why did he send me surprise roses the last time? “Because I believe in you!,” he said. “And you like Valentine’s. Do you have any Valentine wishes?” “I just want us to be together,” I said. “And maybe an Apple Watch, or an air fryer.”  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Writing the body pandemic,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/379150/writing-the-body-pandemic/,"06:47 PM February 15, 2021","What exactly is the role of creative writers amid the horror of COVID-19? Four books try to reveal the literary answer In the face of the world they know ending around them, what do storytellers do? Do they hide and simply survive? No, they write, but what to write? Do they turn to writing escapist tales? Or do they write about the world the way only they can? In the 14th century, the bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, was ravaging Europe. In Florence, the writer Giovanni Boccaccio wrote “Il Decameron” or “The Decameron,” a book about trying to survive the Black Death. This was the inspiration that triggered a most unusual project by the New York Times Magazine. It arose from novelist Rivka Galchen’s story pitch suggesting that the locked-down denizens of New York pick up “The Decameron” (which incidentally was already selling out at the time). The editors at the magazine then thought: Why not create a “Decameron” for the COVID-19 pandemic? The magazine came out on July 12, 2020, to a warm reception and critical acclaim, and that issue is now on bookstore shelves as “The Decameron Project: 29 New Stories from the Pandemic,” selected by editors of the New York Times Magazine (Scribner, New York, 2020, 300 pages, available in hardcover from Fully Booked and fullybookedonline.com). The 29 tales—lonely, befuddled, hopeful, despairing—include some translated from Portuguese and Hebrew, and range from the funny (Mia Cuoto’s “An Obliging Robber,” where a homeowner hilariously mistakes a health worker in personal protective equipment for a gentle invader) to the fearful (Liz Moore’s “Clinical Notes,” about a mother’s measurements of a child who is coming down with the illness). Standouts include Booker Prize winner Margaret Atwood’s “Impatient Griselda,” which is a first-alien account of a, well, alien who arrives on Earth in the middle of the quarantine, and “How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe” author Charles Yu’s story “Systems,” which is almost a prose-poem of human distraction, distress and priority. “The Decameron Project” is notable in that it is a creative writing project about the pandemic meant to be read to get people through the pandemic—indeed, a modern, modified take on the Italian original. They got it out so quickly that it fulfills its original and new purpose well. In the Philippines, journalists have been writing about COVID-19 from the start, and there are those who have said it would be insensitive to collect creative writing for anthologies while more than a thousand Filipinos are being infected every day.   Poet and scholar Gemino H. Abad notes, the “speaking for myself, the role of any writing is to speak truth! From one’s own reflection on his life experience. It cannot be ‘insensitive’ and it may always help one and others.” He goes on to say, “I wouldn’t know what a ‘new normal’ might mean for ‘creative writing.’ What will remain, I think, under any circumstances, is a commitment to truth.” The creative writer’s role then is to write the Filipino experience of the pandemic for Filipinos to read. National Artist for Literature Virgilio S. Almario was an early example of someone writing about the pandemic as he posted new poems on his Facebook pages (Virgilio Senadren Almario or Rio Alma) every day of the initial enhanced community quarantine, writing about mortality and front-liners. “May COVID ang buong burukrasya,” he said, noting that the strength came from the unsung heroes. “Ang mga papuri at oda ko sa mga front-liner at doktor na nasawi sa digmaang ito ay mula sa puso.” He intends to release the poems in a book eventually. In fact, e-books about the pandemic in the Philippines were released during the pandemic. The Cultural Center of the Philippines’ (CCP) Intertextual Division, with Philippine PEN, launched the anthology “In Certain Seasons: Mothers Write in the Time of Covid,” edited by Jenny Ortuoste and Che Sarigumba (download it for free via the CCP Facebook page; email [email protected]; tel. 0919-3175708) last month. The book was conceived by the CCP Intertextual Division’s Beverly Wico Sy. “Having read countless posts by mothers on Facebook throughout the lockdown, [Wico said] many were insightful and well written, as well as being immediate reactions to the pandemic and its ramifications at the time,” said Ortuoste, a journalist and teacher at the University of Santo Tomas. “We decided to make the project ‘open genre’ to be able to accommodate different creative forms that would make the collection more interesting and expressive of the artists’ emotional and mental states at the time. We tried our best to get a diversity of voices and backgrounds and made sure that the regions were represented.”  “In Certain Seasons” was finished rather efficiently, with the call for contributions out in early October and most of the contributions in by November. The final lineup is a powerful one: Nikki Alfar, Merlie Alunan, Alma Anonas-Carpio, Adelle Chu, Jhoanna Lynn Cruz, Neni Sta.

The experiences distilled in “In Certain Seasons” begin at giving birth, continue on to teaching at home, to cooking and starting a business, gardening, reflecting on relationships, caring for the ill, and facing the idea of growing old and facing death. Ortuoste said, “We have received requests for a print version, but we need sponsors to help shoulder the cost.” But the making of “In Certain Seasons” has been a proud and happy experience for her. “On a personal note, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, underwent double mastectomy surgery, and started chemotherapy throughout the months we were working on this. So this book will be memorable for me on many levels.” Ortuoste is a definite believer in the importance of creative writing during the pandemic: “The pandemic is a life-altering event that has shaken the world to its core. The more the people who are recording their take on an event, the wider and broader a range of perspectives we have on the matter, and creative writers are well poised to contribute their efforts, along with historians and journalists.” Aside from the diverse and excellent writing, “In Certain Seasons” is important because of what it represents: “Mothers were at the front lines of the pandemic, making the home run smoothly while everyone was at home for months during the lockdown. Yet their opinions and feelings are often overlooked and relegated to the background. This book brings at least some of that to the fore,” Ortuoste said.  The other literary anthology on COVID-19 that has already come out is attached to a broader project. The University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH), one of the major battlegrounds against the virus, initiated its Human Spirit Project. The project is an online archive that “documents the stories of the people who work in PGH since it became one of the country’s COVID-19 Referral Centers.” The PGH Human Spirit Project launched three free e-books, but the third book, “Pagninilay: Hinga, Hingal at Hingalo ng Panahon ng Pandemya,” edited by Doctors Joey A. Tabula, Alvin B. Caballes and Noel P. Pingoy, is a literary anthology (tinyurl.com/PGHHSPPagninilay or bit.ly/2WuZVIt). “The first book is about the PGH or the hospital response to the pandemic,” Dr. Tabula said. “The second book is about volunteerism… The third book… tells the stories of front-liners and nonfront-liners from hospitals outside of PGH and local communities. ‘Pagninilay’ is a mix of medical and nonmedical creative writers. It offers a holistic examination and perspective of the pandemic.” Dr. Tabula had been brought on board by Dr. Caballes, who headed the entire book project. The criteria was that the contributors needed to be from UP (“past and present, including fellows of UP creative writing workshops”) and the writing needed to be about the pandemic. The call for submissions went out in April 2020 and by June they had more than 100 contributions. The final lineup: Eric Abalajon, R.B. Abiva, Cesar G. Aljama, Mark Angeles, Jasmine Arcilla, Bryan Mari Argos, Joel F. Ariate Jr., Mark Joseph Z. Arisgado, Kristoffer B. Berse, Paul Alcoseba Castillo, Jeremy Cordero, Dakila Cutab, Sofia Angela Federico, Ralpha Fonte, Ferdinand Pisigan Jarin, Ronald Law, Wilfredo Liangco, Hansel B. Mapayo, Ma. Jhayle Anne Marie Z. Meer, Glenn Tek-ing Muñez, Jose Velando Ogatis-I, Jhio Jan A. Navarro, Hannah Paguila, Lourdes Dominique R. Panganiban, Honesto M. Pesimo Jr., Elvie Victonette B. Razon-Gonzalez, Danton Remoto, Dexter Reyes, Fermin Salvador, Kenneth Samala, Alvina Pauline D. Santiago, Cheeno Marlo Sayuno, Orland Agustin Solis, Victor N. Sugbo, Jose Monfred C. Sy, Genesy Timonera, Kristoffer Aaron G. Tiña, Lisa S. Trabaco, Eileen Villegas and Vincen Gregory Yu. The poems, stories and essays are well crafted and urgent. “I want readers to know or be reminded that the struggle during the pandemic is real and that they are not alone in it,” Dr. Tabula said. “Doctors and other professionals are with them. The book is subtitled ‘Hinga, Hingal, Hingalo.’ That basically is the description of our collective experience during the first few months of the pandemic, or even perhaps almost a year in the pandemic. The book encourages everyone to respond to this ‘Hinga, Hingal, Hingalo’ and assert from our government the good COVID-19 response that we Filipinos deserve.” An internist, Dr. Tabula is that rare physician-writer who has already published a book of medical anecdotes and a book of interviews with oncologists. “This is my advocacy, to bring the creative writing of doctors to the people,” he said. He is, in fact, one of the panelists for the upcoming Bienvenido N. Santos Creative Writing Center Creative Nonfiction Workshop for Doctors at De La Salle University later this year. Additionally, “Pagninilay” will be released in print some time in 2021. Expect then more writing and more books about the pandemic by Filipinos as the virus mutates and the quarantine drags on. In a sentiment that can be traced from “The Decameron” to “Pagninilay,” Dr. Tabula says, “Aside from chronicling the pandemic experience, creative writers offer new ways of looking and thinking about the pandemic. It also encourages reflection among the readers, to think deeply. And this reflective reading and thinking can offer new ways of responding to the pandemic. Creative writers have the capacity to heal the ills of the country.”  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
The rise of philanthropy during COVID,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/378727/the-rise-of-philanthropy-during-covid/,"05:21 PM February 08, 2021","‘It may seem like there’s no money around, but Filipinos are charitable,’ says Helen Ong, whose coffee-table book project for the Philippine Cancer Society has raised P8M During the lockdown, philanthropist Helen Ong thought of producing a coffee-table book on glamorous humanitarians as a fundraising project for indigent cancer patients. Friends shot down the idea, believing that people would hold on to their money as the future seemed uncertain. Unfazed, she convinced colleagues that helping cancer patients in this pandemic was more urgent than ever. Ong is chair of the Best Dressed Women of the Philippines (BDWP), the annual fundraising event for the Philippine Cancer Society (PCS), a nongovernmental organization that assists disadvantaged cancer patients. Due to pandemic restrictions, the traditional gala fashion show was scrapped. The 220-page book, “Best Dressed Women of the Philippines 2020,” became the viable alternative. Since its launch in December, the book has racked up some P8 million from sponsorships, donations and sales. Seven hundred hardbound copies are nearly sold out despite the P3,000 price. Written by former magazine editor Josemari Ugarte and designed by Evangeline Franco, the book is like a portfolio of the country’s social registry, highlighting important people who have helped the PCS over the years. Ong, who is also Consul of Angola, has been a volunteer for the PCS. In 2004, the PCS asked if she could organize a ball for charity. The business-savvy envoy suggested that a fashion show featuring stylish and charitable women would generate more income. In 2004, Ong established the BDWP and had it registered at the Bureau of Trademark and Intellectual Property of the Philippines. She approached such grand dames as Imelda Cojuangco and Consuelo Madrigal Collantes, fashion designer Jose “Pitoy” Moreno and interior designer Gerry Contreras to lend prestige to the project. Monaco Consul Fortune Ledesma later joined the group. At the start, BDWP gathered women from socially prominent families. The first batch of BDWP included the likes of Maria Cristina Zobel, Susana Madrigal, Gina Lopez, Victoria Zubiri and Therese Coronel Santos, to name a few. Then came Cristina Ponce Enrile, Marilou Peña Koa, Susie Madrigal Bayot, Mercedes Lopez Vargas, Menchu Menchaca Soriano, et al. These BDWP made generous contributions that were tax deductible. A donation of P150,000 was equivalent to a table for 10. Some would get four tables. Gretchen Oppen Cojuangco (BDWP 2005) always wrote a seven-figure check, as did the late BDWP honorary chair Meldy Cojuangco. Over time, the BDWP list embraced the new guard—self-made entrepreneurs, doctors and executives. Ong’s committee draws up a list of nominees for the BDWP. Some women aspiring for gravitas have hinted that they would like to be on that list. She would cite the BDWP committee and former BDWP as the decision makers in the final selection. Many have been rejected for not meeting the criteria. The bottom line is that BDWP should be achievers with a heart for humanity, says Ong. The latter batches of BDWP underwent training in deportment and social graces, since they were ambassadors for the BDWP brand. BDWP‘s sterling reputation had helped propel women into the spotlight, such as socialite Agile Zamora; Connie Haw, president and CEO of Advance Paper Group of Companies; and Myrna Yao, president and CEO of Richwell Trading, distributor of Barbie dolls. Ong says that although the gala dinner would raise an average of P14 million, a huge chunk went to the fashion logistics. Book production was more cost-efficient. For the cover, the committee chose women for their enduring support and their panache. Philanthropist Alice Eduardo, CEO of Sta. Elena Construction and Development Corp., landed on the front, wearing a purple beaded Pamela Anderson gown. On the back, dancer Michaela “Pinky” Puno’s yellow origami gown by Oliver Tolentino grabbed attention. Puno told Lifestyle she could relate to the cause since her daughter, sister-in-law and friend are afflicted with cancer. “Many people who cannot afford treatment turn to the PCS for help. Helen Ong is admirable for spearheading this.” The 2020 list included fa miliar faces in the social circle such as civic leader Mache Ackerman, political wife Beging Soriano and Prescy Yulo, CEO of the country’s top aesthetics and health-care products distribution company. Ong notes that this batch includes hard workers who have kept a low profile. Sans makeup in her photographs, Isabelita “Eisa” Mercado projects an unassuming air as chair and CEO of four companies with a total workforce of 6,500. Moreover, she was last year’s recipient of Asia CEO Awards and the Circle of Excellence BizNews Asia award. Looking resplendent in a silk magenta gown by Davao designer Aris Escarilla, Dr. Maria Lourdes “Malou” Monteverde is influential in Mindanao. Photographed in frou-frou outfits, Shirley Sobremonte is chair and president of a realty firm and two industrial companies. Men of Exemplary Influence—prominent gentlemen who support PCS’s cause—were introduced in 2011. The first batch included former President Fidel Ramos, industrialist Ramon Ang and urban planner Felino Palafox Jr. The 2020 batch includes a variety—Sen. Juan Edgardo Angara, Cebu furniture designer Vito Selma, Jaime Ponce de Leon of Leon Gallery, banker Cecilio San Pedro, San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora, et al. During the virtual book launch, former envoy to China Ambassador Francis Chua accepted the 2020 Most Influential Man of the Philippines award. As the founder of B.A. Securities, one of BDWP’s longtime supporters, he said his influence wasn’t because he is former president of several chambers of commerce or his powerful network. “My influence, if any, must come from working with philanthropists like you to reach people with poor lives.” Ong credits the success of the project amid the recession to friends who have supported BDWP over the years. Sculptor Ramon Orlina donated a sculpture which would be auctioned with a ceiling price of half a million pesos. Instead of an auction last year, Orlina’s recent art was purchased for P450,000 and donated to PCS. San Miguel Corp., Pagcor, Hermès and celebrity doctor Aivee Teo have consistently written six-figure checks. Ong’s business, Czarina Foreign Exchange, has likewise been helping from the start. “I don’t hold the money. Everything goes to the PCS, including the expense report of the book production,” Ong maintains. As of this writing, Ong is still mulling over a project for BDWP 2021. Asked what has motivated her to serve for 17 years, she replies that her husband, Dr. Luciano Ong, died of thyroid cancer. As a volunteer to PCS, she recalls visiting the charity wards where patients asked for leftover toilet paper. She witnessed how the poor wept when they could not pay for their medical bills. In the early months of the quarantine, hospitals could not accommodate new cancer patients since they were burdened with COVID patients. The patients and their relatives had no money for transportation and food. Ong says the PCS made provisions for those cases. However, there were instances when the PCS ran out of funds to pay for the medicines. Ong is optimistic that the BDWP committee will pull off the fundraising yet again as the times become more challenging. “It may seem like there’s no money around, but Filipinos are charitable,” she says. —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
Here’s Where to Find Love… or Something Like It,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/378539/heres-where-to-find-love-or-something-like-it/,"06:15 PM February 04, 2021","As Valentine’s Day draws near, many have also been sharing their sentiments about the possibility of finding “The One” in time for Hearts Day. Would you believe even a potential date on Valentine’s Day, #NasaLazadaYan? For Jhasin Benito, her frequent orders on Lazada led to a romance that blossomed with her “Kuya Lazada” courier Marlon Cajucom. “Nakilala ko si Jhasin dahil ako yung nagdedeliver ng mga parcel sa lugar nila. Naka-usap ko yung nanay niya ng isang beses kong mag-deliver at pinakitahan ako ng picture niya. Pagkatapos nun ay umasa ako na may mga delivery ako sa kanila, nagtatanong pa ako kung anong pangalan ng customer kahit na alam ko kung sino siya para lang makita ko siya palagi,” says Marlon.  Sparks flew after deliveries led to conversations, and Marlon and Jhasin eventually tied the knot, and are now expecting their first child! As they celebrate their first Valentine’s Day together as a married couple, Marlon shares that he wants to continue treating Jhasin like the queen she is to him. “Salamat po sa trabaho ko na to at di ko akalain na makikita ko na pala ang taong matagal ko nang hinahanap at pinagdarasal. Ngayon po ay gusto kong bigyan si Jhasin ng special na regalo sa Valentine’s Day, para maipakita ko ang appreciation ko sa kanya,” says Marlon. We’re all wishing #SanaAll to Marlon and Jhasin’s story, and hope that he will find the perfect Valentine’s Day gift for her! Finding gifts for significant others, friends and family really doesn’t have to be difficult – you don’t have to look far, because #NasaLazadaYan.   Flowers have always been associated with emotion of love, joy, affection, and romance.

If there’s something we all need to have at least once a week, it’s a breather. It’s always a good idea to take a moment to pause and relax from the hustle and bustle of the world. This is a gentle reminder to treat yourself occassionally, such as by to a spa or self-care date at home. Valentine’s day is not only about giving love to others, but also a perfect time to shower yourself with some love and appreciation. So take a relaxing bath, listen to some of your favorite tunes, and light a scented candle to give yourself a special treat!  This year, we continue to adjust to a new lifestyle brought about by the pandemic. We had to abruptly put on pause many little things we were all accustomed to, such as gatherings with friends, traveling, and most importantly, hugs. This year, we have to refrain from sharing hugs and kisses as we celebrate the day of love, but at least this weighted blanket has us covered (literally). Studies have shown that weighted blankets offer a ton of benefits – such as calming a restless body, reducing feelings of anxiety and stress, and improving sleep. This is perfect to cap off a long day of working or studying at home, to ensure you get a good night’s rest.  As good as it might be to “live in the moment,” there are occasions where we can’t help but feel the need to immortalize experiences and life events in pictures, so we have something to look back to and re-live those special memories. With trends from the 90s and early 2000’s circling back, the Kodak M35 Non-disposable Camera also lends a certain aesthetic film effect when capturing unforgettable moments.  The surge of plantitos and plantitas rose during the onset of quarantine, and it seems like there is no stopping the green-thumb community from extending their roots to every Filipino home. It is said that owning indoor plants can provide several health benefits, such as enhancing one’s mood, increasing creativity and reducing stress. These Nordic Ceramic Vase are a great option to enhance your room aesthetic while housing your favorite indoor plants!

How discerning are you about ‘plant-based’ food?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/378460/how-discerning-are-you-about-plant-based-food/,"04:10 PM February 03, 2021","Demand is soaring. But next-generation faux meats are mostly highly processed food that mimic almost to perfection the real deal—some even ‘bleed’ like your typical beef burger Not all plant-based foods are made equal. The pandemic had people cruising down refrigerated grocery aisles in search of meat alternatives. But just because a food is labeled vegan or vegetarian doesn’t necessarily mean it is healthy. It’s easy to see why companies are cashing in on the plant-based food trend. A report in Eco-Business said that since the lockdown, plant-based meat sales in the United States jumped 261 percent, while in Europe, 39 percent of global sales accounted for meat substitutes. Plant-based manufacturing companies are now keenly observing the new frontier: Asia. Just recently, the Singapore Food Agency approved sales of Eat Just “chicken” nuggets, becoming the first country to approve lab-grown chicken nuggets. We now have Impossible Food products (Burger King’s plant-based patty is manufactured by Impossible Food), Beyond Meat, OmniMeat. The demand for plant-based food is soaring, but is the market, comprised of people who earnestly want to shift to a healthier lifestyle, discerning enough? The next-generation faux meats are mostly highly processed food that mimic almost to perfection the real deal in texture, mouthfeel, smell and look—some even “bleed” like your typical beef burger. For example, nutritionally, the difference between Burger King’s plant-based burger and real meat is not that big. Bur­ger King’s Plant-Based Whopper (marketed as Impossible Whopper in the United States) is loaded with 630 calories compared to the real deal at 660 calories; Plant-Based Whopper packs 1,080 mg sodium while the regu­lar Whopper has 980 mg; saturated fat is 34 g while the regular Whopper has 40 g. Checking the ingredients is prudent practice. Make it a habit to flip over the box. Check the sugar, protein source, saturated fat. Does it contain recognizable whole-food ingredients, or does it list a series of unpronounceable stuff? In the Philippines, Naked Foods, the new kid on the block, is fast gaining followers among woke consumers. Since lockdown, demand for its plant-based products skyrocketed by 60 percent, its founder Cinty Yñiguez told Inquirer Lifestyle. Naked Foods is a family-­owned business on a mission “to nourish people with healthy, plant-based alternatives that are stripped of preservatives.” Handcrafted in Makati and distributed nationwide, it aims to make healthy choices simpler and easier. Options range from Filipino and Italian sausages, to bacon, and even butter. Yñiguez is a certified yoga instructor, clinical nutritionist, health and wellness advocate, who will soon complete her Vegan Nutrition Health Coach certification. “We’re constantly exploring and evolving to find better ways, not necessarily the best, but at least better ways to keep ourselves healthy, to nourish ourselves physically, mentally, emotionally, even spiritually. And so we’re always looking for that healthy, safe, sustainable path that’s always going to heal us,” Yñiguez said. Naked Foods aims to provide people a healthy, sustainable lifestyle, and that means supplying the market with nutritious and tasty plant-based foods. What started in Hong Kong with making green juices and five plant beds grew into a passion for spreading love. Yñiguez recalls distributing tumblers of green juices to friends so they would know green juice didn’t taste offensive. Her passion for cooking and experimenting with ingredients made her vegan journey enjoyable. When she relocated to Manila, she connected with local farmers to make healthy plant-based food made of fresh and whole ingredients. “Whenever I source the ingredients, I ensure that they’re non-GMO (genetically modified organism). I really source carefully. I’m conscious about the trans fat and, of course, no whites. I don’t use anything white—white sugar, white flour, white rice, white pasta, white fat from meat. White fat from meat products is different from what you actually get from vegetables,” she said. Sweeteners are natural, like brown sugar or maple syrup; nutritional yeast instead of cheese. No milk and milk products. Just clean, pure, vegan food choices. She also believes going vegan need not be expensive. “There are plant-based products in the market that are expensive, especially those imported from overseas. That’s why it’s good to have a local alternative that makes the prices accessible, and that will also give you the same amount of nutrients, sometimes even better,” Yñiguez said. How much better is Naked Foods? For starters, Yñiguez said she is particular about the sodium content, even in her home. She doesn’t buy table salt. “There’s a huge difference when you take table salt, and you compare that with one piece of rock salt. You’ll feel it instantly, you’ll feel the unhealthiness of the table salt. Sea salt is very light, and it makes a huge difference in the dishes that you prepare, whether it’s for commercial or for personal use,” she said. Yñiguez also replaced regular soy sauce with coconut aminos. There are healthier replacements for most ingredients, she said; one needs to find them. Another plus with locally produced plant-based foods, she said, is being able to make products suited to the Filipino palate. Naked Foods’ Filipino Sausage, for instance, is mildly sweet. Made of mushrooms, garlic, onions, tomato paste, olive oil, sunflower oil, and more, a serving has only 330 calories. She keeps the Filipino sweet tooth in mind but is mindful not to go overboard with the sugar. That way, Filipinos can still satisfy their cravings for familiar food without sacrificing the nutrition. Sweet Pork is Naked Foods’ version of tocino. “All products have no preservatives; that’s why those that are not frozen have a shorter shelf life,” she said. Her personal favorite and popular among buyers is the Smoky Maple Bacon with an umami flavor. Also available are plant-based Beyond Butter in salted, unsalted and garlic truffle in 140-g tubs; Vegetable Bouillon Powder; Beef Strips; Char Siu; Sweet Pork Bites; Pulled Pork; Sweet-Glazed Bacon; Dark Choco Chip Edible Cookie Dough; and Dark Choco Mint Edible Cookie Dough. “For me, it’s about replacing meat when I create the products. It’s an alternative, giving people an option. You know, which one works well for them, which one resonates with them, which one is going to make them feel at their best ultimately,” she said. —CONTRIBUTED Naked Foods is available at Naked Foods By Cinty on Facebook or @nakedfoodsbycinty on Instagram, Real Food PH, Molito, Alabang @realfoodph, Real Food PH, BGC, The Vegan Grocer @thevegangrocerph.

Time to release the brakes,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/377728/time-to-release-the-brakes/,"10:40 PM January 19, 2021","As we focus on the task of recovery, we must grow back better for the people and the planet Before the New Year, I found myself walking across a web of rope suspended high above sea level. Underneath me pointed the jagged peaks of a limestone rock. There was no handrail to hold on to, so I took my first steps cautiously and not without some trepidation, even though I have crossed this path before and knew that hundreds more thereafter have crossed this very same rope bridge in complete safety. I knew I would get to my destination—the center of the spider web with a spectacular view of the forests of Masungi Georeserve—but I still entered slowly, trying not to bounce around an already precarious situation. This is how I feel as we usher in 2021, a year that everyone hoped and prayed would be better than the unprecedented catastrophe that was 2020. In many ways, it already is. Domestic travel has restarted in several destinations that the Department of Tourism (DOT) has helped reopen in concurrence with the local governments and in compliance with health and safety protocols. Over the holidays, Boracay welcomed a fair number of visitors, who were thrilled to have pristine swathes of beach to themselves. This sustainable vision of the island is what landed Boracay on the No. 2 spot of Condé Nast Traveler’s “25 Best Island Beaches in the World” as voted by readers (El Nido came in at No. 9). We can bank on the goodwill and love that foreigners have for our islands to last until international travel resumes once more. On the other hand, we are also staring at the imminent appearance of a new variant of the coronavirus. The government’s swift decision to ban travelers or impose strict 14-day quarantines for arriving passengers from the affected countries will contribute to containing the new variant’s transmission. We are in effect experiencing version 2.0 of 2020, but now armed with more experience, more science and the promise of vaccines. Developing and promoting domestic tourism will continue to be the main strategy we pursue this year. In light of the new COVID variant, entry protocols, quarantine regulations and contact tracing procedures need to be strengthened. The DOT will prioritize the issuance of health and safety guidelines for the operations of other tourism enterprises and activities to ensure the well-being of visitors and workers as well as help improve the readiness of destinations to reopen for business. We have also begun product diversification and enhancement activities, working with various local government units (LGUs) to recalibrate existing products or develop new offerings. For instance, the hiking trails of Mt. Gulugud Baboy in Mabini, Batangas, can be expanded on to create more nondiving attractions in Anilao for families, nondivers and divers seeking alternative activities. In Zambales, we are looking to develop and market the area of Botolan, which has been identified as a site rich in potential for water sports, wellness, nature and adventure tourism. Sohoton Caves and Natural Bridge in Basey, Samar, have undergone preparations, being the first show cave in the country. Villaconzoilo Farm in Jaro, Leyte, also offers new, hands-on farm activities that will delight and impart knowledge to its visitors. We are also enhancing Bukidnon’s mountain and farming activities, such as in Tagoloan River Valley, Lawis Ridge and Taglucop Strawberry Hills, and will position the province as a nature corridor linking the western and eastern parts of Mindanao. Most destinations require the submission of a negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result within 48-72 hours of travel; to encourage more people to travel, we partnered with the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) and Philippine Children’s Medical Center (PCMC) to subsidize 50 percent of RT-PCR costs for tourists. Local travelers can avail of the discounted RT-PCR tests at UP-PGH for P900 and at PCMC for only P750. In addition to lowering testing costs, we will also see to it that the protocols surrounding domestic travel are streamlined. The widely differing entry requirements from the LGUs, the multiple contact tracing apps that need to be downloaded and the limited travel options available to tourists have been overwhelming. This year, expect guidelines to be more unified and protocols to be standardized as destinations and their LGUs and private stakeholders identify best practices and learn from those that have already reopened. The concept of tourism has fundamentally changed over the last year, and the DOT has shifted its goals accordingly. The pandemic has truly unearthed the human side of the tourism industry, and its losses were felt widely and deeply. Our measure of success shouldn’t be based solely on revenue and visitor arrivals, but should also reflect how many jobs have been created, how many sustainable tourism products were developed, and how, through tourism, we are preserving and celebrating Filipino values and culture. As we focus on the task of recovery, we must grow back better for the people and the planet. In a global campaign with CNN to #RestartTourism, the United Nations World Trade Organization declared that “Movement defines us. Standing still is not an option.” Humans have an inexorable drive to keep going forward, to explore and to conquer. But I will add that there is also a time to stand still. The world stood still for many months in 2020, rendered immobile by the need to stay home and stay safe, sometimes paralyzed by fear. We took a long pause, reassessing the world we have built and reckoning with the consequences. Now, it is time to release the brakes. —CONTRIBUTED INQ The author is the Secretary of Tourism.

"Digital fitness, lunchtime workouts to dominate 2021",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/377378/digital-fitness-lunchtime-workouts-to-dominate-2021/,"10:52 PM January 12, 2021","More and more people seek to combine physical training with mental repose The fitness industry has changed dramatically during the pandemic, altering our overall exercise experience. This 2021, experts see the industry tapping more into tech and a growing consumer demand for personalization and freedom, and a significant rise in virtual fitness. People’s fitness motivations come from a variety of reasons, whether it’s a desire for long-term health, an interest in the latest tech, or a general passion for all things wellness. It just makes perfect sense to reset and restore our motivation with these exciting trends that are anticipated to define fitness in 2021. Prior to the lockdown, many clubs had begun to test the viability of virtual fitness by developing mobile apps with on-demand libraries of workouts and implementing remote coaching. But as 95 percent of studios and gyms around the world closed their physical spaces, the need for online alternatives accelerated and brought digital fitness to an all-time high. The team at ClassPass recently conducted a wellness index study and reported that 81 percent of their members worked out using digital options, with yoga emerging on top. As people called for ways to combat pandemic stress, yoga increased in popularity by 25 percent, followed by high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and Pilates. Restorative fitness, meditation and stretching also rank in the Top 10 on-demand activities booked by members around the world. COVID-19 restrictions have encouraged gyms and trainers to expand their online presence to encourage more people to train no matter where they are or what the time is. People who were chained to their desks now find the need to step away and get active. In fact, for the first time ever, 12 p.m. is the most favored time to exercise, with lunchtime workouts seeing a 67-percent increase in popularity. HIIT ranked second in trends this year, according to American College of Sports Medicine’s Health and Fitness Journal, and it’s poised to remain one of the top fitness trends in 2021. HIIT exercises usually take significantly less time compared to regular ones, making them attractive to busy people or even those at home. The trend toward topics such as yoga, mental training or Pilates already existed before the coronavirus but was intensified by the pandemic, says ISPO.com. The desire is triggered not only by job-related stress, but also by the strenuous home schooling or financial and health fears in connection with the lockdown. As more and more people seek to combine physical training with mental repose, practices such as progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness-based stress reduction and meditation are predicted to become mainstays over the next few weeks and well into 2021. Of the respondents, 92 percent hope they can return to studios and gyms in 2021. The study also revealed that when gyms started reopening late last year, two underperforming genres during the lockdown had climbed back to the top: indoor cycling and reformer Pilates, where bookings have increased by 30 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Experts suggest that many fitness enthusiasts will continue to consume digital workouts, but rely on studio classes for the workouts that are tough to do at home. Safety information is also a key factor in the decision to return to gyms. At Anytime Fitness, members are updated about sanitation efforts and session guidelines. Members are also encouraged to use the new Anytime Fitness App so they can keep their fitness goals in check anytime, anywhere. Getting back into the swing of things postpandemic is also something to watch out for in the coming year. As our bodies reacclimate to being mobile again, recovery is something that can be integrated throughout an entire workout or activity. Warming up, activating your body and adding a recovery routine play a vital role in health and wellness management. Our renewed focus and increasing need for health and wellness ultimately means that the industry, although riddled with a lot of changes, is essential not just this 2021 but in the coming years ahead. —CONTRIBUTED INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2021
"Why I won’t shush my kid for saying, ‘Don’t eat animals’",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/377157/why-i-wont-shush-my-kid-for-saying-dont-eat-animals/,"02:46 PM January 06, 2021","Kids refuse to eat chicken nuggets once they learn that animals are being served as food. Yet, adults insist on doing ‘baby steps’ in eating less meat A dear relative, whom I love and respect with all my heart, advised me to train my 5-year-old not to call out people on eating animals. He brought up one occasion when family offered my daughter some chicken and she declined, saying, “You should not eat animals!” I said I wouldn’t shut her up because she was speaking the truth. YouTube is awash with vids of kids refusing to eat chicken nuggets once they’ve made the connection that animals were being served as food. Yet, adults insist on doing “baby steps” in their “personal journey” to eating less meat. “But she will be hated!” he argued. “It’s being holier-than-thou, like overbearing preachers of religion. She will turn people off!” “She may,” I agreed. “But some will reflect on that truth.” Some will be put off, but there will be those who will shed their egos and open their hearts and minds to reality. Because there is no time. The relative talked about how COVID-19 may have come from a lab, and I said that while highly unlikely, even if it did, it’s indisputable that all other pandemics and coronaviruses have come from forcing animals to be in places they didn’t want to be in. He talked about (US) Democrats and Republicans and how he doesn’t believe the world would end by 2050. I said coronaviruses and climate change don’t care about political affiliations and aren’t partisan like religion and that whether or not the world would end by 2050 is up to us, really. “Look at us now,” I said. “We are talking in masks!” It didn’t matter what we believed in. What mattered is what we ate. Scientists did predict COVID-19 would come but even they admit that politicians wouldn’t have listened to them anyway because “highly likely pandemics” just aren’t top-of-the-list enough. Prepping for something not 100-percent sure is just not urgent or important enough. Too alarmist. While we’re still myopic about getting our hands on the vaccine for COVID-19, what are we doing to protect or prepare ourselves for the next pandemics to come? Are we really just going to keep relying on vaccines or can we finally give prevention a real try? By prevention, I mean stop breeding animals for consumption, or to sell as pets, or to test stuff on. Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg turned a lot of people off. Yet, a lot of politicians also wanted to hitch their bandwagons on to her. But she has famously refused to work with people who were not “radical enough.” One could easily allude that to youthful arrogance, but many also admire her for doing the right thing. Adults have to hem and haw and think about how any decision or stand they take would impact others’ view of them. While some criticize her for being “just an angry vegan,” she inspired others to do something about climate change, starting with what we put on our plates. I admit it took me a while to make the shift, despite all the books, articles, summits and documentaries I’ve consumed. Meanwhile, all it took for my brother JC was watching “The Game Changers,” and he turned vegan overnight. People have different reasons for going vegan: for health, the planet or the animals. But ultimately, we realize it’s all interconnected; that veganism isn’t an avoidance of calories or a mere diet but an avoidance of violence. What did you do when you learned the truth about eating animals? About the systemic oppression and murder of innocent beings? Did you take a stand for them or did you just shrug and say “it is what it is?” Once you know, you can no longer unsee. What you decide to do next is crucial: Do you continue to eat them, wear them, use them? Looking the other way is a decision, too. I realized I couldn’t swallow someone’s suffering and enjoy it any longer. So I will not silence my daughter. Silencing the truth would be destroying her character and standing with the abuse and oppression of beings entrusted to us. Telling her to “just be silent” is how you allow Harvey Weinsteins to exist and even thrive. It’s tantamount to saying it’s OK to let the powerful take advantage of you, or to prize being socially comfortable over being socially responsible. Neither will I censor my 10-year-old son. He finds every chance he gets in his subjects, whether building a character in Language, modeling environmental responsibility in Science, or showing examples of compassion in Christian Living, to talk about why we should not eat animals or to choose to be cruelty-free. I want to encourage their bravery, to take a stand now, than teach them to “just be easy, eat anything.” Yes, there are less uncomfortable ways to make people stop using animals, but my kids will find their footing. They will know what works. If we do fail, and the world does get worse, when my children ask me what I did about it, I can look them in the eye and say I used whatever platform I had, every encounter with someone, every morsel I ate or shared with others since I found out the truth about eating animals. I did not shove it down throats from a moral high ground; I screamed it out to anyone who cared to listen. If we want to heal as one, we have to start with what we eat.

The importance of a positive mindset,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/377136/the-importance-of-a-positive-mindset/,"02:26 PM January 06, 2021","(Last of two parts) As we usher in the new year, I remember Mang Sandro, whom we met while vacationing in Boracay more than 10 years ago. He was nearly 90 years old when we met him but he looked easily 10 years younger. He still had the spring in his step as he walked from one end of the beach to the other, selling knickknacks and cheap trinkets, neatly arranged in a small box-like container strapped to his shoulders. He looked very healthy for his age, but obviously he was not materially blessed. What was clear, though, was that he was full of joy and zest for life. He regaled the small crowd of people who gathered around him with tales of his small victories in life. We ended up buying some of the stuff he was selling. His wife had long passed away, but he was enjoying a wonderful relationship with his children and grandchildren, and tried to contribute his share to buy food and pay for their house rental and utilities. Mang Sandro was healthy physically, mentally and spiritually. He was profusely grateful for these and whatever blessings he had. He said he spent the first several minutes after waking up each day thanking God for blessing him with another day to live. He made no long-term plans. He just planned what to do each day, trusting that God would provide for all his needs, and those of his family. He took time and made an effort to thank God for each small blessing that he received. That epiphany is the same as what a foreign octogenarian had when he was shown the bill for his monthslong hospital stay after being treated successfully for critical COVID-19 complications. He was on high-flow oxygen therapy, and the oxygen alone amounted to tens of thousands of dollars. He cried profusely, and when asked if it was due to his huge hospital bill, he replied, “No, it’s definitely not that. The hospital deserves to be paid that amount of money for the life-saving air and oxygen it provided me. But what I just realized was that God has been providing me with free air and oxygen for more than 80 years, and I never thanked him for it.” Truly blessed are the grateful even for small things, because they will likely get much bigger blessings. Although Mang Sandro barely finished elementary education, many lettered and accomplished professionals could learn from his grateful and positive mindset. Despite his scarce means, he could be considered more blessed than many people of much greater affluence and material possessions. He had not, and would never, beg for alms. He didn’t even accept the tips his delighted customers would give him. He only got what he deserved to get for the goods he sold. He frowned at corrupt politicians who had no qualms about stealing people’s money. He plied his trade wherever his feet would take him, and his earnings were enough to provide for his food and shelter. He could not ask for more. With the little he had, he still had spare coins to share with the little boys and girls who made sandcastles along the beach, so they could buy supplies for their schooling. That was a sterling example of stewardship—sharing what we have with others. It’s not that Mang Sandro could freely spare the money, as he actually needed every peso he could save, but he felt others needed the loose change more than he did. It’s humbling that men like Mang Sandro could teach us such lessons. Mang Sandro was happy with what he had, and his happiness and contentment brought him priceless dividends. He had never been sick, or had a need to see a doctor. He never had a sleepless night, and never had to worry about enemies after his neck, or robbers after his possessions. The importance of a positive mindset, as happy and healthy people like Mang Sandro would teach us, could not be exaggerated. If we fill our minds with negative thoughts day in and day out, the outcomes would likely be negative. We get sickness, failure, broken relationships and financial ruin. Negative thoughts can only attract negative things; they’re not capable of attracting positive outcomes. The middle-aged nurse daughter of a patient of ours working in Europe just died recently from COVID-19 complications. Her mother would tell us that she was a health buff, and extremely careful about catching the virus. The precautionary measures she took were bordering on paranoia, such that she would not allow anyone to be within a meter of her at home or at work. Her fear of COVID-19 dominated her thoughts, and that probably attracted the infection more. The reverse happens if we constantly fill our minds with positive thoughts and feelings like good health, abundance, love, compassion, gratefulness, and a desire to help and share. We’ll likely get more of these in return. I know it’s easier said than done, but the truth is, our thoughts ultimately determine what kind of health, relationships and state of life we have from hereon. And if we badly need some changes in the life we have, we just have to make an effort to change our mindset. Around five years ago, when we vacationed again in Boracay, the familiar figure of Mang Sandro with his box of trinkets was no longer there. We were told that he died a couple of years ago, probably due to old age. We wished he was still there to regale us with his stories, and tell us more of his secrets to a happy and meaningful life. May the spirit of Mang Sandro’s cheerful and grateful heart fill our hearts, too, as we usher in the new year.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER. Prove your humanity",2021
Books for the 12 days of Christmas,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/376861/books-for-the-12-days-of-christmas/,"11:38 PM December 29, 2020","If the publishing industry seemed to be in the doldrums for much of 2020, the harvest of books published paints an optimistic picture I know many of us have lamented the nonessential status books and publishing have in the priorities of the government, made more evident in the early months of the lockdown, when existing disparities and inequality truly surfaced. It is always argued that in a country where the larger segment of the population does not have the basic needs for a respectable and decent life, how can one talk about promoting books and literacy? But why not feed both body and mind? It behooves those of us who have been privileged to complete an education that has given us a lifelong curiosity and desire to learn, to share this empowering gift with the rest of the population. If the publishing industry seemed to be in the doldrums for much of 2020, the harvest of books which have been published paints an optimistic picture. Bravo to these authors, illustrators, publishers for keeping at their craft, no matter what. It is a special Christmas gift and blessing for the 12 days of Christmas. No, I am not late for that because historically, the 12 days did not refer to the days before Christmas, but the days following it, ending on Jan. 6, the Epiphany or the day of the Three Kings. So, on the first day of Christmas, I am happy and astounded to have an array of books, a mix of titles for all ages and persuasions, to be lost in. May your 12 days be as fortunate, as magical. “The Age of Umbrage” by Jessica Zafra (Bughaw/Ateneo de Manila University Press). A much-awaited debut novel of popular writer Zafra, it has 15-year-old Guadalupe growing up confused, living in the servants’ quarters with her mother, the family cook in the house of one of the most affluent families in the world. She should be comfortable enough but lives a difficult life as she is misunderstood. She herself questions what her real life is. Close to the book’s end, it reads, “Her fears closed in like a shroud, winding tighter and tighter around her. She was a speck in a vast, endlessly spinning world which was mostly empty space anyway…” “Bahay Kubo: A Filipino Children’s Song” by Stephen Acabado, Kristian Sendon Cordero and Aldrin Camacho, illustrated by Camacho and Mavreen Anne E. Romero (Savage Mind Publishing House) goes beyond all expectations. The artwork is dramatic and haunting. This slim book reads beyond the lyrics of the song we all know, with the accompanying essays delving into anthropology and linguistics. Seriously! The vegetables in the song point to borrowed names and foreign connections from the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade. “By Their Deeds: The Paternos of the Spanish Era Vols. 1 & 2” by Jean Marie Yap Paterno and Miguel Roces Paterno (Reyes Publishing). This is a monumental family legacy project of two coffee table-size books which trace the origin and growth of a clan that began with the Chinese migrant Ming Mong Lo trying his luck in Las Yslas Filipinas. Its handsomely designed two volumes trace three generations of Paternos. It is a rich trove of primary sources which were fortunately spared the ravages of war—an inspiration for this project and the desire to honor the efforts and contributions of Paterno ancestors. “Cely’s Crocodile: The Art and Story of Araceli Limcaco Dans” by Gabriela Dans Lee, illustrated by Adrian Panadero (Tahanan Books for Young Readers) allows the readers to journey with the artist from childhood to her early years as an artist earning enough to help with family bills and put herself through school. It is a graceful and elegant biography that captures the essence of the artist and her art. From the day she was awed by the beauty of the crocodile her father had placed in their swimming pool, she began to see and appreciate the beauty around her: intricate lace shawls, gumamela in the garden, the face of a GI soldier after the war. This story was the 2019 Philippine Board on Books for Young People-Salanga winner. “Lies All Lies” by Marguerite Alcazaren de Leon is a collection of 11 self-published stories which follows her first book, “People in Panic.” Her short introduction gives valuable advice to the young writer. This, she says, is “a collection I wouldn’t have been able to write when I was younger, which really proved to me that you can’t rush your work, that you need to let yourself breathe and live through years of good and bad, and that you shouldn’t feel hounded by other people’s expectations…” “Maging Ligtas sa Coronavirus” by Eugene Y. Evasco, illustrated by Pergy Acuña (Lampara Publishing House Inc.) may be considered truly representative of 2020, as it discusses valuable information for children about this unseen mysterious and vicious virus that scientists are just beginning to know better. The complex topic has been simplified in bite-size sections for easy and painless reading. It is a welcome and playful touch to have the illustrations done in colorful cutouts. Oh, if only our textbooks were similarly attractive and engaging. “Sakto Lang (Just Enough)” by Joshene Bersales, illustrated by Domz Agsaway (OMF Literature Inc.) is an excellent example of a successful story written tightly, with just the right number of words. It is a familiar scenario in Philippine homes as a school year begins with the mother telling her two children she only has enough money for a school bag, a notebook, a pair of shoes. Kuya and Bunso sound natural as they try to make the situation easier by taking only what each one needs. A funny dilemma is, a pair of shoes for these insect characters with six feet? An expected pat ending is the family hugging and kissing. The insects render a playful tone and so does the final line, and they tickled their mother. This is part of the Room to Read collection of 20 titles. “School is Life: Progressive Education in the Philippines” by Ani Rosa Almario and Tina Zamora (Bughaw/Ateneo de Manila University Press) is especially relevant these days with the growing concern about basic education in the country, in the light of our students’ dismal performance in international assessments for both high school and elementary students. All 19 authors are acknowledged to be proponents of nontraditional education in the country and comprise of school administrators, teachers, parents, students. What surfaces in their accounts is the joy of learning and teaching that they have with their students. School is life, school is fun. “Tatay’s Ilang-Ilang Tree” by Gidget Jimenez, illustrated by Elle Shivers (Green Convergence for Safe Food, Healthy Environment and Sustainable Economy and Environmental Studies Institute, Miriam College) is a charming story describing how the narrator’s gardener father taught her to talk to trees just as his own father had taught him, too. He gave her good advice: Trees need some sun, water and much talking to. In time, the narrator discovers a special relationship with the ilang-ilang tree, “… I was no longer alone. I was with his ilang-ilang.” The detail about the father working in the Big House is an interesting one as it quite incidentally portrays the social classes of our society. Because her father cared for the ilang-ilang tree, “We could smell the perfume of its gratitude for many years.” This is one of five books highlighting Philippine trees, all inspired by essays written in the important volumes, “Philippine Native Trees: Up Close and Personal.” “Tiempo Muerto” by Caroline Hau (Bughaw/Ateneo de Manila University Press) is the first novel of respected scholar and fictionist Hau. It is the story of two women who are back on the island where they shared a childhood. The storyline is gripping as the reader follows the lives and the fates of Racel, the overseas Filipino worker, and Lia, the heiress of the balay daku, and its many secrets. Racel recalls that as a child, “I once asked my mother why she didn’t couldn’t wouldn’t leave the balay daku to live with us….” Lia returning to the balay daku, “told herself that there were no monsters in the house, only the comings and goings of strangers.” “Unang Dalaw: First Period” by Luis P. Gatmaitan, illustrated by Hulyen (OMF Literature Inc.) is a helpful book of 12 chapters for young girls who are typically fearful, baffled and uncertain about what the menstrual period is all about. Old wives’ tales about not taking a bath or not eating anything sour on those days are touched upon. And the familiar names used to refer to the period—period, visitor—are mentioned in the introduction, before the experiences of Bianca and Sofia are narrated. It is a clever choice of a title for this informative text which answers all the questions about menstruation in a dignified scientific manner. And who is a better authority to tackle this sensitive topic than a pediatrician like Gatmaitan? “The World Is Still Beautiful” by Lázaro Francisco, translated by Mona P. Highley (Bughaw/Ateneo de Manila University Press). Francisco, posthumously recognized as National Artist for Literature, is recognized as a landmark novelist in Philippine literature for his social realistic fiction. His Tagalog novels gained a large following in Liwayway Magazine where they were serialized and eagerly awaited weekly. This first translation into English of one of his novels has become necessary to make Francisco known to a wider audience. He was a writer ahead of his times, writing in the 1950s about the disparities in society with the exploited farmers having to contend with profit-oriented landowners. —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
"Overindulgence, COVID stress may trigger ‘holiday heart’ syndrome",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/376602/overindulgence-covid-stress-may-trigger-holiday-heart-syndrome/,"12:12 PM December 22, 2020","Heart patients dread the virus more, not realizing that their heart condition could be up to 30 times deadlier This week, I had to advise a couple of patients with longstanding heart problems to be confined for observation because of increasing frequency of chest pains. They were hesitant to go to the hospital, but I explained to them the simple options: remote risk of catching the virus, or imminent risk of a heart attack. They made the right choice, and are currently doing well. They should be discharged in a few days. Physicians attending to heart patients have long been extra vigilant this time of the year because of the so-called “holiday heart” syndrome. There is a spike in heart attacks, strokes and even sudden cardiac death during the holiday season. Several published studies note modest increases in these cardiovascular complications during the holiday season peaking on Christmas Day, with a second peak on New Year’s Eve. A 2004-2008 survey of Metro Manila hospitals showed a tripling of emergencies and admissions during Christmastime. That is a 200-percent increase. We thought it wouldn’t be a major issue this year since there is much less partying and alcohol drinking, but the stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be an additional triggering factor. A colleague noted that we’re having more out-of-hospital heart-related deaths because many don’t want to go to the hospital for fear of getting infected with COVID-19. That is the big paradox we have with heart patients; they dread the virus more, not realizing that their heart condition could be up to 30 times deadlier. And once they develop a heart attack, the season of joy turns into a season of mourning for their family. Heart patients should be forewarned of this real threat of potentially deadly cardiovascular complications, so they don’t increase their risk unwittingly with an unhealthy lifestyle, particularly in this COVID-aggravated season. Half of these cardiovascular attacks could end up in sudden cardiac death. These hapless patients probably don’t even know what hit them. They can die on the spot, or they succumb even before reaching the hospital, when they finally decide to seek medical help. A sad illustration of this risk is what was reported in a remote Sicilian town several years ago, when three middle-aged brothers all had a heart attack on the same day, with two dying suddenly. The third one was fortunate to be in a hospital when his heart attack happened, and prompt intervention in the emergency room stabilized his condition. This may be an extreme situation and is not likely to happen to the average family. One can argue also that the three brothers were likely genetically predisposed to develop cardiovascular events, but it still goes to show that the relatively cold weather, lifestyle recklessness, undue stress of the season and the simply overcharged atmosphere can trigger a heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular events, particularly in high-risk patients. It could save some lives if these patients are identified and adequately forewarned about the incipient danger that comes with the start of the usually hectic holiday celebration. Mentally, they could prepare themselves and have the discipline to say “no” to food and alcohol overindulgence. Overindulgence has been blamed as a major culprit responsible for the increased cardiovascular risk during the holiday season. You add the lingering stress and paranoia over COVID-19, and the unhealthy mix of all these triggering factors could simmer into a catastrophic stew of a fatal heart attack. Physicians can give cardiovascular patients, particularly those classified as high-risk, a most memorable Christmas gift by properly forewarning them of this real and perilous risk during the holidays. Heeding the good old advice could go a long way in saving one’s life. Avoid excess salt, fats and alcohol. Binge drinking has been shown to trigger atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rhythm, which increases the risk of stroke, heart attack and heart failure. Heart patients should also keep themselves warm. When their hands feel cold, that may indicate that the arteries are constricting and when this happens to diseased heart arteries, it might result in a lack of oxygen, called ischemia, which might lead to a heart attack if prolonged. So, heart patients, always dress warmly. Lack of sleep is a potential trigger, too, due to the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system which raises our adrenaline level. The year 2020 is already bad enough. Let’s not make it any worse by falling victim to the holiday heart syndrome. We wish everyone a joyful and healthful Yuletide season.

"Nature, self-determination and the pandemic on the mind of Baguio artists",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/376173/nature-self-determination-and-the-pandemic-on-the-mind-of-baguio-artists/,"04:59 PM December 14, 2020","‘Interlinked’ presents the varied works of 34 artists on different issues but united in expressing the fragility of life Baguio has prevalent issues that also reflect national concerns over environmental degradation, heavy vehicular traffic on the main thoroughfares and the felling not just of trees but of freedom-loving patriots, among others. The Unesco-declared Creative City of Folk Arts and Crafts is home to a teeming community of artists and artisans, they who can articulate these concerns in what they are doing. In the exhibition “Interlinked,” ongoing at the mezzanine of the newly refurbished Baguio Convention Center until Dec. 15 (open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., except on Mondays), the community, made up of novice, midcareer and veteran artists, comes together to give what to curator Erlyn Ruth Alcantara is “the city’s distinctive cultural expression.” This time around 34 individuals expressed their views through traditional media, mixed media, assemblages, installations, sculptures, et al., on the sacredness of life, even of property. Their means of expression may be diverse, but the artists are united on a deeper level. Perhaps the fragility of life becomes more pronounced as the COVID-19 pandemic goes on. Gallery A draws together responses to the pandemic and interpretations of Cordillera folklore. Oliver Olivete’s massive “Preystation 3X” stuns near the entrance with its bright colors of a child’s playthings (Legos and other miniature figurines) assembled together behind glass with Mickey Mouse, or at least his recognizable ears, serving as the dominant outline. At a time when children are going online for their education using smartphones, laptops and tablets, the work contains a foreboding of what the future holds for a computer screen-besotted generation. John Frank Sabado’s “COVID-19 No Trespassing” is like a loom with familiar Cordillera patterns in the weave and the coronavirus at the center of it all. The gallery guide let us know that there was another way of looking at the work—from the side, not just front, of the panel. If one moves one’s phone or one’s eyes very slowly, the work seems like a deck of cards being shuffled. Silvino Dulnuan’s acrylic painting “Silent Night” presents an untamed forest teeming with wildlife that dwarfs the sole man on the canvas. The eagle, deer, snake, even the dragonfly, are all larger than him, signifying that these fauna deserve as much space on this earth as human beings. Roberto Acosta’s terra-cotta sculptures have been scaled down since he began his explorations with this medium during his University of the Philippines Baguio teaching years. Nonetheless, the artist makes a powerful plea for people to heed the cry of Nature in his two pieces, “Agyaman” and “Nu Dinggem.” His male and female figures play musical instruments to show the sweetness, the necessity of things evergreen. Refreshing are the watercolor and ink on paper works of Danielle Florendo, a children’s book illustrator. In one piece she shows a Benguet market scene. The faces of the crowd are rendered sideways to imply how each person is so involved in the day’s business and busyness. Haunting are two small works by now Cagayan de Oro-based painter Kelly Ramos: the ethereal “Old House Stories” and “Baguio Three Witch3s,” the latter a homage to the city’s three deceased environmental activists and now spirit guides (Gene de Guia, Cecile Afable and Leonora San Agustin). Liza Ilagan, known for her batik cloth series, experiments with a new medium, pewter repujado (embossing) on acrylic painting, in her “Ang Kanyang Kamahalan” and “Hinabing Pagmamahal.” Writer-visual artist Rocky Cajigan does hyperrealist renditions of products in the Baguio market from fish and meat to broccoli, cucumbers, eggplants, okra and charcoal. They all come wrapped in ever-present, transparent plastic bags that the city is trying to discourage in usage. The same Gallery A houses works of Bumbo Villanueva who doesn’t hide the influence of his late father, the sculptor-educator Ben-Hur. The bronze “Ang Duwende ng Sarimanok” features the mythical bird of the Maranaos with an elf astride its back. The feeling it gives off is lightweight, especially the way the bird’s flying feathers were carved. It was a rest from the heaviness of the messages conveyed by previous artworks. Gallery B is devoted to politics and Cordillera culture. Leonard Aguinaldo’s provocative floor-to-ceiling woodcut on paper “45” indicts the perpetrators behind the cutting of 45 pine trees to give way to a giant mall’s expansion. There is an altar-like, backlit installation, “Banwar ti Umili,” translated to “The People’s Heroes,” put up by the collective Sulong Likha. It features Pedro Dungoc, Lumbaya Gayudan and Macli-ing Dulag, who were on the forefront of the anti-Chico Dam movement. They are considered martyrs in the Cordillera people’s defense of ancestral lands and in the struggle for self-determination. Fara Manuel Nolasco’s installation “We’re Not Here: Mother and Child” can be read on many levels. On the literal and symbolic planes, there is a makeshift shelter in camouflage material (in increasingly militarized surroundings?). The clothes of the mother are in blue and white (the suffering madonna’s colors?) hanging alongside her underwear and those of her vulnerable child. Katti Sta. Ana’s assemblage “Car-free City” contains the longing for a biker-and pedestrian-friendly city with everything that this dream implies: less carbon dioxide emissions, healthier lifestyles, decongested streets that can thus be opened for small- to medium-size entrepreneurial undertakings. Hermie Bruno put together the unraveled threads of several canvases and painted over them to create the partner pieces “Layad Ya Gaget en Ama.” They were the first two works sold during the opening of the exhibition and extol the love of parents and their hard work. Other artists participating are: Francis Alingcayon, Edmund Andrada, Clinton Aniversario, Angelo Aurelio, Roland Bay-an, Lorraine Borillo, Jandy Carvajal, Kizel Cotiw-an, Akwey Dalusong, Alfonso Dato, Kawayan de Guia, Tet Enciso, Resty Lopez, Willy Magtibay, Jordan Mang-osan, Venazir Martinez, Tioan Medrano, Dexter Simsim, Mark Tandoyog and Jeff van den Broeck.

‘Be patient and leave them be’: Tips for growing succulents,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/375425/be-patient-and-leave-them-be-tips-for-growing-succulents/,"03:08 PM December 02, 2020","'They are slow growers and the more you keep checking on them, the greater your frustration' There is every kind of plantita and plantito. Some collect the biggest possible ornamental plants while others want to focus on growing herbs and vegetables. Others like to collect plants that could fit in the palm of their hands. Succulents are plants that can survive without water because they store moisture in their leaves, stems and roots. There are different kinds of succulents. Others look like roses while some bloom into different colors. We asked Succulent Republique’s administrator Joshua Reyes on where to start if you want to add succulents to your plant collection. Early this month, we reported how the Facebook group successfully held an auction for the victims of typhoons “Rolly” and “Ulysses.” “Someone new to the hobby can start with Benguet propagations. These are locally propagated succulents and are not so pricey,” he said. A lot of 5 to 15 Benguet succulents can cost between P1,250-P2,000, including shipping fees. Of course, there are risks in transporting items during the pandemic. A delay can be detrimental to the plants’ health. But if all goes well, your collection will arrive safely, ready to be air-dried and repotted. Reyes suggests starting with sturdy kinds such as Monroe, champagne and other colorful but easy-to-grow varieties. Asking the right questions is also important. Use a Plant ID app to identify the plants you are buying to know how to care for them. “If you are buying online, it is best to ask for a size reference on the images. A good size for an Echeveria to have a greater chance of thriving should be anywhere between 3-4 inches,” he said. Reyes has been growing succulents for two years now. His favorites include Sedum Clavatum because of its sweet candy scent, laui for its thick flawless farina (wax covering the leaf of the succulents) and Amethystinum for its pink, powdery sun-stressed glow. Having the right growing medium is the foundation for growing healthy succulents, he emphasized. Because they are mostly desert plants, they do not thrive on wet mediums for long periods of time. He recommends the brand Masitera for the CNS premix (cactus and succulents). Should succulents be smothered with love or be left alone? “I go by ‘tanim kalimot,'” he said. “Succulents are slow growers and the more you keep checking on them, the greater your frustration as they don’t seem to be showing improvements. I suggest putting them in a spot where they receive ample sun and just leave them be.” Before you try to sun-stress your succulents, it should have been under your care for three months. Prioritize making them root first to become plump and juicy, he advised. Succulents turn into a different color when they are stressed by the sun, making them beautiful. Most of all, Reyes said that growers should have patience. Succulents have a different requirement from regular plants. Some need to be watered every two weeks. When you finally feel confident growing, that’s when you can invest in the more expensive varieties from South Korea.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
"IF can benefit patients with diabetes, high BP",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/375413/if-can-benefit-patients-with-diabetes-high-bp/,"02:52 PM December 02, 2020","Intermittent fasting can stave off development of Alzheimer’s and may help reduce risk of heart attack and stroke Two weekends ago, my 52-year-old overweight, diabetic patient called me up frantically early in the morning and told me that he could not sustain his intermittent fasting or IF because it was giving him palpitations and profuse sweating, especially in the wee hours of the morning. He was feeling these symptoms at the time he called me. He started doing IF after reading our column recommending it (“Skeptic tries intermittent fasting,” 11/03/20). He immediately went on a 16-hour fast and still continued the medicines he was taking for diabetes and high blood pressure at the same doses. I asked him to check his blood pressure (BP), heart rate and blood sugar. The BP was well within normal limits. The pulse rate was fast at 110 per minute, and his blood sugar was quite low at 68 mg/dL. He was having hypoglycemia or low blood sugar, and his symptoms were related to it. After drinking a glass of orange juice, he felt so much better and his blood sugar levels during the day were already within normal range. Of course, I asked him to stop his IF momentarily and adjusted the dose of his antidiabetic meds. So for those with health issues like high BP, diabetes and heart disease, and those who are taking medicines for these health problems, they should get instructions from their physicians first on the dose adjustment of their maintenance medications, before starting IF. For my patient, we tried IF again after several days, cutting his meds by almost half and monitoring his blood sugar regularly for the first several days. There are no more symptoms of hypoglycemia so far, and he says he’s getting adjusted to his new diet. So the presence of diabetes or high BP is not a contraindication to IF. In fact, IF can help control the BP and blood sugar with fewer meds. Monitoring of blood sugar and BP is advised for a week or two after starting IF to determine the optimal adjusted dose. The dose adjustment needs to be individualized and tailor-fit for each patient. IF alleviates the insulin resistance which is usually seen in diabetic patients. With IF, the body’s cells become more sensitive to insulin, allowing more efficient transport and use of the sugar in the bloodstream to the body cells. This, together with the blood sugar-lowering effect of fasting, helps control the blood sugar, and prevents the so-called yo-yo effect in diabetes, wherein the blood sugar spikes up then dives at other times. However, the magnitude of this effect may differ from one person to another. Men and women also appear to respond differently. So it’s difficult to set guidelines on how much reduction in the dose of maintenance medicines we should prescribe. We just have to individualize the dose adjustments based on the monitoring of the BP and blood sugar. My patient was told by his friend that because the brain cells are starved during the fasting state, IF might cause rapid deterioration of brain function and predispose one to developing Alzheimer’s disease or AD. Nothing is further from the truth. Actually, IF can stave off the development of AD and other forms of dementia. Sugar is not really a very effective source of energy, but in a regularly fed state, it is the most convenient source, so all the cells of the body including the brain cells use sugar to generate energy. The shift of metabolism from sugar to fats can benefit the brain and other organs significantly. IF also reduces oxidative stress, which is a very damaging process that can happen in the brain and other vital organs, including the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys. Furthermore, IF increases levels of a brain hormone called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is another probable reason for the enhancement in brain function with IF. When we fast, as in IF, the body shifts its metabolism or manner of generating energy from sugar to fats, which is the more efficient source of energy. This mobilizes our fats instead of storing them in the fat depots. So our weight goes down and our areas where fat is stored, like the belly or midsection part, get trimmed down. In effect, we become leaner and develop a more toned body, rather than a fat-embellished one with hanging tissue accessories all over. A beneficial effect on the arteries of the body and the organs they serve has been shown extensively in experimental animals, and there’s good reason to believe the same benefits can be expected in humans. We may not realize it, but there’s a slow-burning inflammation insidiously taking place in the human body. This inflammation causes the arterial lining, called endothelium, to swell, leading to the progressive narrowing of these arteries. When these arteries become significantly occluded, the blood supply to the vital organs is impaired, causing ischemia, and it can get progressively worse, leading to death of the tissues, called infarction. When this happens in the heart, it’s called myocardial infarction, and when it happens in the brain, it’s called a cerebrovascular accident, or simply, a stroke. So, again, researchers have shown in experimental animals that IF can help reduce this risk of inflammation and may help reduce the risk of complications like heart attack and stroke. The reduction in inflammation can also affect favorably the immune system. And with this comes the possible reduction in other chronic or longstanding conditions like cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. IF takes some getting used to, especially at the start. What is important is that one does not throw in the towel at the first experience of symptoms believed to be related to or caused by IF. Just like in my patient, the symptoms or experienced side effects of IF can just be at the start, and could be easily managed with some adjustments in the duration of IF or the doses of the medicines one is taking. Persist, persevere and reap the benefits of IF.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Death by ‘tuob’? It’s been known to happen,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/375410/death-by-tuob-its-been-known-to-happen/,"02:50 PM December 02, 2020","Doctors warn of potential dangers of seemingly harmless home remedy It’s been around for generations, an easy and inexpensive home remedy to alleviate the discomforts of a clogged nose, nasal allergies, a bad cough, or the flu. Yet for all the relief experienced after tuob (also suob) or steam inhalation, the seemingly innocuous practice can actually do more harm than good. This was emphasized by doctors in “To steam or not to steam: A discussion on steam inhalation as a health remedy,” a virtual symposium hosted recently by pharmaceutical and health-care company Unilab as part of its “Alagang Unilab: HealthierPH” awareness campaign series. Tuob, which involves inhaling steam from a basin filled with hot water, has not undergone years of objective research the way prescription drugs have to prove their safety and efficacy, says Dr. Roland Panaligan, medical manager, United American Pharmaceuticals (UAP)-Unilab Respiratory Division. “We don’t know of any studies that measure the ideal temperature of the water or the recommended length of time to do tuob. Steam inhalation is a remedy, a relief. It’s not for treatment.” “One of the most exposed parts of the human body is the lungs,” adds pulmonologist and biochemist Dr. Earl Louis Sempio. “Each time we inhale, we take in air that may carry infectious particles. This makes the lungs very vulnerable to infections.” Of late, the age-old practice has been under fire as a supposed cure for COVID-19—with detrimental results. In June, a 34-year-old female vendor in Cagayan de Oro City used tuob to relieve her of symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus. When more serious symptoms cropped up—abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, shortness of breath—she was rushed to Northern Mindanao Medical Center, only to die nine minutes after she arrived. Cases like this have led local and international health organizations to issue stern warnings against using tuob to address symptoms related to COVID-19. “The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization deny that steam inhalation can treat COVID-19,” said Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a virtual presser in June. “The virus may get into the steam, which may cause diseases. It also increases nasal secretions that can be spread through coughing and sneezing.” “Scientific studies suggest that steam inhalation is indeed effective against symptoms of colds and that it increases nasal patency,” said the Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care in its official statement dated June 30. “It is a safe remedy if done properly, but can possibly hurt otherwise.” What exactly happens during tuob? The moist and warm steam you inhale helps loosen mucus in your nasal passages, throat and lungs. This makes it easier to expel phlegm, thus providing much-needed relief from congestion. It does not, as medical specialists repeat time and again, kill germs. Tuob done wrong has resulted in severe scalding from the boiling water, as stated in medical reports from India and the United Kingdom, where steam inhalation is also being practiced. Complications could arise, too, when the water in tuob is infused with eucalyptus oil, camphor or menthol. “If you look at its structure, menthol is a chemical,” says Dr. Sempio. “But it is also an irritant and anything in excess could cause more problems. Doing tuob infused with menthol to relieve you of COVID-like symptoms might make you cough and release droplets infected with the COVID-19 virus.” Like menthol, camphor—an ingredient found in topical analgesics and ointments to ease muscle pain from sports and discomfort from colds and coughs—is an irritant. But it is also flammable and hazardous. According to studies, unintentional exposure of very young children to camphor and eucalyptus oil has resulted in drowsiness, vomiting, seizure, coma and even death. As for tuob infused with lemon, salt and other substances, relief from congestion is about the only thing you can expect. There is no evidence proving that it can cure you of the coronavirus, said an official release from the Department of Health Cordillera Center for Health Development. Why then do we continue to rely on tuob despite its temporary effects and potential dangers? “I guess it’s because when we experience relief, we automatically assume we are better or cured,” says Dr. Sempio. For doctors, the best way to treat an ailment—whether it’s the common cold or the highly contagious COVID-19—begins with prevention. Get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, exercise regularly, and avoid excessive smoking and drinking. Practicing health protocols adds a layer of protection: Wear a face mask and face shield, sanitize your hands often and observe social distancing. Staying informed is important, too, and Dr. Sempio likes that his patients often refer to “Dr. Google” to better understand their condition. “But make sure you get it from a reliable source,” he says. Of course, Dr. Google and tuob are no match for the expertise of a trained physician. “When you have a hard time breathing, that’s already a red flag and you only have a small window of opportunity to address it,” he says. “See your doctor right away.” —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Prestigious US firm to publish Filipino author Sophia Lee’s book,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/374636/prestigious-us-firm-to-publish-filipino-author-sophia-lees-book/,"11:04 PM November 16, 2020","The story of ‘Holding On,’ illustrated by Pepper Roxas, stems from Lee’s childhood summers spent with her grandparents in Tarlac When Sophia N. Lee was growing up, she spent her summers in Tarlac, in the care of her paternal grandparents. “I was a very sickly kid, and this was the time I would be nurtured back to health by my grandfather who we called Dada, my grandmother Mama Jessie and my father’s sister, Tita Lynn,” Lee recalled. “Those summers stand out in my mind as times when I felt incredibly loved—I remember dancing as my grandfather sang and played the ukulele in the early mornings, eating only my favorite food, playing tindera at my wawa’s (my Lola’s sister’s) sari-sari store, and having the most restful sleep.” Lee would grow up to win the Scholastic Asian Book Award in 2014 for her young adult novel “What Things Mean,” with Scholastic Asia in Singapore publishing that novel in 2016. She then moved to Manhattan, New York, where she earned her Master of Fine Arts in Writing for Children and Young Adults at The New School. Last year, Scholastic Asia published her second title, a picture book called “Soaring Saturdays.” But her own story with her grandparents also continued turning like the pages of a book. “It’s also the story of how my relationship with my lola progressed and changed over time, as she learned to live on her own after my lolo’s death, and as she slowly succumbed to Alzheimer’s and dementia in her later years,” she explained. “She migrated to the US, and because I went here for my MFA, I’m grateful I got to spend some of her last years with her. I was writing this story when her illness progressed, and I witnessed how strongly she fought to remember her past. I wanted to honor that somehow through this story.” That story came to life as “Holding On,” her novel about a girl’s summers visiting her lola: “a celebration and remembrance of things she and her lola love—favorite food, cozy traditions, special memories, but most especially, their shared love of music… As the girl grows bigger and her lola finds it harder to remember, each of them finds ways to hold close the things that they love.” Lee’s agent, Wendi Gu, shopped the manuscript around and arranged phone calls for Lee to speak with acquiring editors about her inspirations and background. “Holding On” then went into an auction for the book rights. “From there we just waited and then decided on what felt like the best offer for us,” Lee said. “Though it wasn’t as fast-paced as art auctions often are, it was an incredibly emotional experience for me,” she said. “Not long after we went on submission, my own lola passed away unexpectedly from complications due to old age. It was right in the middle of the lockdown in New York, and because of COVID restrictions, we weren’t able to give her the memorial and funeral that she deserved. We sold the book on her pasiyam, the ninth day from her passing. I like to think that that was her way of reminding me that she was still there, taking care of me the way she always did.” The winning bidder was Atheneum Books for Young Readers, the legendary youth imprint of giant Simon & Schuster, and publisher of titles such as Judy Blume’s “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret,” Ian Falconer’s “Olivia the Pig,” and Deborah and James Howe’s “Bunnicula.” Lee still can’t quite believe it: “It feels incredibly surreal. Like pinch-me-am-I-dreaming surreal, for sure! ‘Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret’ was one of the first books I read when I was starting to write, and that was one of the books that made me realize that I wanted to write books for young readers. It made me wish I had read that book as a kid, because I was the sort of kid who always looked to books for answers on how to navigate the world. It’s an honor to know my books will share the same home as those books, and I just hope that they’ll be just as beloved.” It is. After all, it was Lee’s first book with an American publisher. When Lee was working on “Soaring Saturdays,” she had insisted a Filipino illustrate the book—Aaron Asis. She had the same request for her editor at Atheneum, Judy McCarthy, and they had the perfect person in mind. Isabel “Pepper” Roxas was born in Manila but is now based in New York. She has made a name as an illustrator of children’s books—she already did the art for nine titles published in the United States, including Filipino American Erin Entrada Kelly’s Newbery Medal-winning “Hello Universe” (soon to be a Netflix series) and had worked with Atheneum before. “I’m thrilled to be working with them again, of course. I think it’s also really wonderful that they are making a push for ‘own voices’ stories that will help diversify the American publishing landscape,” Roxas said. Interestingly, the two had never met despite both living in New York. “I don’t know Isabel personally, though I’ve known of her and have been a fan of her work ever since I started writing,” Lee said. “She’s illustrated some of my favorite books for children. Since this is the first Filipino picture book that Atheneum is publishing, we wanted it to be illustrated by a Filipino artist as well, and we knew that Isabel would do right by the story. I love the warmth, whimsy and heart that’s always present in her work, and my editor feels the same way.” Roxas said she believes “Holding On” has an additional significance for her. “For me, as a Filipino abroad, it also speaks about missing home and the comfort that music, food and memory can bring. These are all themes that are close to my heart, so it was fortuitous that this manuscript made it to my drawing table,” she said. Lee’s work is done, so now it will be up to Roxas to add the magic to get the book out by its target street date of summer 2022. “We’re at the very beginning of the process… Plenty of work left to do, and I am looking forward to really digging in,” Roxas said. So while Roxas gets to work on “Holding On,” Lee is already at work on what comes next: “I’ve already begun work on the second book, and after that, I’m excited to begin some other stories in the pipeline—a middle-grade comedy about a young aspiring author, and a YA novel that I call my food and feelings book.” But in the meantime, the images of one Filipino girl’s indelible summer memories emerge from Roxas’ imagination, and Lee dreams of a different summer over a year from now: “It was really important to me to ground this book in Filipino life. So much of the small moments in the book celebrate my favorite things about being Filipino—our shared sentimentality, the reverence we have for our elderly, our love for our food, music and traditions. I’m proud to say that while the story itself is universal, this is a deeply Filipino book.” INQ  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
"Gilda, immortal beloved",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/374232/gilda-immortal-beloved/,"10:16 PM November 09, 2020","‘Lola Mad Hatters Party’ Halloween tribute to Gilda Cordero Fernando a smashing success At 81 attendees at one point, the Halloween Zoom tribute to Gilda Cordero Fernando, billed the “Lola Mad Hatters Party,” was a smashing success, not counting those who watched the event live on YouTube. Everyone whose life was touched by the woman described by emcee Kate Torralba as an “energetic force of nature” came wearing an assortment of hats.Gilda might have uttered from her heavenly post her typical bukambibig: “Ang cuuuuuttte!” The tributes opened with a Fernando family-produced video for Gilda’s 40th day of passing Oct. 5. Son Mol narrated: “She responds to ‘GCF’ (as in GCF Books) to journalists and writer friends; ‘Ka Universe’ to comrades of her left-leaning Promethean cohort. One has to be off-kilter to warrant her attention, but as Danton Remoto writes, ‘Then and now, Gilda suffered no fools.’ “To family and the closest of her friends, she is ‘Lola Mad.’ Sorry to disappoint but the moniker isn’t rooted in the word ‘mad,’ adj., mentally ill; insane; though it seems totally apt. “Sometime in the mid-’90s when the grandchildren started coming, growing and interacting with their grandparents, we began calling our dad, GCF’s husband Marcelo Fernando, ‘Fad,’ short for ‘father or Fader’ turning into ‘Lolo Fad,’ with ‘Mader,’ ‘Mad’ or ‘Lola Mad’ naturally evolving from there.” National Artist Virgilio Almario followed with his reading of “Kay Gilda” a la Francisco Balagtas’ “Kay Celia.” Poet Danilo M. Reyes shared a video of another National Artist, Salvador Bernal, and Gilda speaking at the Ateneo Art Awards and defining what immortality is. To her it may even not be about awards or being a hero, but doing memorable acts every day, like living a life of honesty. In the end, she said, being immortal may mean being anonymous. Journalist and fashion plate Myrza Sison listed the 10 lessons she learned from Gilda, on top of which was, “Love is not romantic but all about giving.” From the older woman she also learned that “the universe gives all the answers if you listen.” Actor Banaue Miclat-Janssen sang her sister Maningning’s poem “Tawag,” set to music by Jesse Lucas, followed by a viewing of a Gilbert Daroy caricature of the late graphic designer Manny Chaves, Gilda’s best friend, and she herself in her pustoriosa glory. Fictionist-activist Ninotchka Rosca, wearing a hairband made up of miniature hats, said each time she made a voyage to the homeland from the United States, she broke bread with Gilda. As a teenager meeting Gilda for the first time, she remembered the first lesson she received: light breathing and breathing light. The members of the Lipstick Gang, aka GCF Fun Club, were captured partying with their icon with the music of Sampaguita’s rocking “Bonggahan” and Sylvia La Torre’s “Arimunding-Munding” in the background. Writers Kris Lacaba and Kit Kwe, with their three small children afoot and stealing the show, thanked their wedding sponsor, Gilda, for being supportive in their creative endeavors. Kwe praised her for being “an ally of those who advance the interests of women.” Church Café, a mix of visual artists, writers and other cultural workers, presented an interpretative reading of Gilda’s essay “Close Encounters with Bliss” from “A Spiritual Pillow Book.” The readers were Alma Miclat, Fe Mangahas, Julie Lluch, Mario Miclat, Ruth Elynia Mabanglo, Imelda Cajipe Endaya and Jenny Llaguno. Writer Jeannie Javelosa read a short excerpt from Gilda’s essay “A Garden Story” from the latter’s memoir “Ladies’ Lunch and Other Ways to Wholeness.” Another writing couple, also godchildren of Gilda, fictionist Sarge Lacuesta and poet Mookie Katigbak, sang from their marriage bed a Leonard Cohen song. The Women for the Ouster of Marcos and Bases wowed as they shimmied and shook to Ricky Martin’s “She Bangs.” Narrator Nikki Coseteng credited Gilda for banging the drums of history loudly. Seen dancing a mix of jazz and cha-cha were such parliament of the streets figures as Coseteng herself, Joji Ravina-Lourence, Daphne Ceniza, Judy Taguiwalo and Vikky Bondoc Cabrera. Alon Alon Dance Circle, featuring Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Awardee Ligaya Amilbangsa and CB Garrucho, danced a bula-bula, a variation of the Mindanao dance form pangalay. Bodjie Pascua and partner Avic Ilagan reminisced about the Gilda who’d invite them to her home—they’d start chatting at lunch and end when it was already dark. He said, “We enjoyed each other’s presence moment by moment. Gilda, you’ve really enriched our lives.” The women of the Center for Health and Creative Arts (Chacra), led by Mariel Francisco, also gave an audio-visual presentation (AVP) to the tune of Cohen’s “Dance Me to the End of Love.” Gilda joined Chacra activities like a climb of Mt. Banahaw through rugged terrain to learn its sacred mysteries and debuting as a lecturer of the Goldies Workshop for senior citizens. The Chacra women exclaimed: “Oh Mother G! It was you after all who led the way to the Age of Aquarius! Look behind you! We’re trailing right behind!” Social anthropologist-writer Melba Maggay read a poem for Gilda, which told of how bereft and orphaned the people she left behind are. At the same time, they wished her “Bon Voyage to the Sky World.” Dancers-videographers Nonoy Froilan and Edna Vida showed a rare behind-the-scenes look into the making of the grand Gilda production “Luna: An Aswang Romance.” There were precious scenes of director Anton Juan going to the extent of correcting the movements of the actors at the ballet barre. The First Draft group of 10 women writers, founded by Gilda in 2002, also presented an AVP to the music of “Body and Soul” by Tony Bennett and Amy Winehouse. First Draftee Chit Roces-Santos recalled, “Gilda taught us to be candid and not be afraid to be ourselves. She often chastised us for our timidity. ‘Readers can spot fakeness,’ she said.” Susan Calalay, Gilda’s classmate in the study of anthroposophy under egghead Nicky Perlas, remembered how their teacher cast them as witches, which she thought they were at heart. Acknowledged was Gilda’s support of her LGBTQ friends, from couples Rossana Abueva and Monique Wilson to Robert Alejandro and Jetro Rafael. The last two danced up a storm before Typhoon “Rolly” (international name: Goni) hit to the tune of Madonna’s “Material Girl.” The people behind the “Umuulan Umaaraw Kinakasal ang Tikbalang,” led by playwright Rody Vera and director Jose Estrella, showed slides from the play based on Gilda’s book on mythological creatures “The Magic Circle.” The chat box filled up with accolades for the tributes. PR maven Joy Buensalido wrote, “This is the best send-off party anyone could have given.” Garrucho said, “It’s so amazing how many different sets of friends Gilda had!” Alejandro agreed: “We are so blessed by Gilda.” Writer Neni Sta.

How to maximize your immunity,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/373917/how-to-maximize-your-immunity/,"06:55 PM November 03, 2020","We can’t do anything about our age, but we can prevent and reverse lifestyle diseases that put us at risk for all coronaviruses There is a cartoon of a doctor mopping a wet floor and someone asking, “For how long do we have to clean this up?” The doctor says, “Forever.” The other says, “Why don’t we just shut off the faucet?” Doctors keep prescribing medication because they don’t believe their patients will ever change their habits, the underlying cause of the problem. They’re trained to do sick care, not health care. While we are still preoccupied with containing COVID-19, the next coronaviruses are already incubating, if not already unleashed. In a clip from “60 Minutes Australia,” environmental and human rights investigator Steven Galster, exposed “sleeping time bombs,” as wildlife markets similar to Wuhan’s continue to operate in Bangkok, among other places worldwide: “These animals are never together in the wild and so are vulnerable to viruses carried by each other. Their extreme stress, which diminishes their immune systems, adds to the potential of these viruses crossing over to humans zoonotically (across species) during the handling process at markets, including during slaughter. We need to not just shut down the markets in China, you need to shut them down in other places, too. Otherwise it’s going to expand or recur.” Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) is another animal virus from bats spread to civet cats and humans, again in China. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) came from camels. Ebola is not a coronavirus, but it, too, is animal-borne, with bats or primates as possible sources. Bird flu is a virus that can infect birds, humans and other animals. What should we already know by now? The World Health Organization cautions people visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places with animals to practice general hygiene. But how about not bothering these animals altogether? Industries and cultures will need to adjust, but as Galster put it, “Mother Nature’s revenge” is already forcefully course-correcting us anyway. While COVID-19 initially ravaged senior citizens, anyone with underlying health conditions is just as vulnerable. These include chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic neurological conditions, diabetes, HIV/ AIDS, steroids or chemotherapy and being seriously overweight (a body mass index of 40 or above). We can’t do anything about our age, but we can do something about preventing and even reversing lifestyle diseases that put us at risk for all coronaviruses. Dean Ornish, M.D., the father of lifestyle medicine, was the first to prove that comprehensive lifestyle changes can reverse even severe coronary heart disease and improve chronic conditions, without drugs or surgery. His latest book “Undo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases” talks about how we should “eat well, live more, stress less, love more.” Ornish talked about how physicians are trained to treat heart disease, diabetes, prostate and breast cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, etc. as different diseases. “But they’re not. They’re the same disease manifesting in different ways because they all share the same underlying biological mechanisms: oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, changes in the microbiome, telomeres and gene expression, angiogenesis and so on. Each mechanism is influenced by what we eat, how we respond to stress, how much exercise and how much love and support we have,” he said. “It’s not like there’s one diet for reversing heart disease, and a different diet to reverse the next chronic disease; it’s the same for reversing all. It’s also why we see many people suffering from several of these diseases at the same time.” He had debated with Dr. Atkins many times before the latter died of heart disease. “Atkins was right that people were eating too many refined carbs. But he failed to substitute with carbs in their natural, unrefined state. These fill you up before you get so many calories and are high fiber so they’re low on the glycemic index,” said Ornish. “The Atkins diet is the same as the keto diet, the paleo diet and other repackaged Atkins spinoffs. It keeps resurrecting because people like to hear good news about their bad habits, that eating meat is good for you, even if it’s not.” Ornish added, “On a whole food plant-based diet, you can eat whenever you’re hungry, you can eat until you’re full, there’s no deprivation, and you still lose weight and keep it off for the rest of your life. “Going WFPB is crucial instead of just ‘going vegan’ because you can still be a fat, unhealthy vegan and get sick if you continue to eat high fat, salt, sugar and processed foods. If you’re trying to lose weight, eliminate oils; it’s 100-percent fat.” —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Skeptic tries intermittent fasting,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/373905/skeptic-tries-intermittent-fasting/,"05:42 PM November 03, 2020","I used to be a doubting Thomas about intermittent fasting. I’m writing this as penance to correct questionable counsel I gave patients thousands of times It started as a gesture of empathy. A few weeks into the pandemic, with many reported to be starving, my wife and I thought it would be good to feel also what others had to struggle with—making do with just one, or at best, two meals a day, and dealing with the symptoms, like grumbling stomachs, dizziness and headaches due to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels). It required some adjustments in our eating routine. Although I usually skipped lunch previously at work, I would have a heavy breakfast, a 4 p.m. snack and a late heavy dinner. We canceled our breakfast, and reset our lunch to a late lunch, around 2 p.m. (which I occasionally stretch up to 6 p.m.) and just have one egg and fruits an hour before bedtime. Essentially it’s intermittent fasting, eating nothing solid for 16 to 20 hours, and just taking in food in a four- to eight-hour period. But during the fasting period, I would have two cups of black coffee, three glasses of plain tea, a glass of carrot juice and around a liter of water. Initially, when my stomach grumbled, I would drink a glass of water, and that sort of tricked my stomach into thinking that I took something, and the grumbling would stop. After a few weeks, my stomach had adjusted well to the new eating schedule, and was completely at peace with it. The headaches and lightheadedness were quite a challenge in the first few weeks, but just like my stomach, my other organs apparently adjusted later on, and I could go on a longer fast beyond 20 hours, if not for the importuning of my wife and our cook that the food was getting cold at the table, and the ants were starting to feast on it. What started as a sacrifice yielded palpable benefits, so we decided to continue doing it. I lost around 18 pounds in seven months. I wasn’t really overweight; in fact, I had a lean frame, but my abdominal fat, a good indication of my sweet tooth, was disproportionately bulging. From a size 36 waistline, it’s down to 32 inches. I used to take three antihypertensive pills. Now, my blood pressure is well controlled with just one pill. My blood sugar was mildly elevated, and I had to take an antidiabetic agent. My glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which is an indication of the previous three-month blood sugar levels, is down from 6.5 percent to 5.3 percent. I’ve reduced my antidiabetic pill, and if the blood sugar holds, I might stop it completely. My blood cholesterol levels have also never been this good. Despite my one-egg daily regimen, my good cholesterol increased to ideal levels, my bad cholesterol is down to very low levels, and my serum triglycerides are also well within normal limits. I have already reduced my dose of statin, my maintenance medicine for cholesterol. Subjectively, I think my brain function has also improved. Whereas before, I would fall asleep after reading one or two pages of scientific journals (hence, it was my sleep-inducing pill), now, I can finish reading several articles before feeling sleepy. My wife Becky, who’s the more conscientious health buff, says she notes similar benefits as I have. And it’s really consistent with what’s reported in the literature. I used to be a doubting Thomas about intermittent fasting (IF), mainly because of the age-old belief and injunction that we should eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a rich man and dinner like a pauper. Now, apparently, that was one of the questionable counsels I gave my patients thousands of times over the 35 years of my clinical practice. I’m writing this as penance to correct that. Although more studies are needed in humans, most of the current research in humans and experimental animals show consistently the beneficial effects on the body’s metabolism: better cellular and organ function, including that of the brain, heart and kidneys; prevention of cardiometabolic diseases like diabetes, elevated cholesterol levels and high blood pressure; possible prevention of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease; and enhanced longevity. Many of the benefits of IF can be attributed to changes in hormones, expression of our genes and functioning of our cells. Yes, we’re not stuck to what kind of genes we have; its final expression may vary, depending on the internal and external environment the genes are exposed to. So, one may have the gene predisposing him to a certain cancer, but if the hormonal (internal) environment plus the external environment (lifestyle) are favorably modified, the chance of the individual developing cancer is significantly reduced, and the cancer may not express or manifest at all.Because of the favorable hormonal effects IF has been shown to produce, the cells in our body also initiate important cellular repair processes. Another benefit of IF is the reduction of inflammation in the body. We may not be aware of it, but because of the so-called oxidative stress we get from the environment (air pollution, smoking, unhealthy lifestyle, stress, etc.), there’s an insidious process of inflammation or swelling taking place at the cellular level, causing the early degeneration of our organs, subsequently leading to disease and premature death. Data is now fairly robust that IF can effectively reduce oxidative damage and inflammation in the body, which can favorably impact against aging and development of the common lifestyle diseases, like cancer, heart, lung and brain diseases. Maintenance of brain function to prevent dementia, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease should be an appealing motivation for the middle-aged and seniors to try IF. The shift in metabolism from utilizing glucose, which is not really the best source of energy, to ketones, which is a more efficient energy source, is one of the major reasons for the many benefits of IF. IF can increase ketone levels much more effectively than a ketogenic diet. The body’s metabolism starts shifting to ketones after 12 hours of fasting, and this is enhanced further by the 16th hour and onward. So, should you go into IF? As a general rule, I would say it’s beneficial for most, but it’s best to consult your physicians first if you have health issues like diabetes and heart disease, and are taking medicines for it. You have to be closely supervised, and blood levels of certain parameters may need to be monitored to guide your doctor in the adjustment of your medicines. These health issues only require some monitoring precautions, but they are not contraindications to IF. In fact, IF may help partly control or treat these health problems, making possible a reduction in the doses of your medicines. Sustaining IF requires a strong will. Many give up in the first few weeks because of the symptoms they feel. Rather than give up altogether, I suggest you do it gradually as tolerated. Start with a 12-hour fast, and gradually increase it by an hour every three days. In four weeks, you’ll be on the prescribed 16-hour fast. An alternative would be to do it every other day at the start, then gradually increase it to a daily regimen. Just persevere, unless your doctor tells you to stop. Later on, you’ll realize that the long-term gains will prove to be well worth all the initial challenges.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Megaworld Lifestyle Malls and INQUIRER.net webinar series ‘Now is a Good Time’ concludes with final episode on October 30,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/373543/now-is-a-good-time-concludes-with-final-episode-on-october-30/,"02:48 PM October 28, 2020","The webinar series #NowIsAGoodTime of Megaworld Lifestyle Malls, in partnership with INQUIRER.net, present its final episode entitled as “#NowIsAGoodTime To Pamper Yourself and Your Pets” which will culminate on October 30, 2020 at 3:00PM.  The webinar series is hosted by TV personality, DJ, recording artist, and host of Adulting with Joyce podcast series, Joyce Pring who will go live via the Facebook of Megaworld Lifestyle Malls and its major properties, simultaneously with Inquirer.net Facebook’s live stream.

This advocacy will likewise invite customers to have their “me-time” at the mall (and give themselves rewards such as facial care, skin and hair treatments, and more) without them worrying for their health and safety because of the in-store sanitation protocols inside any of the pet-friendly Megaworld Lifestyle Malls.  Self-care is neither selfish nor frivolous, as all of us need a little indulgence like we deserve. The Covid-19 pandemic has caught us unguarded about dealing with the fear and the lockdown, thus, going back to the mall to make us feel refreshed and rejuvenated is one of the keys to giving yourself a break and create the proper life balance. And because going on vacations is still a far-fetched idea at the moment, indulging in Megaworld Lifestyle Malls’ myriad self-care options like facial spa, skin clinic and salons, gyms where you can sweat the toxins out while toning your body, and stores dedicated to pets and their needs is a surefire way to recharge—your own little way of supporting the country as it painstakingly trying to get the economy back on track.

Just like the two other episodes, this last one will take audiences deeper into how beauty and wellness, as well as pet care brands, while being ensured that all stores have innovated their brand of service, utilized revolutionary strategies in order to adapt and embrace the challenging times, in ways that will benefit all customers. Tefel Pesigan-Valentino, Megaworld Lifestyle Malls’ Vice President and Head of Marketing and Business Development, and the panel’s prime lead will extensively discuss how their malls (such as Eastwood Mall, Venice Grand Canal at McKinley Hill, Forbes Town, Newport Mall at Resorts World Manila, Uptown Mall, Southwoods Mall and Lucky Chinatown in Binondo) have collaborated with Safeguard, UV Care, and The Medical City to ensure quality sanitation and safety efforts. The UV Care, a certified brand trusted for its UV-sterilization, provided the malls with a more thorough and intensified disinfection, focusing on all facilities and high touchpoint areas. Tefel will also talk about their partnership with The Medical City, one of the country’s most trusted healthcare institutions, to guarantee an all-encompassing brand of safety that starts with its employees and extends to its valued customers. Megaworld Lifestyle Malls and this chief medical network were able to come up with comprehensive mall sanitation protocols that are supported by the medical industry insights and standards including hygiene, physical distancing, temperature check, and even environment cleaning including the malls’ waste disposal efforts. The alliance with Safeguard, a globally trusted brand when it comes to hygiene, particularly handwashing, has encouraged a culture of consistent and proper handwashing among mall and store employees and valued customers. Because of the partnership, Megaworld Lifestyle Malls has established Safeguard Stations at all restrooms across its lifestyle malls in the country. These Safeguard Stations contains Safeguard liquid antibacterial hand soaps to help remove germs and viruses. There are posters about proper handwashing techniques in restrooms that provide a visual guide of how to wash hands correctly. All these measures have been in place since Megaworld Lifestyle Malls reopened in May, and they have been educating and reminding the mall-goers that wearing face masks and face shield, proper physical distancing, and handwashing are the best measures that will complement their mall’s implementation of intensified sanitation and disinfection efforts. For your fido and feline that may have gotten used to hanging out in the mall, Megaworld Lifestyle Malls has an abundance of al fresco dining options. Megaworld Lifestyle Malls are the first-ever pet-friendly malls in the country, allowing dogs and cats to explore the malls together with their fur-parents.

Your mind can heal your body,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/373496/your-mind-can-heal-your-body/,"05:20 PM October 27, 2020","There are many examples of the awesome power of thought Have you ever thought of how powerful thought can be? We normally do not bother to think of what thought is, its nature and how it is created by us. A thought or idea is a product of our mind, our consciousness. It cannot be seen, heard, smelled, tasted or touched; it is ignored by mainstream Western science. They cannot even agree on how to define consciousness. Is consciousness merely the product of the chemical processes of the human brain? Is its existence dependent on the brain, or can it exist independent of the brain? No one has satisfactorily answered this question. Did our thought create the world of physical reality? But how can something so ethereal and incorporeal create something solid or material? That is the question. What has become so clear and undeniable from the science of quantum mechanics or quantum physics is that our mind, or consciousness or thought, can affect physical objects. The observer is not independent of the thing observed. The Buddhists may be right in saying that this world is a product of thought. We create our own reality. The outside world is an illusion they call “maya.” And the ancient Greek Philosopher, Plato, about a century and a half later, seemed to agree when he said that the physical world outside our mind is a mere shadow of the reality inside us. Other esoteric schools of thought carried this to the extreme when they declared that we “hallucinate” the world around us. In other words, the outside world is purely imaginary. There could be some truth to this seemingly outlandish and ridiculous idea, though. This reminds me of that old philosophical question: If a big tree falls in a forest but nobody is there to hear it, is there a sound? Let us leave that question to philosophers and drunks to debate on. How powerful is a thought? Well, it seems to me that nothing will exist in this world unless someone has thought of it. For example, before a table comes to exist, it must first exist in the mind of the carpenter. Before a painting appears on canvas, it must first appear in the mind of an artist or painter. And before the sun, the moon, the birds and the bees exist, they must first exist in the mind of a creator, whatever or whoever it is, for there can be no effect without a cause. This goes smack against the currently accepted Big Bang Theory and is, therefore, rejected by mainstream materialist science, except for a few theoretical physicists like Sir James Jeans, who declared, “This world is beginning to look more like a big thought than a big machine.” Another British physicist, Sir Stanley Eddington, seemed to agree when he declared that “The stuff of the universe is mind stuff.” How powerful, then, is thought? Well, it has been shown that thought can heal, but it can also kill. One can think of or visualize a sickness, and if done properly, can make it disappear. Thought coupled with strong intention can change the molecular structure of water and even heal wounds of mice, as shown in various controlled scientific experiments conducted by Dr. William Tiller of Stanford University and also by biologist Bernard Grad. The Japanese researcher Masaro Emoto proved that thoughts or words uttered before a container of water can change the molecular structure of water. Great healers around the world, like Ze Arigo of Brazil, Tony Agpaoa of the Philippines, and Olga Worrrall and Oscar Estebany of the United States, have proved the efficacy of the healing touch, coupled with the intention to heal the patient. And Dr. Larry Dossey has proven, through scientific experiments, that prayer, even if done from afar, has the power to heal the sick. In a seminar I conducted before public school educators and local government officials in Cagayan de Oro in the early ’90s, I told participants to visualize or create a mental image of their sickness, and imagine it disappearing or dissipating. I put the participants first in a restful, meditative state, with alpha brain waves. One female school superintendent had a small but painful cyst on her knee. This lady imagined she was extracting the cyst with a knife and saw it come out in her imagination. After that session, her cyst disappeared completely, to her great surprise. I can cite here many more examples of the power of thought or imagery to cure an illness. But I think the above examples will suffice to convince us of how powerful thoughts are. So, remember, if you think you are sick, even if you’re not, then you will get sick. And the opposite is also true. If you think yourself healthy and strong, you will be healthy and strong, depending on how vividly you create this image in your mind. This will not work unless done under proper conditions and state of mind, and repeated several times. Email [email protected]; visit www.innermindlearning.com.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
A Holistic Practice: Options Studio to Open Its Doors in Shangri-La Mall,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/373380/a-holistic-practice-options-studio-to-open-its-doors-in-shangri-la-mall/,"02:24 PM October 26, 2020","With all the chaos brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been finding different ways to cope and maintain their well-being. Some find comfort in starting a journal, some video-chat with their friends, and some resort to working out. It is known that movement and exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety. According to an article published by Harvard, exercising regularly can bring positive changes to your body, heart, metabolism, and spirit. Not only will your self-confidence improve, but it will also reduce your body’s stress hormones. There are many exercise options out there, depending on what you want to focus on, but if you’re searching for a more holistic practice then Pilates is the right fit for you. In the 1920s, Joseph Pilates designed a body exercise system to “strengthen the weak and challenge the strong”. He firmly believed that mental and physical health are interconnected. Since then, it has been popularly practiced worldwide. Marivic Del Pilar, a Pilates enthusiast, has been doing this regimen for 11 years now. Because of the positive results that she experienced from doing Pilates, she decided to open her own studio. “I have been doing Pilates for many years now.  I have grown to love it because I felt the beneficial effects of it on my health.  The more toned physique was just the bonus and a side effect, actually a pilates workout is almost similar to a physical therapy or rehab session,” she shares. “Because I believe in it, I want to share the wonderful effects of it with more people. Thus, the opening of my own studio.”  The top option Options Studio is the first and only international chain of Pilates and Movement Studios worldwide, with another Philippine branch opening on November 1 in Shangri-La Mall. It is also the only studio in the metro that is fully equipped with Gratz Classical Pilates Equipment, the industry standard for authentic Pilates equipment. Master Trainer and Founder of Options Studio Ole Eugenio personally facilitates the training with the studio’s movement specialists. “Stretch to your strength with Pilates!”, he would always say. Aside from being the creator of the Core Suspend and Core Reform from the systems of Smart Movement®, Eugenio is also the first Filipino to be certified in Stott Pilates in Toronto, Canada. To date, he has trained more than 500 Pilates instructors all over the world; at Options, he trains alongside with Pilates Mentors Camille Joson-Ordinario and Neil Alvarez. Options Studio offers a range of exercises for everyone — from the different methods with different specializations like Pilates for Sports, Leisure, and Lifestyle, and Postural Correction and Rehabilitation. They currently have the following programs: Core Reform, Core Suspend, Core Barre, Rebound, Core Chair, Pre-natal and Post-Natal, Traditional Mat, and Traditional Reformer. Benefits that people can enjoy from consistent Pilates practice include better posture and alignment, reduced back pain from tension from working at home, increased flexibility, improved balance and coordination, and improved circulation. This “intelligent” exercise also boosts the immune system and releases endorphins, best for helping ease the body and mind amid the stresses of these unprecedented times.  Options for extra safety With the pandemic still ongoing, Options Studio’s top priority is the safety of their clients. Social distancing will still be practiced. Cleaning and disinfecting the studio will also be conducted several times a day. Clients are also given the option to do an online session with movement specialists and do it in the comfort of their own homes. Bookings can be made through Options Studio’s Facebook page at OptionsStudio Shangri-la, or by sending a DM on their Instagram at @optionsstudioshang. When asked what Del Pilar’s message to people who are feeling unmotivated to move because of the COVID-19 pandemic, she says, “Movement and exercise can help increase their immunity and strength. If they cannot go out, they can easily have Pilates at home through our zoom group and private classes.” “The more we are kept at home, the more we need movement specialists to help us move and keep us healthy. Pilates is not just for the body, but it is also for the mind, the bones, the lymphatic system, and body stability. The more we are able to control our body, the stronger we become physically, mentally, and in terms of immunity.” Options Studio’s soft opening is on November 1 in Shangri-La Mall, Main Wing, Level 5. Their other studios are located all over Metro Manila, in the following areas: Makati, Alabang, BGC, Timog Avenue, and “Move With Options” Rockwell. They also have a partner studio in Cebu called “Pilates Fit”. For inquiries, you may contact them through 0917-813-0296 or [email protected]. ADVT  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
"Gummies, dried fruits and masks for kids with cancer",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/372569/gummies-dried-fruits-and-masks-for-kids-with-cancer/,"01:36 PM October 13, 2020","For over three years now, Filipino brand Honest Junk has been serving delicious, healthy and affordable snacks. “Our first goal was to junk people’s perceptions of what healthy tastes like,” said Celine Gabriel Lim, who created Honest Junk with Tina Lagdameo. “So many people think that if something is good for you, it probably tastes bad. We wanted to debunk this.” Honest Junk’s products are made using “natural and mindful ingredients” and are lower in sugar, low sodium, gluten-free, preservative-free, fortified with superfoods and contain no artificial colors or flavors. They also offer vegan options. Lim and Lagdameo made sure they kept their products affordable. Lim said, “Healthy food is usually expensive. So we created products most people could afford because we wanted to encourage them to make better choices for themselves.” Lim calls their Honest Junk’s Super Gummies “probably the healthiest gummy bear snacks.” The gummies, which come in fruit flavors, are fortified with moringa (malunggay). “We sweeten our gummy bears with natural juice and coconut sugar—no refined sugar. Malunggay is one of the most powerful superfoods in the world and it’s so abundant,” said Lim. Cheese Barks, thin and crisp cheesy crackers fortified with superfoods, are made using artisanal cheese from Malagos Farms in Mindanao. The Super Cookies are vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, low-sugar and -sodium, and fortified with superfoods. Lagdameo’s favorite is the cocoa nib variants—their healthier take on chocolate chip cookies. The cocoa nibs are also sourced from Malagos Farms. Like all other businesses, the pandemic has affected Honest Junk but that hasn’t stopped the brand from serving their customers and wanting to make a difference. “It’s been a difficult year for most of us, but, yet again, Filipinos have displayed their resilience, courage, kindness, empathy and fortitude,” said Lim. “We felt so inspired by the bayanihan spirit that we felt moved to create a special product inspired by this very wonderful trait.” They just introduced Love Local, their popular Super Gummies mixed with bite-sized dried fruit that come in special packs. The packs feature artwork by Honest Junk’s graphic artist Maysie Lagman that was inspired by the outpouring of generosity they’ve seen from Filipinos during the pandemic. And here’s the beautiful thing—for every pack of Love Local sold, Honest Junk will donate a mask to Kythe Foundation for children battling cancer. Lim said, “I’ve been supporting Kythe Foundation for many years. They put in so much heart into what they do … Children with cancer are one of the most vulnerable to the virus, so the idea clicked easily in my head.” Honest Junk has partnered with Wholly Scrap!, which provides work for displaced Filipino seamstresses. “The masks that will be donated to the children of Kythe are made with upcycled material and handmade with love,” said Candy de Ocampo Pacla. Just like Honest Junk, Wholly Scrap! is the result of a partnership between friends, Pacla and Joycelyn Victoria. Pacla, whose father Benny de Ocampo is the founder of the 55-year-old Exclusively His Tailoring business, had long observed how much fabric was being thrown away from their 12 branches. After finding out how much time it takes for fabric to decompose, she decided to find ways to use the excess fabric from their shops. “I thought that something needed to be done. I have children, and I thought about what their future would be like with all the environmental problems.” Victoria’s parents both battled cancer—her father went through radiation and chemotherapy and eventually succumbed to the disease, while her mother went for alternative treatment and has been cancer-free for more than seven years now. It was their fight against the disease and her love for the environment that made Victoria switch to a plant-based diet, use products made from natural ingredients and consciously and conscientiously segregate trash. “I dream of a cleaner environment for future generations, for them to be able to enjoy clean sea waters and cleaner air,” she said. Wholly Scrap! is the result of their combined passion for the environment. Their seamstresses have been using Japan cotton fabric scraps from Exclusively His Tailoring and meticulously sewing them into masks. “The material is of good quality and the fit, especially for kids ages 2-3 years old, provides good coverage. Our masks also have side pockets to accommodate the cloth filter which is designed to be breathable,” said Pacla. Their seamstresses are displaced workers from other companies. The more Wholly Scrap! products sold, the more seamstresses they can help. “Each purchase of Wholly Scrap! products is also a way of supporting our advocacy of upcycling, repurposing and contributing to helping the environment recover from everyday abuse, especially now with the production of disposable masks and gloves and the use of plastic wraps, adhesive tapes and plastic bags as a result of the pandemic,” said Pacla and Victoria. The women of Honest Junk and Wholly Scrap! believe that now is a time for supporting homegrown brands and products. “Let’s all try and help our local economy. We really need to boost not only the Philippine trade and commerce, but also the morale of the Filipinos,” said Pacla. For Love Local packs: myhonestjunk.com, email [email protected], text tel. no.

Trump’s ‘shotgun treatment’ for COVID-19,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/372565/trumps-shotgun-treatment-for-covid-19/,"01:13 PM October 13, 2020","We’re so relieved that US President Donald Trump has been declared recovering well from COVID-19; in fact, he’s considered fit and noninfective enough to go back on the campaign trail in a few days. When the world’s most powerful person’s life hangs in the balance because of a potentially fatal disease, the whole world is in suspended animation. The suspense is now over, and we go back to regular programming. Several have texted me to ask if Trump’s medical team pressed the panic button and gave him a shotgun treatment, including experimental ones. We’re not really in any position to assess the rationale for his treatment regimen, but the bottom line is that he didn’t experience any serious side effect, and seems to have recovered well. Based on his official medical bulletins, he received a monoclonal antibody cocktail (MAC), steroids, remdesivir, melatonin, famotidine, zinc and vitamin D. I’d just like to discuss the three treatments now on clinical trials, hence, considered experimental—the MAC, melatonin and famotidine. The MAC is a combination of two antibodies, one coming from a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and the other from a mouse, with a genetically engineered immune system simulating that of humans. The antibody cocktail targets the spike protein of the virus to deactivate it and prevent it from replicating exponentially inside the cells. Experimental studies in animals—hamsters and monkeys—have shown it could potentially reduce the virus levels and disease severity. Just two weeks ago, the manufacturer of the cocktail presented preliminary data from its ongoing clinical trial on COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic or, at most, moderate disease. The results of the preliminary data suggested that those given it required fewer medical visits, but it showed no clear evidence that it could prevent progression to more severe disease. Trump, who was assessed to have mild COVID-19, would have fit into the enrollment criteria for the clinical trial. However, giving him this experimental treatment, the immediate and long-term side effects of which are not known yet, was a bit of a medical gamble on a person whose health outcome would have impacted the whole world. For me, the risk-versus-benefit balance tilted more on the risk side. Famotidine is a common antihyperacidity or heartburn remedy. A clinical trial testing the drug on hospitalized COVID-19 patients in New York suggested it might be helpful, but since they were not able to recruit the necessary number of patients, their results were not statistically significant. The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, which initiated the trial, is embarking on another trial on milder cases of COVID-19. This drug has been around for decades and is established to be safe. So, I would have no qualms, too, about giving Trump this drug. After all, he was also on steroids, which can cause upset stomach, so famotidine can help prevent this, too. He was also given melatonin, a commonly available sleep-aid supplement, but the dose was unspecified. It is presumed to be higher than the usual recommended dose given for sleep enhancement. Two colleagues based in the United States sent me messages that the medical team may have referred to our published preliminary report on the use of high-dose melatonin (hdM) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.High-dose melatonin The report, “Melatonin as adjuvant treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia patients requiring hospitalization (MAC-19 PRO): a case series,” reported on 10 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, admitted at the Manila Doctors Hospital on the first month of the pandemic here, to whom we gave hdM. We published our preliminary experience in a US journal last June, and the editor acknowledged it in his editorial as the first published report on the use of high-dose melatonin in actual COVID-19 patients. In the report, our observation was that patients given hdM—compared to patients who were not given hdM (non-hdM) during the same study period from March 5 to April 4, 2020—showed benefits in terms of recovery, prevention of more severe disease and possibly survival. In all 10 patients given hdM, clinical stabilization and/or improvement was noted within four to five days. All hdM patients, including three with moderately severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)—which is the main cause of death in COVID-19—and one with mild ARDS, survived. None required intubation and mechanical ventilation (MV), or being hooked to a respirator or breathing machine. The patients given hdM were discharged at an average of around eight days after initiation of hdM, compared to the 13 days average hospital stay in those not given hdM. To provide perspective, although the groups were not comparable, 12 of the 34 (35.3 percent) COVID-19 (positive) by swab test non-hdM patients admitted during the same period died, and seven (20.6 percent) required MV, while six of 15 (40 percent) non-hdM (negative) by swab test but highly probable COVID-19 pneumonia patients also died, and four (26.7percent) required MV. No significant side effects were noted with hdM except for sleepiness, which was deemed favorable by all patients, most of whom had anxiety- and symptom-related sleeping problems previously. We concluded in the report that “hdM may have a beneficial role in patients treated for COVID-19 pneumonia, in terms of shorter time to clinical improvement, less need for MV, shorter hospital stay and possibly lower risk of death. HdM was well tolerated. This is the first report describing the benefits of hdM in patients being treated for COVID-19 pneumonia. Being a commonly available and inexpensive sleep-aid supplement worldwide, melatonin may play a role as adjuvant therapy in the global war against COVID-19.” A well-designed nationwide clinical trial on hdM in COVID-19 is now underway, spearheaded by noted lung specialist Dr. Camilo Roa Jr. It’s funded by the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development, and with this trial, we hope to validate what were observed in the preliminary report. Everything is set for the trial; the study group is just awaiting final approval from our Food and Drug Administration. Last month, a group of local and foreign experts, including four former Department of Health secretaries (Doctors Enrique Ona, Jimmy Galvez-Tan, Manuel Dayrit and Paulyn Ubial), also came out with a consensus recommendation for the use of hdM in COVID-19, from the confirmed but asymptomatic cases to the critically ill cases. This was circularized here and in the United States. Our US colleagues say Trump’s medical team might have gotten hold of this report, too. So, of the three experimental treatments Trump received, I believe giving melatonin and famotidine had results that were high-benefit (especially melatonin) and low-risk.

"In new book, Gideon Lasco ponders big questions of nationhood",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/372536/in-new-book-gideon-lasco-ponders-big-questions-of-nationhood/,"02:49 PM October 12, 2020","Inquirer columnist offers a complicated answer in wry, insightful ‘The Philippines Is Not a Small Country’ “What does it mean to be a Filipino, and what is a meaningful basis for taking pride in the nation,” asks Gideon Lasco in the introduction to his new book, “The Philippines Is Not a Small Country” (Ateneo de Manila University Press, Quezon City, 2020, 234 pages). “What is our place in the world—and how should we envision a future we can all share?” Lasco, 34, has demonstrated a gifted writing style, proven not only by a Palanca Award in the Essay in English but in his outspoken, highly opinionated column in the Inquirer, the pithily titled “Second Opinion.” But Lasco is also a medical doctor (Intarmed at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine), research fellow (Ateneo) and an anthropologist (PhD from the University of Amsterdam). “The Philippines Is Not a Small Country” contains parts of essays Lasco wrote for the Inquirer over five years but he has built a narrative around those essays that is divided into seven digestible chapters. In “Country,” Lasco deconstructs the Philippines to show how it “is as vast as it is beautiful.” In “Nation,” he talks about how the Philippines is “a young country” and how Filipinos need more empathy to deal with life. “Culture” talks about the social constructs that make up our unique worldview. In “People,” he explores the spectrum of marginalized individuals who make up the population. “Technology” and “Modernity,” wired together, essentially comment on how both have changed Filipino society for good or ill. And the final chapter, “World,” literally discusses our place in the world, how the country is not apart but a part of the larger community. Lasco’s writing is polished and impressive but “The Philippines Is Not a Small Country” is no rah-rah jingoist volume. It is a reflection of a flawed and complex people, how we became that way, and that, pointed in the right direction, the country has much to look forward to. It’s good that he knows how to do it in such an accessible fashion. Lasco cuts up the narrative into interesting, often funny but also insightful bite-sized pieces. Take the sections where he discusses “Bawal Umihi Dito,” our obsession with height, Instagramming food, why nobody tells bedtime stories anymore. In the final chapter, he has a beautiful essay that ends: “We begin to overcome the feeling of smallness that sets back our geopolitical imagination. What our past should give us is not an enmity for those who oppressed us but an empathy for those who experienced oppression. What our past should give us is neither a feeling of victimization nor entitlement but a dignity of a people that has suffered much—but has overcome more.” But he’s been writing throughout all that intense studying. “I’ve been scribbling essays since high school as part of school papers; I managed to publish in the much-sought-after Young Blood column on both ends of my medical training.” Lasco started contributing regularly to the Opinion section in 2015. In fact, he is already an author. “In 2016, I published a hiking guidebook titled ‘Dayhikes and Nature Walks from Manila,’ but this is my first book as a writer of national affairs.” Additionally, his unique combination of disciplines (writer/medical doctor/anthropologist) gives him an advantage: “Being a doctor I think makes me sensitive to health issues, while being an anthropologist makes me conscious of the need to bring out not just my perspective, but those of the people I encounter.” But to get to those seven chapters, Lasco didn’t sit in his room and reflect on the nature of nationhood—he went out there and traveled from province to province to experience what his fellow Filipinos are experiencing. It has not been all thrills and discoveries. “I guess the saddest—if not the most shocking—thing is that some of the things I wrote in 2016 or 2017 could have been written today, almost word for word, especially as regards political issues like the drug war, corruption and our divisive politics. I hope that 10 years from now, when we look back, we would have made some progress, and that we need not defend fundamental matters like human rights.”  He wanted to compile his columns but also make a book agile enough to still be relevant. He broached the idea of Karina Bolasco, Ateneo Press director, at a 2018 conference in Hiroshima. He worked hard on the book and Ateneo Press continued to work on it through the COVID-19 pandemic. There were insights that he came to possess from writing the book. “Acknowledging the complexity of the Filipino should always be the starting point for thinking, and writing, about them,” he said. In his recent columns, Lasco has been outspoken about his criticism of how the government has been handling the different crises the Filipinos have faced. How then to solve those problems? “It is indeed an impossible question but part of the answer is justice: We have not really held our leaders and their enablers accountable, allowing them to escape, lie low and then resurface to do more mischief. In my essay ‘Memory as resistance,’ I stress the importance of fine-grained memory because tyranny is not built by one man alone; it takes a village.” He also emphasizes that we must not lose hope. “Some of our leaders’ actions and inaction can drive us to despair but we have Filipinos from all walks of life trying their best to do good in this difficult time: from entrepreneurs to medical front-liners.” He has new books lined up: “a more academic book about the meanings of human stature, as well as an edited volume on drug use, the drug war and drug policy in the country. And I really hope I can write about my hikes.” “The Philippines Is Not a Small Country” is an intelligent, accessible and actually funny book about what it means to be Filipino—even though it’s a complicated answer. Gideon Lasco makes it easy for you—but you still have to answer the question, as he did in the introduction: “I was especially mindful of young Filipinos, many of whom are unsure as to what the future brings, uncertain as to what to make of their national identity, and unclear as to how to critically engage with our nation’s problems. Ultimately, my earnest wish is that these essays will convey the fact that, indeed, the Philippines is not a small country, and despite the many challenges we face, our nation and its promise are larger than many of us imagine them to be.” Available in paperback from the Ateneo de Manila University Press, Lazada and Shopee.

Bernal talked about her efforts in making her restaurant in Banawe, Quezon City a safe place to dine in during the pandemic, via her Instagram account yesterday, Oct. 4. “TBH, so much effort, time, and money I had put and invested to @houseofgogiph to comply with the new normal health and safety protocols. The future of dine-in is so complex!” she said, posting a photo of her and fiancé Perry Choi while inside the restaurant. She profusely thanked her “awesome followers” who helped her in promoting her businesses. “Our dine-in service at @houseofgogiph was in full capacity this weekend! I know you are all scared to go out because the virus is still around! I know you are all thinking twice before deciding to dine in!! Thank you so much for trusting me, trusting us!” she said. Bernal also talked about how she was able to deal with mental stress. “During these tough times, only my family and my fiancé know every single detail of the mental battles I encounter daily. I can’t thank them enough too for keeping my mind in the game,” she said. In July, Bernal decided to temporarily close her Korean barbecue restaurant to prioritize the safety of her staff.

Guanio demonstrated how to make a yummy pasta dish using leftover prawns, mushrooms and noodles, plus a sauce made up of ginger, garlic, spring onions and shallots, as seen on her YouTube vlog on Oct. 2. At the same time, she spoke about her advocacy. “When the pandemic hit and affected a lot of our kababayans, I started a series of cooking videos called ‘Loving Your Leftovers’ and posted them on my Instagram and Youtube channel,” she said. “I wanted people to know that with a little bit of ingenuity and willingness to try something new, you can still eat healthy, yummy meals that won’t break the bank. It is dedicated to teach people how to be sustainable [diners].” Guanio explained the importance of sustainable living because everything on Earth is “finite.” “In other words, the plants, animals and natural resources that we use for food and living will run out if we don’t think about propagating and caring for them,” she explained. “And we also know by now that what we do and use on this earth now has a lot of long-term impact on the planet, other people and our future especially the next generations.” Guanio encouraged her fans and subscribers to join in her cause. “By donating to this link you will be part of educating 100 students about [the] inter-relationship of various components in the environment as well as different wildlife species and their habitats,” she said. “At a young age, they will be taught how to integrate caring for the environment with other aspects of their lives.”  Guanio then stressed that “education is very important in inspiring people to action.” “By helping provide much-needed environmental education to the young Filipinos, you are helping us, change the ending for our country and the planet,” she said, noting that one would also be helping in potentially preventing future pandemics from happening.

COVID-19 pandemic: The dangers of drinking solo,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/371930/covid-19-pandemic-the-dangers-of-drinking-solo/,"04:35 PM October 01, 2020"," SEOUL — More South Koreans are drinking unaccompanied in the comfort of their homes since the novel coronavirus pandemic began. A September report on local alcohol beverage markets by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs showed that for 87.3 percent of consumers surveyed, home was their primary place of drinking and 45.2 percent said they were drinking alone. Kang Sang-yun, 28, is part of that demographic. He said he’d barely gone out for drinks since QR-coded ID became mandatory at pubs and bars few months ago. “It just feels like too much of a bother. Plus, beer is cheaper at grocery stores.” While he described himself as “not an alcoholic by any means,” he said he found himself drinking more after work when he would have been doing something else had it not for the coronavirus. For Kang, it’s the pandemic ennui that seems to be pushing him toward boozing. Being responsible and complying with social distancing rules means more time sitting idle. “I drink out of boredom mostly. Now, a can or two of beer is how I wrap up the day.” Experts warn that drinking habits established during the pandemic are likely to undermine people’s psychological and physical well-being. Drinking in solitude is a bad way of coping with the coronavirus gloom, according to psychiatrist Dr. Koo Ja-hyun at a hospital in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province. “Oftentimes, I see patients resorting to alcohol use as a form of self-medication,” he said. “Drinking initially causes a rush of feel-good hormones known as dopamine. For people who are looking to turn a bad mood around, it can be tempting to indulge in that immediate gratification.” Using alcohol to feel better is like drinking seawater to quench one’s thirst, he said. “When you start falling repeatedly for the compulsive need for instant payoffs, an addiction is established.” Koo also pointed out that alcohol dependence is seldom a standalone condition. “People with depression or otherwise struggling mentally are more likely to engage in problem drinking. If you’re in an emotionally vulnerable state, avoid relying on alcohol as a coping mechanism.” Drinking on one’s own rather than socially also creates conditions that are more conducive to abuse, according to addiction psychiatrist Dr. Lee Deok-jong at Severance Hospital in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province. “Drinking context and motives matter,” he said. “I think a fundamental question that needs to be addressed is why someone might be drinking by himself or herself in the first place. When you drink alone, you’re often drinking for the sake of drinking — as opposed to in a group setting when your purpose is largely for socializing.” As for solo drinkers who may believe they are capable of enjoying the experience without harming themselves, Lee said a penchant for drinking isn’t the same as a love of food. “The bottom line is that alcoholic drinks are an addictive substance. Too many risks are being ignored in making drinking at home and when out alone to be a normal, daily activity or habit,” he said. Besides, the notion of healthy drinking is a myth, according to gastroenterologist Dr. Park Joong-won of the National Cancer Center. “There is no such thing as safe or healthy alcohol consumption,” said Park, who is the principal scientist at the hospital’s Center for Liver and Pancreatobiliary Cancer. The World Health Organization classifies alcohol as a carcinogen, for one thing, he said. Excessive alcohol use can also lead to serious and potentially life-threatening health outcomes such as liver cirrhosis, heart disease, stroke and neuropsychiatric conditions, including Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. Even moderate drinking, contrary to popular belief, carries serious health risks. “Frequent drinking in moderate amounts can be worse than occasional heavy drinking in that it doesn’t give the liver time to recover,” Park said. “The media portrayal normalizing and romanticizing the act of drinking alone without due warning is incredibly irresponsible,” he said. “I think television plays a big role in promoting solitary drinking as not just acceptable but cool, a fashionable lifestyle or pastime. I worry that such depictions can influence drinking tendencies among young people.” The WHO has warned of the dangers of increased consumption of alcohol during lockdown. The agency said in an online statement that alcohol can worsen health vulnerabilities and increase the risk of injury and violence, and encouraged governments to take steps to reduce harm associated with its use. Another addiction specialist, Dr. Roh Sung-won of Hanyang University Hospital in Seoul, said alcohol intake should not exceed 20 to 40 grams per day. (Two small glasses of wine provide about 20 grams.) But that’s a warning for problem drinkers and not an invitation to engage in “moderate” drinking, which is still not advisable, he stressed. Also, a more significant indicator of dependence than quantity is loss of control. “If you have to drink, drink mindfully and keep track of how much you’re drinking. Notice how it’s affecting your mood, thoughts, behaviors. Drink slowly and with food and water.”    CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020

Thus, private and government sectors have been working together to support both learners and teachers. AKAP Guro CONNECTed is one of such working initiatives that have brought together teachers in its fold to engage, inspire, and empower them for they are the ones who do the same to the students. AKAP Guro CONNECTed is a program of Unilab, Inc. through its External Affairs Division, in collaboration with several partners.  It launched its webinar series in Inquirer.net last week with representatives from the Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Education (DepEd), and the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA). The main platform for its advocacy is a series of webinars about health, including the latest about COVID-19, and other initiatives that are geared toward increasing compliance of students and the teaching community to minimum health standards to avoid further spread of the virus most especially among the children and the youth.

Schools have been strictly advised to comply with minimum health standards and DOH’s required health standards as well. About 900,000 teachers and 23 million students will start classes in public schools on October 5. “We are putting in place protection measures for employees especially since the work-from-home setup has become more demanding, with no delineation anymore between household chores and work,” said the DepEd director. Department of Health (DoH) emphasized that everyone can be part of the solution. “We are all called to be the solution. We are not a slave to COVID-19, the solution is in our hands. We are not helpless,” said Dr. Beverly Lorraine Ho from the DoH Health Promotion & Communication Service, who talked about BIDA Solusyon, a campaign of the DOH. Dr. Ho cited that the Philippines’ self-reported compliance is high. “We still have challenges in terms of compliance but more and more Filipinos are doing the protocols. She said those in positions of power should not only ensure strict compliance but to make sure that materials that people need to comply with are available such as face masks, alcohol, water, soap, etc. Pediatric experts Dr. Maria Angela Nicole S. Perreras and Dr. Maria Cristina I. Alberto emphasized the teachers’ key role in instilling health protocols to their students, who follow them as figures of authority. Dr. Perreras, a pediatric infectious diseases practitioner, does teleconsulting a lot and observed that it has become fairly common for whole families getting infected with Covid-19. “I guide parents on how to quarantine family members properly and when they have to go to the hospital for routine treatment or wellness vaccination, we make sure it will be safe for them,” she said. Dr. Alberto, a community pediatrician in Cavite and founder of Hope in Me Club, cited that even when children are inside their homes, many still contract vaccine-preventable diseases, so she urges parents to still consult doctors or health centers. She also reminded teachers to keep themselves fit and healthy through proper diet and exercise. “We cannot just passively watch cases on TV. We should keep busy boosting our health. For instance, children should exercise at least one hour a day and adults at least 30 minutes a day. We should be ready and prepare our bodies to be strong enough, because the virus is around us,” she said. Both doctors, who are part of the AKAP Guro CONNECTed Advisory Council, said that AKAP Guro CONNECTed webinars have been instrumental in levelling up the preparation of the teaching community since its launch last June 2020. The reminders and messages of the webinar’s resource speakers are tied together by the launch of a 60-second video produced by the Philippine Educational Theatre Association (PETA) featuring an original jingle composed by Noel Cabangon and Michelle Ngu entitled “Sugpuin, COVID 19”.  Copies will be sent to schools with a Teachers’ Manual that can serve as a creative material for teachers to help in inculcating the value of the minimum health standards among students. “As artists, we in PETA believe that arts is a potent tool to affect the consciousness and behavior of an individual. Arts is not just to express but to advocate very important messages. We use our arts to make people aware,” said Melvin Lee, Program Director of PETA. Lea Espallardo, Curriculum Director and Facilitator at PETA, presented the Teacher’s Guide for elementary and junior/senior high school teachers on how to cascade the message of the video effectively for students who belong to different grades and levels. “It’s important to reiterate that compliance of everyone to the minimum health standards is a must. Ensuring the safety of everyone starts with us, not just with the doctors as they are our last line of defense.  We are the first line of defense—our habits and compliance to the protocols,” said Espallardo. AKAP Guro CONNECTed is presented by Unilab, Inc. and RiteMed Tamang Alaga.  It is supported by Catholic Education Association of the Philippines (CEAP), Visayan Youth Matters and Now You Know.

Realizations and lessons learned from COVID-19,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/371132/realizations-and-lessons-learned-from-covid-19/,"12:34 PM September 21, 2020","When the COVID-19 pandemic quickly swept the world, it became apparent to all of us that our frequent five-minute handwashing and wearing of surgical face masks wouldn’t be enough to keep everyone safe. To contain the spread of the virus, we were told to stay home or stay six feet apart. And just like that, life as we know it came to a near-halt. Months after Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), and with no vaccine in sight, we can’t say how long till we return to our normal routines. But we can all find comfort in the fact that we’re dealing with this pandemic together, and we’ll overcome it in the same way. Life as we know it might change forever but we can go on, worry-free, if we stay informed and prepare for the future.  Because while the future is uncertain, we can always take steps to prepare today so we can worry less tomorrow. COVID-19 has affected our lives in different ways but the lessons we learned from it are essentially the same. Here are five lessons everyone learned or should learn, especially now that most of us are finally back to work. Your health is your best asset—both physically and financially. Pandemic or not, protecting your health always comes first. And having good health and being in shape give you more energy to work hard for your family while pursuing your passions. Staying healthy saves you a lot of money too. After all, getting sick is not cheap. You have to pay for medicines, treatment, and confinement. Costs for COVID-19 treatment can reach millions, and so do other critical illnesses like cancer, heart attack, renal failure, or stroke. But if you do get sick (and often these illnesses will just strike without warning), there are ways to make sure you are financially prepared. Protection plans like FWD Insurance’s Set for Health ensure that you have the money you need to pay for any medical bills. It allows you to claim up to three times against major critical illnesses—and if you remain healthy by 75 years old, you’ll get your money back. For years, we’ve been told to wash our hands properly. But we never really took it that seriously. Until this year. Now, it’s one of the best lines of defense against COVID-19. With most of us being called back to work or allowed to go outside, handwashing or sanitizing our hands are even more important. Let’s not forget to regularly disinfect and clean our homes either. Other precautionary measures we learned recently leaving our shoes outside, showering and changing into new clothes immediately, and storing dirty laundry in disposable bags. It’s a good idea to have a rainy-day fund to cover expenses in case of emergencies.  This is all the more relevant today during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the saying goes: hope for the best but prepare for the worst.  Financial planning is important, especially if you’re the breadwinner. Life insurance plans like FWD’s Set for Tomorrow make sure that your family has the financial means to go on, protecting them from unpaid loans and sudden income loss due to death. OFWs who work abroad get additional protection, too.   This year we’ve seen how the right information can actually save lives. From patients’ travel histories to accurate, science-based news about masks and social distancing. But a lot of information is still out there, and not all of it is checked.  So when reading the news, check the source. Is it from a reputable channel, agency, or publication? Are the statistics and studies from credible research or government organizations? Let’s all be vigilant in spotting fake news. The pandemic has showed many of us how extremely dependent we are on our paychecks and daily earnings. With no work or income for more than a month, a lot of us have struggled to make both ends meet. And this will continue with businesses laying off workers and instituting a “no work, no pay” policy. That’s why it’s important to be financially prepared and have a financial safety net so you can get through any emergency. It’s not too late to start securing your financial future today. Save. Invest. Protect. VUL plans like FWD’s Set for Life allows exactly that. You get both insurance and investment and pay for it monthly. You get to grow your money and, at the same time, secure your future – and your family’s. COVID-19 is a call for preparedness for everyone. The pandemic took us by surprise, but we learned some valuable lessons. Now that we know better, we can prepare better—physically, mentally, and financially. FWD Insurance is one of the few insurance companies that are digitally ready to help you financially prepare for the future. Its financial advisors are available to talk to you about your finances and help you with your financial goals via video chat or whatever channel is more convenient for you.

This conversation has been edited for clarity.   “I’ve just been taking it day by day, to be honest.  At the beginning of the pandemic, I was experiencing a lot of fear and anxiety but eventually learned how to deal with it through constant prayer and meditation.  “Now, I focus my time and energy on doing inner work like practicing yoga and meditation everyday as well as taking care of my physical body by exercising at the gym and eating a purely plant-based diet.  “I’ve been using this time to focus on my personal growth and hopefully become more resilient so that I will be prepared for whatever challenges that may arise.   “My husband Rob and I wake up at 4 a.m. every morning to be able to practice yoga and meditation for a couple of hours to start our day.  “Personally, it’s my quiet time when I can check in with myself and see how I’m doing on the inside, while at the same time take care of my physical body.  “This is also the time when I pray and talk to God. I thank Him for the gift of life, for always guiding me in my journey and for giving me peace in my heart. I also ask Him for protection for my husband and our families in the Philippines as well as healing for all living beings who need it during this global pandemic.  “After I finish my morning practice, I read some of my favorite books such as ‘The Power of Now’ and ‘A New Earth’ by Eckhart Tolle and ‘Autobiography of a Yogi’ by Paramahansa Yogananda.   “I have brunch at around 11 a.m., get some work done online and then head to the gym with Rob for a short workout at 1 p.m. After that, we have lunch at our place and have some coffee and tea after.  “In the afternoon, we run some errands like have our laundry done or get groceries. At around 4-5 p.m., we practice some more yoga and meditation to be able to check in with ourselves again.  “We then have a light dinner at around 6 p.m. and then afterwards do some more reading, go on social media and/or watch some of our favorite TV shows! I’ve been enjoying K-Drama shows during this lockdown. I am currently watching Reply 1988 after finishing Reply 1997 and Reply 1994.  “By 8 p.m., we are both ready for bed as we go to sleep at 9 p.m. every night. I make sure to say a prayer to God before I fall asleep.  “That’s our daily schedule on weekdays. On weekends, we like to wake up a little later than usual, give our bodies some much needed rest and also treat ourselves to some delicious vegan food and desserts at our favorite restaurants here.  Everything I do now is with more reverence and devotion for God   “We really believe in the importance of having a balanced and healthy lifestyle especially during these difficult times, so that we can be stronger not only physically but also mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.  “Although I had already started waking up at 4 a.m. since late last year as part of my personal practice, this time, I do it with more focus and intention.  “Everything I do now is with more reverence and devotion for God. This pandemic has definitely opened my eyes and heart to the importance of turning inward and connecting with myself on a soul level as this is what truly brings me closer to God.  “I fully understand that my spirit comes from Him and that none of this would be possible without Him, so I choose to live with love and devotion for our Creator.  “I pray more often and when I meditate and listen to my breath, I know that I am listening to Him as He is the One who makes me breathe.  “This is why my practice is so important to me because without it, I wouldn’t be able to fill my soul with nourishment and cultivate the vital energy that my physical body needs to be able to go about my daily life.  “I know that I won’t be able to perform my earthly duties without connecting to God first and foremost.   “It’s important to start your day with a prayer of gratitude as soon as you open your eyes. Thank God for waking you up to another beautiful day in this amazing world.  “Things may be overwhelming right now with so much going on in the world but just pray and trust that God will bring you through it all. Honor your emotions by really feeling what you’re feeling.  “Cry if you need to and release whatever emotions you’re experiencing so that they won’t get stuck lingering inside your body.  “Try your best to understand that you are only human and that whatever you’re feeling is just a part of your human experience.  “Connect with your heart and soul —that is the infinite part of you where God resides. You can do this. You can help yourself. You are a strong human being whose soul is made of pure love. You just have to believe in yourself. Just believe and be love.  We hope to inspire others to open their eyes, minds and hearts to the things that truly matter in life   “Daily yoga, meditation and prayer have helped me overcome challenges. Yoga asanas help strengthen my physical body and calm my nervous system. Meditation clears my mind of useless mental chatter which gives me space to come up with creative solutions for challenging situations. Prayer brings peace to my heart and soul as I trust the process knowing that God is in control.  “My morning yoga and meditation practice is a non-negotiable for me. I practice yoga asana at 5 a.m. for a good 45 minutes to an hour to prepare my physical body to be able to sit in meditation for at least an hour beginning at 6 a.m.  “It’s really something that I must do in order for me to tune in with myself, keep my emotions in check, catch my triggers, and just be a witness to my human experience.  “It helps me practice non-reactivity so that I can respond to situations more calmly instead of impulsively and emotionally like how I used to in the past. This sacred practice is what prepares me to face the day not only physically, but also mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.  “Practicing gentle yoga makes me feel so grounded and calm. Also, eating my favorite desserts like raw vegan donuts and cakes immediately makes me feel so giddy inside.  “Listening to some of my favorite music always raises my vibration. My current favorite album is ‘Chilombo’ by Jhene Aiko. I can listen to it all day!  “When I seem to be stuck in a rut, I have a clear and honest conversation with myself about what I need to do to dust myself off and just keep moving forward.  “No one else is going to motivate me or do any of this hard work for me —just me. So I just need to be real with myself about what I want to do and how I want to do it. It’s easier said than done but with consistent practice, it is possible.  “Rob and I recently launched our online yoga space called Mulat Manila wherein we give online yoga and meditation classes to those who would like to practice with us.  “We are currently holding donation-based classes wherein we ask the students to donate any amount to charity and send us proof of their donation through email so that we can give them the login details for the classes via Zoom.  “For our first week we partnered with Adopt A Family Bali which is a non-profit organization that raises funds for underprivileged Balinese families that were affected by Covid-19.  “Now, we’ve been holding classes for the benefit of Feed Philippines which is also a non-profit organization that raises funds to feed Filipino children in need during this pandemic.  “For beginner and regular yoga practitioners who want to experience our classes, we will also be offering yoga and meditation classes with drop-in and package rates soon.  “We will still include donation-based ones as we really want to use our social media channel to spread awareness and raise funds for those in need.  “Mulat means to open one’s eyes and awaken and this is what we hope to do with our fellow Filipinos through this project. We hope to inspire others to open their eyes, minds and hearts to the things that truly matter in life.” — Maxene Magalona-Mananquil as told to Carmencita S.

ASK A DERMA: How can I keep my skin looking youthful? (Part 2),https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/369359/ask-a-derma-how-can-i-keep-my-skin-looking-youthful-part-2/,"06:00 PM August 26, 2020","If you think about it, as we grow older, the skincare battle is about slowing down the clock. Our bodies change along with our skin’s properties. What we tend to lose is the skin’s ability to correct itself, bounce back fast from ideal conditions, and produce rapidly the substance it needs like collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. Our skin is also an indicator of our overall health. Dr. Gaile Robredo-Vitas says tells us, “Good and healthy skin can be described as one that is even-toned, smooth, with not-so-visible pores and without bumps, cracks or breaks in the skin. It can be pink but not red and is neither dry, flaky, nor oily and wrinkled. Healthy skin is a reflection of a healthy body.” In the first part, we talked about the skincare ingredients that will help you maintain that youthful skin. Here, we’re delving into your habits that go beyond your vanity set-up. #1 Have a good skincare routine that you are willing to follow consistently. #2 Eat a balanced diet and minimize consumption of refined sugars, trans fat, and processed food. Your body needs the right food to supply it with the nutrients it needs to function correctly. Without them, you become weak and more prone to diseases. #3 Get enough restful sleep. This is just as important as eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly. It is when we sleep that our body recovers. It is crucial for proper brain functioning and significantly affects cognition, concentration, and performance. #4 Exercise regularly. Being active and regularly moving benefits, you not only physically but also mentally. It is essential in the maintenance of strong bones and has been shown to improve your mood and well-being and reduce stress and anxiety. #5 Limit exposure to harmful elements. Avoid prolonged and extended exposure to UV radiation. Stop smoking. Both are detrimental to your skin and body as a whole. #1 Improper sunscreen use such as not applying the right amount, missing other body parts, not reapplying every two to three hours, and not using sunscreens on cloudy days. #2 Consuming too much sugar, processed food, alcohol, and caffeine. These cause inflammation accelerating the skin aging process. #3 Being stressed continuously. An increase in stress hormones that can, later on, cause hypertension, less efficient and slower metabolism, and contribute to skin aging. #4 Using items that dry the skin such as harsh soaps and cleansers or alcohol-based products. These strip your skin’s natural lipids that protect it from microbes and environmental toxins, making you more prone to irritation and infection. #5 Not taking care of your hair and nails as both also reflect our overall health.

ASK A DERMA: How can I keep my skin looking youthful? (Part 1),https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/367946/ask-a-derma-how-can-i-keep-my-skin-looking-youthful-part-1/,"08:24 PM August 25, 2020","This week’s Ask A Derma question may seem a bit broad. Unlike our previous features, we’re not just tackling one specific problem or ingredient. We dared ask a general question that summarizes all our skincare concerns. This is why we’re going to make this a two-part feature. In this first part, we asked Dr. Gaile Robredo-Vitas specifics when it comes to skincare products and how to make the most of what we have. Cleansers, toners, masks, serums, solutions, patches, lotions, and creams: It’s safe to say we’re drowning in skincare these days. We can also source them from different retailers and brands, each following a particular ethos. It’s confusing when the goal is pretty clear. No matter what skin type you have or how old you are, we’re seeking to achieve or preserve the glow that’s distinct from our younger years. At the very least, we’re celebrating aging through constantly adjusting our self-care routine to the changes of our bodies. How do we go about it strategically? Dr. Robredo-Vitas told us about her favorite skincare ingredients. In turn, we looked for some products that match her recommendation. Retinol (Vitamin A) is my go-to anti-aging ingredient. It reduces fine lines and wrinkles, improves pigmentation, reduces pores size, and makes our skin smoother and plumper. Retinol is keratolytic. It increases skin cell turnover by unclogging the pores and preventing the formation of blackheads or whiteheads and having breakouts. In addition to stimulating collagen production by activating specific receptors in our skin, retinol also prevents the production of collagenase, which is an enzyme that breaks down collagen in our skin. Retinol is also an antioxidant that protects our skin from the damage that environmental pollution and toxins we are exposed to daily. EDITOR’S PICK: Pixi Collagen & Retinol Serum. Available via Sephora.ph  Snail Secretion Filtrate or Snail Mucin is a mucus-like ingredient that is emitted by snails to protect themselves against bacteria, cuts, and UV rays. It contains a combination of potent ingredients like elastin, proteins, anti-microbials, copper peptides, hyaluronic acid, and glycolic acid. It’s known for being able to improve skin’s appearance overall. This one ingredient can do a lot for your skin, such as soothe redness, hydrate dry patches, reduce the appearance of signs of aging, brighten dark spots and other forms of hyperpigmentation, and protect your skin from free radicals. I like that this is also gentle enough to be used with other products with active ingredients because it complements them. EDITOR’S PICK: SNAILWHITE Whipp Soap Gold. Available via Watsons  Antioxidants, such as Vitamin C and E. I like to use them in combination. Vitamin C minimizes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and helps lighten pigmentation. Vitamin E acts as our first line of defense from free radicals and oxidative stress and helps protect our skin from environmental stressors such as UV radiation and pollution. The combined use of these two ingredients will give us healthy, younger-looking skin with a brighter and more even complexion. EDITOR’S PICK: Wild Ferns Lanolin Eye Crème with Collagen & Vitamin C & E. Available at Beauty Bar  Exfoliants, the Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) and Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs). We make new skin cells every 28 days, however as we get older, this ‘skin turnover’ slows down and becomes less efficient, resulting in dry, dull or lackluster skin, enlarged pores, and an uneven skin tone. Exfoliation aids in removing leftover dirt and debris not effectively by your cleansers and also removes dead skin cells to encourage the production of new ones and also allows for better penetration of the products you put on your skin. Both the AHAs and BHAs work by breaking the bonds that hold dead skin cells together on the surface, causing them to shed naturally revealing smoother skin. AHAs like your glycolic and lactic acids are water-soluble and work on the surface of the skin, while your BHA, your salicylic acid, is fat-soluble and goes deep inside the pore and helps to unclog it. EDITOR’S PICK: Murad AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser. Available at Rustan’s  Niacinamide or vitamin B3 is a water-soluble vitamin that works by restoring our skin’s protective barrier and repairing the damage caused by environmental stressors. Niacinamide also protects against moisture loss and dehydration. It works well with almost all ingredients and is well-tolerated by all skin types, even those with sensitive skin. When used consistently, it keeps your skin hydrated, improves uneven skin tone, and diminishes fine lines and wrinkles. EDITOR’S PICK: The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%. Available via BeautyMNL  It would be best if you used them regularly and consistently, applying the right amount at the right time, and using products that work synergistically together. You also should choose the type that works best with your skin and addresses your primary concerns.

"Declining COVID-19 deaths: We need vigilance, not fear",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/368963/declining-covid-19-deaths-we-need-vigilance-not-fear/,"02:43 PM August 20, 2020","The death rate, with some swings up and down, has been clearly declining. We have overreliance on inaccurate tests The high infection numbers reported by the Department of Health (DOH), while instructive, are misleading. It is resulting in all kinds of misplaced, repressive and destructive policies. Farr’s Law, a fundamental law in the science of epidemics, advises us that the real indicator to monitor is the death rate. The death rate of the Philippines, with some swings up and down, has been clearly declining for five months. It has moved from a peak of 8.57 percent on March 15, down to 1.65 percent on Aug. 15. (See graph, which is DOH data.) The death figures could actually be lower, since reporting of deaths from new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has not been accurate. Witness the current Philippine Health Insurance Corp. scandal where there have been financial incentives to report other deaths as COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, the Philippine Statistics Agency has just released the official death figures for 2019 and the first half of 2020. For the same period of January to June, there were more deaths in 2019 than in 2020. The same is true for the years 2017 and 2018. If we had a virulent epidemic, there would have been more deaths for the same period in 2020. But we have no “excess deaths.” The declining death rate and the absence of excess death tell us that the SARS-CoV-2 is not that deadly. A global study shows that COVID-19 is about as deadly as a strong common cold. The epidemic is stopping. Reason and vigilance, not panic, should now rule. More than 250,000 Filipinos get flu every year. Pneumonia kills 57,000 Filipinos yearly. But, in both cases, no one panics and shuts down the economy. The high infection numbers that are scaring a lot of people cannot be relied upon. The use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results in a lot of false positives. Dr. Kary Mullis, Nobel Prize laureate and inventor of the PCR, warned against using it as a diagnostic test. This is the reason why even the DOH has reported that 99 percent of the cases are either asymptomatic or mild, and that over two-thirds of the positive cases have recovered. Furthermore, the daily reports keep on adding up the numbers, instead of subtracting the recoveries and deaths or saying that most of the infections are mild. In addition, the new infections are mostly coming from younger people, who, if healthy, can easily overcome the disease. The infection numbers reported are numbers for those tested positive, mostly boosted by the increasing numbers of inaccurate tests. We may be having an epidemic of tests, not of the virus. Furthermore, test positives do not automatically mean real infections, unless verified by doctors. In turn, real infections do not mean a death sentence. Science points to the fact of “cross-immunity.” If we had encountered coronaviruses from the past, the immunity gained can be used to ward off COVID-19. A strong immune system can also resist the disease. Both kinds of immunity account for the declining death rates. There is also a scientific conundrum involved. There are no classic symptoms for COVID-19. Furthermore, scientists have not been able to isolate and purify the virus and establish this as the causative agent for COVID-19. The famous Koch’s Law has not been established for COVID-19. This immediately puts the RT-PCR tests in question. It is not clear what fragments of RNA identified in tests belong to SARS-CoV-2 or to other organisms that have an identical or similar RNA fragments. Overworked doctors, nurses and others are working under great pressure and stress. This is sad. But the low death rate of the virus itself is not the major cause, as seen above. Other factors are most likely involved. Overreliance on inaccurate tests is one of them. Lockdowns and vaccines are not necessary to solve the COVID-19 epidemic. Sweden and Iceland have shown this for the world. Our lockdowns should be lifted now and schools re-opened, as has been done in many other countries. Focus efforts on vulnerable segments of society, not on mandatory face shields and other restrictions on human rights. The existing number of hospital beds can handle the real serious cases. Then we will have a real normal and our society can heal again. —CONTRIBUTED  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
First major Mediterranean cruise liner sets sail since pandemic,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/368806/first-major-mediterranean-cruise-liner-sets-sail-since-pandemic/,"08:08 PM August 17, 2020","UPDATES WITH DEPARTURE by Francesco Gilioli with Alexandria Sage in Rome The first major cruise ship to resume tours of the Mediterranean since the coronavirus pandemic hit Europe set sail from the Italian city of Genoa on Sunday, as the industry tries to regain ground after a bruising hiatus. The departure of the MSC Grandiosa from the northwestern port city shortly after 17:30 GMT represents a high-stakes test for the global cruise sector. The crisis forced operators to ground their ships and also led to accusations that they botched the handling of the epidemic in its early stages. Cruise lines are hoping that tighter protocols will allow them to control the still-lingering threat of coronavirus aboard its ships while still offering travelers a cruise experience that does not disappoint. Earlier in the day, arriving passengers preparing to check in before taking a required coronavirus blood test inside the terminal told AFP they were not concerned about the virus. Some said they believed cruises were now safer than other vacation options. “I couldn’t miss the first cruise after COVID,” cruise blogger Rosalba Scarrone, 64, told AFP. “I’ve taken 87 cruises, can you imagine how much I’ve suffered not setting off from February until now?” The Grandiosa is part of the fleet of privately owned MSC Cruises, founded in Naples but now based in Geneva. The ship will travel to the ports of Civitavecchia near Rome, Naples, Palermo, and Valletta, Malta during the seven-day cruise. Competitor Costa Cruises, owned by Carnival, has opted to delay the restart of its Mediterranean tours until September, with departures from Trieste and Genoa for Italian-only clients to guarantee security. Much is riding on the decision to restart cruises. Italy represents the bulk of Europe’s cruise industry, reaping 14.5 billion euros of revenue per year ($17 billion) and supporting nearly 53,000 jobs, according to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). The group estimated a potential economic loss from suspended cruises throughout Europe could amount to about 25.5 billion euros. “The voyage … represents a tangible sign of comeback for one of the fundamental economic industries of our city,” said Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci. Over 2 million cruise passengers departed from the city last year. Last week, Italy’s government, which is striving to revive the country’s moribund economy after a more than two-month lockdown, gave cruise operators the green light to begin operating again as of August 15. MSC authorities said approximately 2,500 passengers were on board its debut cruise, limited to about 70 percent of normal capacity. All eyes in the industry will be on the Grandiosa after a smaller cruise operator, Norway’s Hurtigruten, was forced earlier this month to suspend its newly restarted service after dozens of passengers and crew tested positive for COVID-19. Global health authorities criticised the industry’s slow response to the spread of the virus at the onset of the crisis earlier this year before ships were grounded in March, from lax monitoring of crew, to continued operation of self-service buffets and gyms, to lack of personal protective equipment. As of June 11, 3,047 people were infected with coronavirus and 73 people died aboard 48 cruise ships affiliated with the trade group Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), according to Johns Hopkins University data provided by CLIA. Health authorities say close living and working spaces for the crew, along with partially enclosed environments, contributed to a greater risk of infection on cruises than other venues. MSC has suspended the rest of its Mediterranean cruises until October save for an August 29 cruise departing from the southern Italian port of Bari. The company said its new security protocol exceeds national and industry standards and includes daily temperatures taken and escorted trips in controlled groups for excursions. Food from the buffet, a highlight of the cruise experience, will be served at passengers’ tables.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020

According to Coleen, rest and research in all departments—physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual—are key in the last trimester of her pregnancy. “I’ve been pretty chill throughout this whole pregnancy, and I’ve really been loving and treasuring this time,” Coleen said. Coleen also shared how her fitness routine of walking and prenatal pilates have helped to prevent swelling and excessive aches and pains. Prenatal pilates is different from “regular” pilates. “There’s more of a focus on the transverse abdominis, which is that deep layer of muscles that ‘corset’ the waist,” according to PilatesAnytime.com, “The core connection becomes about building and reinforcing the support system, instead of increasing the strength of the abdominal contraction.” According to the pilates instruction site, “The deep breathing, as well as the mind-body connection, emphasized in Pilates sessions and classes helps to prepare mothers for labor and childbirth. These factors also help increase resolve, to better cope with the emotional ups and downs many women experience during pregnancy.” Coleen does every-other-day sessions with a BGC-based exercise studio. “I still feel very much like myself, but better, and I’m just soooooo excited for everything that comes after this!,” Coleen said, “I can’t believe how fast time is flying!” Celebrity couple Coleen Garcia and Billy Crawford announced the baby news in May.

Protein Power: The Plusses of Quality Pork,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/367320/protein-power-the-plusses-of-quality-pork/,"03:43 PM July 29, 2020","While growing up, a lot of us have been conditioned to associate baboy (pig) with a lot of negative things. Whether it’s in the television, in a household, or someplace else, we have heard some people use baboy as a derogatory term. In the Filipino context, it mostly meant poor health or poor hygiene. Even if the times are changing and despite more people learning what we now call a positive body image, the connotation around pork seems to be left behind.  But contrary to this common notion, pork is in fact a very healthy option depending on the quality and kind of cut you consume. Top quality pork can be obtained from livestock raised in a stress-free environment. Pilmico, the Aboitiz Group’s integrated food and agribusiness unit, utilizes updated technology that implements stringent biosecurity, sanitary measures, automated feed and temperature control, among others. These are complemented by on-site veterinarians who see to it that pigs’ proper growth is ensured. Pilmico is also a producer of high-quality animal feeds, which is also used in all its farms. Backed by experience and years of research to achieve the best formulation for pig nutrition, quality is ensured throughout all the phases of the pigs’ growth.  Pork often gets a bad rap, especially when it comes to eating healthy. But when raised following top quality standards, there could be more to it that your favorite “guilty” ulam. Here are five surprising health benefits of eating pork: 1. Improved Heart Health Compared to Other Meats Culinary tradition classifies pork as white meat, as it has a pale color both before and after cooking. A popular campaign launched in the late 1980s promoted pork as a lean meat alternative, and to this day, pork is still known as “the other white meat”. What’s more, studies have shown that there is no direct cause-and-effect link between eating pork and diseases like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, or death. As it is with everything, a moderated amount of high quality lean pork in your diet shouldn’t lead to health problems, versus other kinds of meat. 2. Better Workouts Working out is a necessary component of living healthy, as there are many benefits that come with living an active lifestyle. In order to reach optimum fitness levels however, your diet should be supplemented with healthy options to ensure ideal performance. Pork has plenty of nutrients such as taurine, beta-alanine, and creatine which improve mental focus, recovery, and muscle growth, respectively. Rather than getting them from supplements, a well-balanced diet that contains these nutrients is best. 3. High Quality Protein Pork is one of the best sources of high-quality protein, which is an essential nutrient for the human body. It helps us maintain healthier skin, nails, and hair, as well as build muscle. If you’re dieting or monitoring your weight, high-quality protein also helps in maintaining lean body mass. Pork also contains high concentrations of amino acids, which are the end-products of broken-down proteins. If you are looking to increase your muscle mass, you need to up your intake of protein, and pork is an ideal source. It can also accelerate recovery from injury or surgery. 4. Trimmable Fat Compared to other types of meat, pork fat is trimmable, which means you can help control the fat intake your body gets. Choose parts with minimal visible fat such as tenderloin, sirloin roast, and loin chops. The method of cooking can also help control fat, so stick to low-fat cooking methods like grilling and steaming. Choose thin or lean cuts of pork from a quality source. 5. Rich in Vitamins Pork is rich in essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins B6 and B12, and the mineral selenium. Vitamin B6 is crucial for your body to generate red blood cells, as well as in regulating the nervous system and maintaining ideal cognitive ability. It helps inhibit anxiety, according to various studies, as well as other brain dysfunctions. Vitamin B12 helps to improve brain function and blood formation, and is commonly found in animal products like pork. Selenium as well ensures that your thyroid glands function properly. All in all, pork is a fantastic choice when it comes to healthy eating. Its mild flavor as well as general ease of preparation solidifies its place as a staple of home cooking all over the world. It is versatile and can easily adapt to various cuisines, recipes, and textures depending on the cut you choose.

Each of us has a different approach on how to resolve and overcome these challenges,” she said. “Masakit po sa akin ang nangyari sa ABS-CBN dahil pangalawang tahanan ko na rin po ito na syang nagbigay sa akin ng mga opportunities to gradually reach my goals in life, na unti-unting nagpabago sa buhay ko at ng aking pamilya,” de Leon added. “And I will forever be thankful sa ABS-CBN and its Management.” (I was hurt by what happened to ABS-CBN because it was my second home and it gave me opportunities to gradually reach my goals in life, which slowly changed my life and that of my family.) She stated that while she sympathizes with fellow workers who lost jobs, she can express her support for the network even without attending noise barrages and rallies, owing to the imminent threat of COVID-19. “However, let us not forget that in the bigger picture, we are still at risk because we all have an invisible enemy to deal with. Our health and that of our loved ones are at stake. As the COVID infection rate in our country continues to rise, hospitals and facilities are nearing, if not reached, full capacity,” she explained. “Let’s not forget that our Frontliners continue to face life and death situation as they ore being challenged in saving more lives. Dadagdag pa ba tayo sa lumolobong bilang at patuloy [na] pagtaas ng COVID cases sa [ating bansa]?” (Will we have ourselves added in the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the country?) For the young actress, there is no substitute for being positive in the midst of the pandemic, as she asked, “Masama po bang maging positibo lang sa ating pananaw sa kabila ng kahirapan at paghihinagpis? (Is it bad to have a positive view in the midst of poverty and grief?) I don’t believe that it’s fair to stop doing things you ought to be doing everyday just because of the negative situations around us. Even if the world stops, we still have to keep moving forward.” “We can show our support in many ways. Let us not be judgmental and imposing on what others should do according to personal standards and beliefs. Wag po sanang mangibabaw ang galit sa ating puso, bagkus ay pairalin natin ang respeto sa isa’t-isa at umasang malalampasan din natin lahat ito,” she added. (Let us not allow anger to prevail in our hearts, let’s have respect for each other and wish that we will all surpass all of these.) In the end, de Leon stressed the power of prayers, asking everyone to “continue to do better to improve ourselves and continue helping those in need. Everyone is capable of this. Even a little goes a long way.” Meanwhile, her statement was met with mixed reactions from fans and followers, with some not overlooking the fact that the statement was issued after Angel Locsin’s call for her fellow Kapamilya stars to speak up for their home network and its workers. Some went so far as saying that one who plays Darna should be brave, and that de Leon should not criticize those who chose to go to the protests. Some of de Leon’s followers nonetheless applauded her for finally speaking up. Locsin, one of ABS-CBN’s biggest stars, also played Darna in a hugely successful TV series in GMA in 2005, before her transfer to ABS-CBN in 2007. Meanwhile, de Leon replaced another ABS-CBN star, Liza Soberano, in the role of Darna following Soberano’s withdrawal due to injuries.

La Scala plans 4 July concerts in post-lockdown reopening,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/365258/la-scala-plans-4-july-concerts-in-post-lockdown-reopening/,"08:36 PM June 29, 2020","ROME (AP) — Italy’s La Scala theater is reopening next week after a four-month coronavirus shutdown with a series of four concerts before a reduced audience of 600, a third of its normal capacity. General manager Dominique Meyer said La Scala was reopening one step at a time as the theater, located in the capital of virus-struck Lombardy, seeks to adhere to Italy’s strict hygiene and social distancing measures for artists and audience alike. “I think for many music lovers, the time has come to return to hearing live music, even if the means are reduced,” Meyer told reporters. The concerts on July 6, 8, 13, and 15 will feature small numbers of artists on stage performing arias, instrumental selections, and other pieces. The July 13 concert features recent graduates of La Scala’s academy to highlight the future of opera, while the final event brings members of the La Scala Philharmonic back home after performing a series of free concerts in Milan courtyards in June. Meyer told reporters Monday he was pleasantly surprised that, even with social distancing in place, the theater was able to accommodate up to 600 spectators out of its capacity of more than 2,000. He said La Scala worked with experts from Milan’s Sacco infectious disease hospital to make sure all necessary health measures were adopted. “We are specialists in spectacle, but not in health,” he explained. Concert-goers will be required to wear protective masks entering and exiting the theater, though they can take them off once seated. La Scala assumes most tickets will be sold in pairs, so the floor plan has been arranged to have pairs of seats occupied, with spacing between them. No intermission is planned and the snack bar will remain closed to prevent lines from forming. Ticket prices range from 24-48 euros ($27-$53). Plans are in place for streaming the concerts and future performances, although the details haven’t been worked out. After the August break, La Scala returns in September with a performance of Verdi’s Requiem in Milan’s Duomo cathedral to remember Italy’s virus dead, followed by Beethoven’s 9th in the theater on Sept. 5. Plans for full-scale operas to resume are on hold since Italy’s current virus-containment measures would preclude so many artists being on stage at once, Meyer said. The Lombardy region around Milan was the ground zero of Europe’s COVID-19 outbreak and still is registering double and triple-digit infections every day. But health care officials say the situation is under control. Italy has seen over 240,000 confirmed coronavirus infections and over 34,700 dead, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the true toll of the pandemic is higher due to limited testing and missed mild cases.  Photo courtesy of Teatro alla Scala/Brescia-Amisano  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Poll: Americans are the unhappiest they’ve been in 50 years,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/364453/poll-americans-are-the-unhappiest-theyve-been-in-50-years/,"10:57 PM June 16, 2020","By TAMARA LUSH ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Spoiler alert: 2020 has been rough on the American psyche. Folks in the U.S. are more unhappy today than they’ve been in nearly 50 years. This bold — yet unsurprising — conclusion comes from the COVID Response Tracking Study, conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. It finds that just 14% of American adults say they’re very happy, down from 31% who said the same in 2018. That year, 23% said they’d often or sometimes felt isolated in recent weeks. Now, 50% say that. The survey, conducted in late May, draws on nearly a half-century of research from the General Social Survey, which has collected data on American attitudes and behaviors at least every other year since 1972. No less than 29% of Americans have ever called themselves very happy in that survey. Most of the new survey’s interviews were completed before the death of George Floyd touched off nationwide protests and a global conversation about race and police brutality, adding to the feelings of stress and loneliness Americans were already facing from the coronavirus outbreak — especially for black Americans. Lexi Walker, a 47-year-old professional fiduciary who lives near Greenville, South Carolina, has felt anxious and depressed for long stretches of this year. She moved back to South Carolina late in 2019, then her cat died. Her father passed away in February. Just when she thought she’d get out and socialize in an attempt to heal from her grief, the pandemic hit. “It’s been one thing after another,” Walker said. “This is very hard. The worst thing about this for me, after so much, I don’t know what’s going to happen.” Among other finding from the new poll about life in the pandemic: — The public is less optimistic today about the standard of living improving for the next generation than it has been in the past 25 years. Only 42% of Americans believe that when their children reach their age, their standard of living will be better. A solid 57% said that in 2018. Since the question was asked in 1994, the previous low was 45% in 1994. — Compared with surveys conducted after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 and after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Americans are less likely to report some types of emotional and psychological stress reactions following the COVID-19 outbreak. Fewer report smoking more than usual, crying or feeling dazed now than after those two previous tragedies, though more report having lost their temper or wanting to get drunk. — About twice as many Americans report being lonely today as in 2018, and not surprisingly given the lockdowns that tried to contain the spread of the coronavirus, there’s also been a drop in satisfaction with social activities and relationships. Compared with 2018, Americans also are about twice as likely to say they sometimes or often have felt a lack of companionship (45% vs. 27%) and felt left out (37% vs. 18%) in the past four weeks. What is surprising, said Louise Hawkley, a senior research scientist with NORC at the University of Chicago, was that loneliness was not even more prevalent. “It isn’t as high as it could be,” she said. “People have figured out a way to connect with others. It’s not satisfactory, but people are managing to some extent.” The new poll found that there haven’t been significant changes in Americans’ assessment of their families’ finances since 2018 and that Americans’ satisfaction with their families’ ability to get along financially was as high as it’s been over nearly five decades. Jonathan Berney, of Austin, Texas, said that the pandemic — and his resulting layoff as a digital marketing manager for a law firm — caused him to reevaluate everything in his life. While he admits that he’s not exactly happy now, that’s led to another uncomfortable question: Was he truly happy before the pandemic? “2020 just fast forwarded a spiritual decay. When things are good, you don’t tend to look inwards,” he said, adding that he was living and working in the Miami area before the pandemic hit. As Florida dealt with the virus, his girlfriend left him and he decided to leave for Austin. “I probably just wasn’t a nice guy to be around from all the stress and anxiety. But this forced an existential crisis.” Berney, who is looking for work, said things have improved from those early, dark days of the pandemic. He’s still job hunting but has a little savings to live on. He said he’s trying to kayak more and center himself so he’s better prepared to deal with any future downturn in events. Reimagining happiness is almost hard-wired into Americans’ DNA, said Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside. “Human beings are remarkably resilient. There’s lots and lots of evidence that we adapt to everything. We move forward,” she said, adding that she’s done happiness studies since the pandemic started and found that some people are slightly happier than last year. Melinda Hartline, of Tampa, who was laid off from her job in public relations in March, said she was in a depressed daze those first few weeks of unemployment. Then she started to bike and play tennis and enrolled in a college course on post-crisis leadership. Today, she’s worried about the state of the world and the economy, and she wonders when she can see her kids and grandkids who live on the West Coast — but she also realizes that things could be a lot worse. “Anything can happen. And you have to be prepared,” she said. “Whether it’s your health, your finances, whether it’s the world. You have to be prepared. And always maintain that positive mental attitude. It’s going to get you through it.” ___ The survey of 2,279 adults was conducted May 21-29 with funding from the National Science Foundation. It uses a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.    CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Creative Diaries: A quarantine diary by celebrity stylist and entrepreneur Pam Quiñones,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/363642/creativity-in-lockdown-a-quarantine-diary-by-celebrity-stylist-and-entrepreneur-pam-quinones/,"03:24 PM June 03, 2020"," In this series we asked artists, photographers, fashion stylists, makeup artists, and other creatives to share photo diaries of life in quarantine. This conversation has been edited for clarity.   “I miss having small gatherings with friends and family over a meal with endless stories. It’s something so common pre-quarantine, but now that such a get-together is so elusive, I am longing for it each day.  “I also miss traveling and learning about new cultures. Every day for weeks now, I take a mental and aural vacation to Latin America or any beach for that matter. I manifest this by playing Latin jazz funk on replay while I dress in tropical outfits, while my husband works with his desktop playing a video of a beach somewhere in the Pacific.   “Although, this experience has also allowed me to discover that I’m actually loving working from home, and that I can be more productive with my time because I don’t need to sit in traffic for hours. Because my overall mood is generally better, I have a clearer head to start my day.  I’m a work in progress, but I’m striving to be more sustainable in other parts of my life outside fashion  “I’ve also become more mindful about every small decision I make daily such as buying food that doesn’t come in disposable containers, procuring fresh and natural foods over fast food, and so many other little things that Im grateful for. I’m a work in progress, but I’m striving to be more sustainable in other parts of my life outside fashion. Who would’ve thought that all we needed was time to be more conscious about everything we do?    “I now know my way around the kitchen, which was definitely not the case pre-quarantine. Because my husband Chris prefers wholesome ingredients, we became more particular with what we buy. I started baking rye rustic bread and after the third try, I can say that I’m really happy about it. I’ve made pizzas and tacos using healthier alternatives. Ive also started baking wholesome cakes and cookies with rye flour and coconut sugar or muscovado. But I think I’m most proud about my roast chicken, which came out really great on the first try.   “At Vestido, a fashion rental space I co-founded last year, while our rental operations are suspended, we decided to launch an initiative called Fashion For Others. Fashion For Others is a benefit sale launched by Vestido with the help of Steph Kienle Gonzalez. It was inspired by Courage Cebu, a fundraising platform that sells art, furniture, and fashion for the benefit of the frontliners in the Visayas. I donated pieces from my wardrobe and they almost got sold out. This was also my first time to organize a fundraiser. It occupies a big part of my day, but it’s been really fulfilling.  “My partner at Vestido, Cindy Go Bayot, Steph and I talked about which communities are heavily affected by the crisis and need aid the most. This is how we chose our beneficiary partners: PAGASA, which focuses on providing survival packs for families who have lost their means of livelihood during the crisis; House of Laurel, which currently manufactures and distributes PPEs to hospitals; and The Moment Group, which provides meals for frontliners.  “We reached out to friends with great style and fashion designers with good hearts to open up their closets for Fashion For Others. With some designers who donated, Fashion For Others also became a way for them to raise funds for their staff, where 50% of profits go to the designer, and the other half to our partner beneficiaries. We have strictly indicated in our guidelines that delivery of pieces from our donors to buyers will take place after the lockdown to ensure that we are not putting unnecessary risk to couriers.     “With Qurator, while I assume the role of a decision maker, I’m lucky to have a core group which consists of senior stylists Maita Baello and Melville Sy, who have helped me ensure that everyone in the team is safe and taken care of. Our priority is to make sure that we attend to the team and their needs. Our regular employees continue to receive their salaries while the rest are given access to a crisis fund.   There will be a tapering of  systems for the better   “Because 100% of our work is put on hold, the next step was self-improvement through an internal weekly styling masterclass I started with the team two weeks into the lockdown. We’ve done eight weeks of coursework and it’s been really great. It became a way for us to continue our fashion dialogue and learn new topics, which I must admit, we’ve tried multiple times to schedule before the quarantine, but never really had the time to do as it was very rare for us to have a common schedule, let alone have everyone in the same place at the same time. I realized that it also became a way for us to connect and check up on each other.  “While we’re hopeful that everything picks up from where we’ve left off, I know our work and the whole industry will never be the same. I’m foreseeing a shift in how we do business, with new safety protocols in place and decision makers identifying which steps and structures  are absolutely essential.  There will be a tapering of  systems for the better. We’ve already started doing this at Qurator where we’re evaluating our current structure and building new methods to ensure a smooth post-lockdown transition. We are prioritizing our team members by laying out better health and financial packages for them. We’re also looking at our craft in-depth and finding ways on how to add more value and become more sustainable in our practice.  “Once the quarantine ends, the first order of business for me is to see our team at Qurator and give them a big hug, and start implementing all the planning we’ve done during the quarantine. I’d like to go to the salon too, where I will spend hours having my nails and hair done as they really need some TLC,  followed by a 2-hour long massage, for sure!  “Subsequently, we’ll open our Vestido showroom immediately so we can begin the process of delivering pieces to buyers who purchased during our benefit sale. We’re excited for the shoppers to finally get their pieces.      “I would say, the bright side of the quarantine is that we’re given the time to rethink and refocus our priorities; to think of ways to do things differently in a way that adds value to our lives, to those around us, and our environment.  “I can only speak for myself and the people I have spoken to during the quarantine, but I think the ‘new normal’ or ‘next normal’ enables us to become more mindful of every decision we make, big or small, which in effect, will add value to others; consume more quality than quantity and support and appreciate products and services closer to home, and value gatherings like never before, where we get to hug and kiss people on the cheek, among others.  “I listened to a podcast by trendforecaster Li Edelkoort who said, ‘…the virus can be seen as a representation of our conscience… It brings to light what is terribly wrong with society and every day that becomes more clear. It teaches us to slowdown and to change our ways.’  That couldn’t be more true.” — Pam Quiñones as told to Carmencita S. Sioson   Cover image: Pam’s work desk.

Creativity in Lockdown: A quarantine diary by photographer Paolo Crodua,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/362376/creativity-in-lockdown-a-quarantine-diary-by-photographer-paolo-crodua/,"04:00 PM May 13, 2020","In this series we asked artists and photographers to share photo diaries of life in quarantine. This conversation has been edited for clarity. “A regular day for me would be looking for ways to be awake while the sun’s out. I’m always woken up by two pit bulls, with a whimper or a bark. I play with them for a few minutes and tell them how good they are. (This photo series is of them, Lulu and Iggy. Pit bulls are very elegant creatures.) After that I have coffee, then I’m mostly glued to my phone, watching something or talking to friends. Everything else would then be white noise, except for the two doggos who are in constant need of attention. At times I get a jolt of ideas for personal projects, most of which I don’t really do anything about. I don’t really follow the news faithfully, but I’m always updated somehow. There’s no escaping it. “The most recent film I saw and enjoyed was Les Choristes. I binged three seasons of Elite and four seasons of Money Heist—definitely made me want to speak Spanish. I’m currently watching Into the Night on Netflix. “I haven’t been able to produce shoots or creative work so far, it has been almost two months now. It was easy for me to be comfortable with not being productive for the first month, but I soon got in touch with reality and have been thinking of ways to go about what I do, since I’m most likely not going out anytime soon. The most difficult thing I’ve had to put up with so far is feeling like shit, which I’m still thankful for, in the grander scale of things. If we get out of this alive, I hope we never forget what life is like right now and have motivation that lasts a lifetime. “My thoughts about life and its relationship with art constantly change, more so this time. If there’s anything positive this situation has brought me, it’s being able to thoroughly think of ways to approach what I do and its bigger purpose. Are online shoots something I want to do? Should I focus on doing projects that I can do alone? Is this the right time for me to be more experimental? Should I just wait for things to go back to the way they were? How long will that take? I’m not really sure. I hope I can still afford to do what I do. “After the lockdown, a cup of coffee al fresco on a sunny day would be nice. I know a number of art exhibits happening, let’s hope they push through, and perhaps my rescheduled shoots as well. If we get out of this alive, I hope we never forget what life is like right now and have motivation that lasts a lifetime. I hope we’ll all be able to quickly adapt to this ‘new normal’ and stay healthy. My biggest hope really is for a better political climate, but that may be reaching for the stars.” —Paolo Crodua as told to Jed Gregorio Paolo Crodua is a Filipino photographer who works between Manila and Cebu, Philippines, and Taiwan.

6 Local Brands for our Lockdown Workout Outfits,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/361898/6-local-brands-for-our-lockdown-workout-outfits/,"05:43 PM May 11, 2020","Exercise is often cited as a healthy way to cope with stress. It’s scientifically-proven! It’s why these days, some turned up their fitness routine. Others who rarely go to the gym pre-lockdown are turning to at-home fitness apps and online programs to get those endorphins. Not so scientifically-proven is how a good outfit can motivate you to be consistent with your exercise schedule. It’s effective with me, along with the almost-mandatory workout selfie. As we spend our days on lockdown, online proof that we’re doing those reverse crunches builds that sense of community. We cheer each other on! So go on and help out the homegrown fitness brands that are helping us stay fit during the lockdown. Here are a few I’ve stalked via Instagram. This brand is all about sustainability and ethical practices, so the quality of each piece isn’t just in its materials. I tried Jen Top, which gives extra support for your breasts.

This line is made for the fitness freak who loves trying out new workouts regularly. My pick is the Freedom Contour Set. The leggings feature a tummy control band while the top is a comfortable fit, the straps of which don’t dig into my shoulders. I notice how this brand is an Instagram favorite with eye-catching sets. But the designs are not without purpose. You can use their pieces for different indoor activities. When times get better, you’ll still get to use them as they can transition for surfing and other outdoor sports. If you need colorful gym gear, this is the spot!

Charma features dynamic designs and unique fabrics that adapt to your movement and body. They use sweat-wicking microfiber, breathable lycra, compression, and power mesh to help you do whatever you like from “slow-yet-strengthening yoga, movement-based dance, cardio-centric indoor cycling, high-intensity circuit training, or anything else in between.”  Photo courtesy of The Shape Shop Active on Instagram  Bed sheet workouts and abs in two weeks: Get moving while at home   Audrey Hepburn meets Godard in this movie list curated by Hedi Slimane   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Iron for Immunity: How food rich in iron can help you combat diseases,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/361760/iron-for-immunity-how-food-rich-in-iron-can-help-you-combat-diseases/,"05:35 PM April 30, 2020"," In this time and age, taking care of our health is one of our greatest responsibilities as we face a life-threatening battle with COVID-19. Now, more than ever, is the time for us to invest in our health and ensure that our body is getting all the essential nutrients it needs to protect ourselves from diseases. One way to do it is to change the way we eat and start consuming healthier food that nourish the body, such as those rich in iron which can help boost immunity.  Iron is necessary for immunity Iron is a fundamental element that the body needs for normal development of the immune system. It helps in the production of lymphocytes or white blood cells that act as the frontliners of the immune system—fighting diseases and infections by protecting the body from harmful invaders such as viruses and bacteria. A deficiency in iron affects the body’s capacity to have an adequate immune response, making us more prone to diseases. Iron deficiency can also cause anemia and the sub-optimal production of red blood cells. In the Philippines, studies show that a large percentage of the population, especially among children, suffer from malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies—particularly Iron Deficiency anemia. Inadequate intake of key nutrients like iron could lead to adverse effects on our health which is why it’s important to consume foods that provide the daily recommended dietary amount of iron. The good news is that there are a lot of common foods out there that are not just rich in iron and packed with nutrients, but are also delicious and easy to prepare at home! Start your day right Breakfast is the first and most important meal of the day as you gear up for everything else that comes your way. Getting a hearty breakfast meal that not only fills up your tummy but also gives your body the energy and sustenance it needs is one of the best ways to start the day. Adding whole-grain food like Quaker Oats to your daily breakfast meal can help you get various nutrients that your body needs without consuming any other supplements or enhancements. Known as supergrain because of its many benefits, oats are a natural source of many vitamins and minerals that your body needs to help maintain good health, including iron. Oats are also a natural source of zinc, protein, fiber, selenium, thiamin (Vitamin B1) and folate which has various functions in the body––this includes maintaining a good immune system and better blood flow, ensuring good bowel movements and keeping a well-balanced diet that could reduce heart health risks. With a bowl of Quaker Oats for breakfast, you can be sure to start your day with iron. And even on a hectic schedule, this easy-to-prepare breakfast staple ensures that you’re getting the proper amount of vitamins and minerals to start your day right. While staying at home, there are many ways you can elevate a Quaker Oats meal for the family to enjoy. There’s the classic “just-add-milk” approach that can go with almost everything else. You can try adding fruits and nuts or bake it into treats. There are also lots of lip-smacking savory recipes you can try like Oats with Sardines, Oats Chow Fan and more.

‘Porn doesn’t even spark joy anymore’: Alone and sexually frustrated amid COVID-19 pandemic,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/361745/porn-doesnt-even-spark-joy-anymore-alone-and-sexually-frustrated-amid-covid-19-pandemic/,"01:49 PM April 30, 2020","JAKARTA — Like many others who are required to shelter in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, Fachri – not his real name – has been busy filling his spare time with an assortment of activities, from polishing his writing skills to playing video games, on top of doing the day-to-day work-related stuff. But as the situation in Indonesia shows little progress in recovering, with more than 9,500 people officially infected by the disease as of Tuesday afternoon, the 28-year-old researcher felt a sense of frustration set in, as he found out that trying out new things could not always replace his pre-quarantine routines. This frustration is further offset by the fact that Fachri lives alone in a kos-kosan (rooming house) in Jakarta. The endless stream of information on COVID-19 that populates his news and social media feed and dominates discussions in his work and friendship circles has him feeling more mentally drained and lonelier as time passes. To nip those feelings categorically in the bud, Fachri would usually resort to the cheap and instant gratification that comes from sexual self-stimulation. “One of the things I like to do is masturbate or watch porn, which are not new things for me. In this kind of situation, I feel like those two are the easiest ways to cast away my frustrations,” he told The Jakarta Post recently. But sometimes not even self-pleasure may be enough to weather the large-scale social restrictions currently in place. The unforeseen impact that the COVID-19 outbreak has had on his mental condition, Fachri believes, has affected so much of his sex life that getting pleasure out of sexual activities is no longer as fulfilling as it used to be. “Although I feel like the intensity of my masturbating has increased markedly from [pre-pandemic] times, I am slowly getting bored from doing it all the time,” he said. “The sensation is lost on me.” Sex, as much as Indonesia’s largely conservative society tries to disregard, has offered solace for many people during this time of restricted physical and social interactions. As such, the shelter-in-place orders set up as a form of physical distancing have unwittingly affected the sex lives of many people as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on. AFP reported earlier this month that contraception giant Karex from neighboring Malaysia had witnessed an increase in demand for its condoms “as people worldwide are confined to their homes”, despite a gloomy forecast that sees fewer condoms produced due to massive restrictions implemented across the country. Meanwhile in India, the same report notes that sales of contraceptives rose between 25 to 35 percent in the week after the country announced its nationwide lockdown last month. Adult entertainment sites such as Pornhub have even offered 30 days of free “premium” access to its large library of videos, becoming a spoil for many people and an extra incentive to stay at home during quarantine season. While couples can still fulfill their needs while sheltering in place, sexually active lone wolves like Fachri often have to settle for themselves, as finding a hookup or meeting noncohabitant partners still bears the risk of contracting the coronavirus. “In the past five weeks, there was one instance when I felt really [sexually frustrated] and I ended up breaking my own rule of not hooking up with one of my friends. I realized that I took a really big risk by doing that,” Fachri said. “And surprisingly, instead of getting pleasure out of it, I didn’t enjoy it at all,” he added. The experience has him considering sex toys and exploring genres of pornography that he never thought to try. Nadya and Wahyu – also not their real names – suffer from a condition similar to Fachri’s. Wahyu, 25, a photographer living in Bandung, West Java, admitted that the quarantine policy had left him emotionally weary and sexually frustrated, to a point where he felt he could not handle it anymore. “A week ago, I decided to give dating apps a go as I was quite fed up with masturbation and porn. I needed a real person [to be with]. But after the hookup, it felt like this wasn’t what I was looking for,” he said. “I am utterly confused because I can’t figure out the answer [to my frustration].” An Indonesian based in Malaysia, Nadya said she could not even resist the urge to meet with her friends-with-benefits a few days after the country announced its movement control order (MCO) last month, in which residents are only allowed to go out of their homes to buy food, groceries and medicine. Malaysia imposed the MCO on March 14 for an initial two-week period but as of April 23, authorities extended the policy until May 12. Going that long without sex was simply out of the question for the 25-year-old woman. “Porn doesn’t even spark joy anymore; there’s no communication or touching that arouses me. So I’ve been meeting him twice a week since the MCO came into effect,” Nadya said. “We have talked about the risks of meeting one another during this situation, but we trust each other. We take care of our own hygiene and health,” she added. Sex psychologist Baby Jim Aditya said that experiencing social frustrations during the pandemic was a probable occurrence, as the uncertainty that arises from the current situation would be felt in every facet of people’s lives, whether economic, psychological, social or sexual. But the probability of sexual frustration is even greater among those who live on their own. “The inability to meet directly or have physical contact with other people already creates frustration. There is also the possibility that people who are sexual frustrated are also the ones who had lost their jobs [as a result of the outbreak],” she told the Post last week. Baby likens substituting sexual intercourse with masturbation or porn to reading the wrong indicator when driving a vehicle. “When our vehicle runs out of fuel but we fail to read the right indicator, we may think that it is only lacking water. So when we fill it up with water and it doesn’t work at all, the craving for [the other] still remains,” she said. For another renowned sex psychologist, Zoya Amirin, the COVID-19 pandemic should be seen as an opportunity for those who are single and sexually active to explore their sexuality, by properly learning to satisfy themselves without porn. “Masturbation is our safest sexual expression, but we also need to do it in a healthy way. We need to masturbate to explore our own bodies – we aren’t supposed to be encouraged by desperation,” Zoya said recently. She said that people should stop comparing their current sex lives with the normalcy they felt before the COVID-19 pandemic. “If we keep saying things like, ‘I am so desperate’, ‘I don’t have anyone’ or ‘I feel lonely during this pandemic’, this will only lead to more [frustration] when we masturbate. “We also have to think of it as the new normal in terms of sexuality. The challenge for those single and sexually active now is how to spoil themselves,” Zoya told the Post. “If we can empower ourselves through sexual fantasy, it will help us manage our sex lives without judgment. It will lead to a better, healthier sex life.”  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Fitness Apps To Help You Work Out Better From Home ,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/361122/fitness-apps-to-help-you-work-out-better-from-home/,"02:38 PM April 16, 2020","The fitness industry has completely changed. With gyms chains temporarily closing their doors throughout the world as we all try to practice social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic, the concept of staying active has been redefined as we know it. First, we all have to find a way to get our exercise while staying within the safety of our home. And second, most of us have to do that with very little space and with little to no traditional fitness equipment. In short, we all could use a little help. That’s where technology comes in. Fitness apps offer workout programs featuring everything from your basic yoga flow to intense HIIT—all formulated by the pros. Whether you have ten minutes or two hours, there’s something for everyone. Here are three of my favorites you can sweat with. If you’re just at the start of your fitness journey and not quite sure what to do, Sworkit is a good option. Sworkit has a free version and a 30-day trial for the premium version. The free version has a number of well-thought-out routines—from strength, cardio and flexibility—and, they start from the fundamental basics. You can go through the library of movements and there is a very clear demo of each one, in addition to a feature that builds you a program based on difficulty and your goals. In 2015, a group of sports professionals analyzed 30 popular free fitness apps and found that Sworkit was the most aligned with the American College of Sports Medicine’s training guidelines. That means that safety and functionality come first with this app. Also, I really like how they have a section solely focused on home workouts. For the best-preset routines, Nike Training Club (NTC), is the way to go. Like Sworkit, you can build a program based on your goals, but the routines are categorized not only by the type of training, muscle group, and difficulty level, but also on how much equipment is needed intensity, and duration. For example, if I have no equipment and only have 20 minutes to work out, there are a variety of workout routines already programmed for you to choose from. That is why this app has always been my go-to, especially when I travel because I don’t know how my schedule will be and if I will have access to a gym or not. On top of that, I really like how they go about the routine—the demo of the moves is very understandable, and the instruction is clear and encouraging. This app provides what to do, and you literally have to “just do it.” Lastly, they’re allowing everyone to have access to the premium version for free till further notice due to the pandemic. If you’re a veteran gym goer, know all about split training (fancy term for working out specific muscle groups on different days), and know exactly what muscle group you’d like to exercise, then you should check out Fitbod. This is an incredible app and a bodybuilder’s dream. Fitbod provides a specific workout based on available equipment, cardio or strength preference, muscle group recovery, workout duration, and recent routines. Yes, that’s right. It looks at the workouts you’ve completed and will adjust your succeeding workouts according to your progress. Now that’s pretty cool. That also means that this app helps you track every exercise and your overall progress. My favorite feature has to be the reporting—there’s a weekly report that is emailed to you that shares how much weight you lifted and how much time you worked out. I find that greatly motivating! The main reason why I am recommending fitness apps to complement your home workout efforts is because even though it makes me so happy that more and more people are finding ways to be active at home, I want to encourage everyone to get the proper guidance. With any physical activity, there is a risk of injury and your health is the utmost priority, especially now. In case you don’t have a trainer to check in with, or a Zoom fitness class to join, these apps will make sure you have the proper form and can help you strategically come up with a routine that is healthy and sustainable for you. Have a good sweat session!

Now Might Be A Good Time To Try It  How to Make the Most of Your Home Workouts   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
Curious About Intermittent Fasting? Now Might Be A Good Time To Try It,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/360831/curious-about-intermittent-fasting-now-might-be-a-good-time-to-try-it/,"09:01 PM April 09, 2020","I had been wanting to try intermittent fasting for years now, but it was always an immediate no for me. I didn’t want to go through the adjustment period of feeling weak and hungry while I had to deal with high-pressure work situations. Since I started staying at home due to this coronavirus pandemic, I had no excuse to not try it, and I’m so glad I did. I started practicing intermittent fasting or IF, with the guidance of my coach, Gib Osbert Ang (@ozcustomizedtraining). A few weeks into this, not only am I experiencing all the benefits I’m about to mention below, but it is also helping me stay disciplined—maintaining a routine and keeping me from constantly snacking. With this lockdown, we all know how easy it is to fall into that when you are at home watching your favorite Netflix show or just plain bored. If you’ve been curious about giving IF a try as well, this might be the best time to do so, and here’s why: Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating, and there are various ways to do IF. The most popular one is the 16/8 method wherein you fast for 16 hours, then you eat within a window of 8 hours. Coach had me work my way up to 20 hours fasting and 4 hours of eating. With a smaller eating window, logic would suggest that you would consume fewer calories than you typically would. Granted, you don’t binge and still eat fairly healthy within the eating window. IF also increases the release of fat-burning hormones. Because of this, fasting can increase your metabolic rate by 3.6–14%, ultimately lowering fat mass. By helping you eat fewer calories and burn more of it IF causes weight loss by changing both sides of the calorie equation. When I started IF mid-March, my weight was around 117 pounds. I now weigh about 112 and I’ve been staying there for the past week. This weight loss is huge for me because that’s a considerable amount of weight for my petite frame and I still am maintaining my muscle tone despite losing the pounds. And, I am able to miraculously do this even while being cooped up at home being only a few steps away from a fully-stocked kitchen, and having no access to a gym. When you’re constantly eating throughout the day, a lot of your body’s energy is dedicated to digesting the food you’re eating. When you’re fasting for extended periods of time, your body has the opportunity to focus on healing itself and reducing any inflammation, rather than digestion. Intermittent fasting can exponentially reduce oxidative damage in the body, fighting against aging and the development of numerous diseases. Initially, you may feel a little weak and maybe even experience headaches as you adjust to IF. That was the case for me. However, once you get used to it, people have experienced a clear, more-focused mind, better bowel movements and gut function, and faster healing of wounds or scars. I certainly feel sharper while I’m fasting, and I’m also quite surprised that I don’t feel the need to drink as much coffee as I used to. I also noticed that I have some scars that have lightened. That could be unrelated, but I think it definitely is! We talked about how when you’re fasting for long periods of time, your cells are given the chance to heal. The same goes with the regeneration of immunity cells. In 2014, a study from the University of California found that fasting lowered white blood cell counts, which in turn, triggered the immune system to start producing new ones. White blood cells are a key component of your body’s immune system. This ultimately means that IF can boost your immunity. Unlike the previous benefits, this is not as clear cut though. Fasting itself can be slightly detrimental to one’s immunity, because of the deprivation of nutrients. It is actually the process of refeeding within the eating window that triggers the regeneration of the white blood cells. What does this mean? It’s important to be careful while you’re fasting and to not be exposed to anything that would get you sick, and also make sure to eat well when you do refeed. If you are a frontliner or find yourself being exposed to illness or COVID-19, it would be best to not try IF at this time. But, if you are currently healthy and staying within the safety of your home during this pandemic, perhaps it’s a good time to give it a whirl. This has been my initial experience with intermittent fasting so far, and I plan to continue this as long as this lockdown lasts. If you’ve been playing around with the idea of IF and circumstances allow you to give it a try, this might be the best time to do so. The following are some additional information to take in consideration when doing IF. Also, like any change to your health routine, please make sure your doctor signs off on it, and that you do it under the guidance of a pro.

Quick chat with Lovi Poe: ‘Getting up every morning and being optimistic makes a huge difference’,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/360818/quick-chat-with-lovi-poe-getting-up-every-morning-and-being-optimistic-makes-a-huge-difference/,"03:51 PM April 09, 2020"," Once in a while, you need to take a break from the current news cycle and read up on stories of how others are championing self-care and uplifting each other, which are especially helpful in times of considerable stress and anxiety.  As we continue to give you a glimpse of what your favorite personalities have been up to during self-isolation and share their small wins and recent self-discoveries, we hope these Q&As, albeit brief, will encourage you to make the most of this challenging experience.  During our quick chat with actress (and our perennial fitspiration) Lovi Poe, she quipped, “Getting up every morning morning and being optimistic makes a huge difference.” It’s a simple statement that can change how you spend your days. In a time that makes it easy for us to get sucked into negative dialogues and to fill our minds with unnecessary thoughts, it’s good to be reminded of “how powerful our minds can be.” Keep reading for more of Lovi’s latest musings.  What I miss most are….the things that we do so casually, which are suddenly not to be taken for granted.  As soon as the quarantine ends, I’ll be…giving my family and friends a big hug. Grabbing a few drinks or a cup of coffee to catch up with some friends. And probably head to the beach or just go to a beautiful place just to take in the beauty of life and appreciate what’s given to us.   The five things I realized about myself are…I’ve gotten so used to having a busy schedule that I have so much time in my hands now and my mind’s been drifting. With everything that’s going on, reading the news, posts and hearing opinions left and right, it’s quite hard to digest everything. But when it happens, it suddenly hits you. Anxiety, tension, the feeling of unease. All forms of fear.  That’s when I realized…  1. How powerful our minds can be. When I kept myself up to date with the news and fed my mind with only the negative things, I tend to absorb it differently—as if the shortness of breath is from complete paranoia or from what I pray isn’t. But one day, I decided to change my state of mind and pull myself out of the darkness— mentally. I  made a conscious effort of being aware of the situation but not feeding my fear. Getting up every morning and being optimistic makes a huge difference.  2. How you can choose to be strong instead of being aggressive. Situations such as this can unleash so much emotion. The main thing I’ve been seeing around is anger, which is completely understandable. I’ve been feeling it quite often too. But just because the pain we’re going through is valid, doesn’t mean negative actions are acceptable. I try to keep that in mind when I’m in the mood to add fuel to the fire.  3. I’m a loner. I’ve always been a loner. But now more than ever, I enjoy being with my loved ones when I’m done being in my shell.  I realized that I’ve spent a lot of time worrying about insignificant things   4. We must be kind to one another. Online. And offline. We all come from different backgrounds and we all react differently. We only understand from our level of perception so maybe we don’t know what’s really going on with a person. When I read something negative, it made me think that maybe this person’s at home feeling miserable, or maybe he or she is misunderstood. Maybe this person needs an outlet. Everyone has their own way of coping. But, we should be responsible of what we say and do both online and offline. It’s easy to post and pass judgment. It’s easy to react without thinking. It wouldn’t hurt if people chose to be kinder or if people would think before they type. And rethink before they click… is it true? Is it necessary? Is it kind?   5. Everything that has happened is a wake up call. I realized that I’ve spent a lot of time worrying about insignificant things. There are bigger things out there that need everyone’s time, effort and energy. We never know if tomorrow is promised to us, so let’s concentrate on things that truly matter: relationships, health, healing, humanity.

Skincare Slowdown: A DJ-approved playlist for your nighttime routine,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/360742/skincare-slowdown-a-dj-approved-playlist-for-your-nighttime-routine/,"04:32 PM April 08, 2020","I’ve noticed that people are taking advantage of their work-from-home life by doing at least an hour-long skincare routine. Sans the commute, you can finally perform the multi-step regime that involves essence, lip treatment, and perhaps a glass of wine. Some are going for leisurely showers or even drawing up a bath. Break out the body scrub and lotion scents you got last Christmas. Now you can let the scent of wild roses that transport you to sunny days in France. I’ve seen the Instagram Stories featuring a fizzling bath bomb one too many times to know I’m right. This is why I asked DJ Alexandra of Bad Decisions to compose a playlist to enhance your self-pampering while in self-quarantine session. It will give you something to sway to while in your bathrobes. You’ll get songs to soothe you as you massage in that serum or to help you remember how long to keep that mud mask on. I also checked in with the DJ what’s up with her while on lockdown. What’s your current home routine? Any special task you’ve been liking? 
On a good day, I’d wake up around 10 am. I’ve been really busy the past few months just before the lockdown, so it really feels good to wake up without an alarm. I’d usually just lay in bed for a good 30 minutes, just scrolling on my phone or watching Netflix. Then I’d will myself to work out for at least 20 minutes and then make myself lunch. I’ve been meaning to cook for quite some time, but I never really had the chance to since I was busy with school and DJing. But with the quarantine situation, I’ve finally found the time to up my cooking skills. I cook while listening to new music or mixtapes made by my friends. It’s very therapeutic. I’ve been trying to educate myself with genres I’m not too familiar with and go deeper into genres that I am familiar with. I also feel like working out and eating healthy is the best way to boost your health both physically and mentally, which we all need at this time. I also talk to my friends and family every day, just to check-in. I feel blessed to just be at home despite the current situation outside, so I just try to be productive as much as possible — it helps me stay positive. On that note, I’ve also been taking online French lessons which I think is really interesting. I’ve been meaning to get back to painting, so I’m excited about that too. What recent music releases are now your favorites?
I’ve always been a fan of Jhene Aiko, and her new album ‘Chilombo’ just came out! They also released Mac Miller’s ‘Circles‘ album this year, which is just really beautiful. I’ve also been listening to Jason Dhakal’s ‘lovesound‘ album and “Checklist‘ by Kylo X, Malli and Hijo.  What’s your skincare routine?
For skincare, I usually just go with the bare minimum. Before going to bed, I’d wash up with my Shiseido Clarifying Cleansing Foam then apply my witch hazel toner. I’ve also traded my moisturizer for facial oils. I use either rosehip or sunflower oil. Then I apply my Kiehl’s Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado. On some nights, I’d swap my facial oil and eye cream with my Laneige Water Sleeping Mask, then I’d just rinse it off in the morning. The last thing I do is put on hand cream. I feel like it’s just a nice finishing touch.

How to Make the Most of Your Home Workouts,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/360402/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-home-workouts/,"11:00 PM April 02, 2020","In the past 72 hours, I have been recruited for three different fitness challenges over Instagram. From push-up to burpee challenges, I feel like more and more people are being encouraged to try out home workout routines. This makes me incredibly happy! Although this is a great step forward in leading and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, there are ways to make sure you’re making the most of your home workouts during this lockdown. Here are my top tips and tricks in making the most of your at-home sweat sessions. Unless you are a fitness professional or have an extensive background working out, I highly recommend you don’t just jump into doing intense workouts without seeking some guidance first. The good news is there are a whole lot of coaches, athletes, and fitness gyms and studios that are posting home workouts online. Check out your favorite gym and fitness influencers on Instagram to see what they’re doing. I would start by looking for programs formulated by certified pros and pick routines that fit your fitness level or at least offer modifications for making it easier or more difficult. This way you can customize the difficulty to your own comfort level. Although, I do recommend you push yourself, so you are challenged! Plenty of the exercise challenges I see online are explosive moves and people tend to rush through the movements as quickly as possible. There are a time and place for these kinds of exercises, but I recommend focusing on getting the best time under tension. Meaning rather than getting as many reps as possible in the shortest time possible, try to get as many slow quality reps in until your muscles give up. Try this—do 10 quick pushups as quickly as possible. Then do another 10, but as slow as possible. I bet you the latter is much more difficult. That also allows you to carefully focus on your form. The proper form is always more important than a high number of reps. It’s not how much you lift, rather it’s HOW you lift. Not many people have home gyms. That’s normal, so you have to get a little creative with your movements and learn to improvise by making items in your home into gym equipment. You can get an intense, full-body workout by simply utilizing your body weight and no equipment at all. That works! However, if you’d like to amp it up, you can use everyday household items as replacements for gym equipment. For example, you can use water bottles or canned goods in various sizes as different weights; socks or hand towels on floors as sliders; edges of the door frame as a pull-up bar; two chairs as dip bars; and so on. You can explore what you have at home and get creative. Whether it’s indoors, outdoors, at the gym or at your home, the key to a successful workout program is sticking to it. I recommend you do some sort of cardio—walking around, jumping rope, running around doing chores—every day, and then some sort of strength training every other day. I also keep a journal of my workouts that logs what exercises I do; how many reps and sets I complete; and what muscle group I work out that day. That way I can see my progress, and also monitor what I’ve worked out so far to make sure I am balanced in exercising and resting different parts of my body. If you’re at the beginning of your fitness journey, a journal may seem a bit much, but I guarantee you that it is one simple and magical tool in keeping you consistently working out. Studies show that having a workout buddy can greatly improve your chances of sticking to a workout program. Get your significant other, kids or roommate to join you for your next sweat session. Even if they don’t join you right away, my best guess is that because of the house arrest, they might just eventually join you out of boredom. But what if I’m at home alone? That’s okay too because that’s where social media and technology can come into play. During this worldwide lockdown, I’m in Washington D.C. yet I work out with friends in LA and Manila every other day via Zoom video conferencing. This is also the beauty of Instagram fitness challenges—your friends challenge you to work out and post it, and you do the same. It’s a healthy cycle of encouragement, that keeps you moving every day even if all you feel like doing is to binge on Netflix. Really though—with all the time we have now, you can do both!  Whether you are a fitness newbie or veteran, having to be at home all the time and be as healthy as possible despite being indoors, is new territory for everyone. Fitness professionals are being forced to step out of the comfort of their gyms. Those who don’t usually workout are now realizing that it’s more important now than ever to stay fit and healthy. Health and wellness practices date way back before fancy gyms and activewear. Although the circumstances are not the best, I like the idea of simplifying fitness and making it accessible again to everyone. One thing is for sure, the revitalization of the home workout validates my belief that as long as we all stick together and show everyone in our community kindness and support, we will be resilient and get through this.

9 ways to master your newfound LDR,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/359741/9-ways-to-master-your-newfound-ldr/,"03:09 PM March 23, 2020","One of my friends posted how she and her boyfriend of several years finally know what a long-distance relationship (LDR) is like due to our current situation. Social distancing and home quarantine mean that everyone is dating and keeping up with their significant other online. Cultivating a relationship online has its perks. It also adds a different dimension to how you know each other. I also believe that time apart is always healthy in any relationship. Heed the words of sage Ariana Grande: “I can’t really miss you if I’m with you/And when I miss you, it’ll change the way I kiss you.”  If you’re new to the LDR world or just looking for ways to spice it up, I’ve listed down a few things you and your boo could do. You can watch a movie or binge on a new TV show via Netflix Party. No fighting for the blanket with this one or getting stuck in the awkward position. You also don’t need to be chatting online all the time. Sometimes I write an article (oops, busted!) while my partner cuts a video for work. It stimulates the feeling of being in the same room. Plus, you can easily ask each other some help when a bit stuck with your respective tasks. A standard with online love. You can cook the same dish if you want to or just go with each other’s favorites. Set the table and place your chosen device opposite you in a manner that would mimic your partner sitting across the table. Don’t let the video calls become a routine. A classic voice call can feel intimate. Your imagination can run a little bit, giving your that old school, “I talked to my baby on the telephone, long-distance” feel.  Learn from the YouTube vloggers: Change your backdrop. It makes for an instant conversation starter. It also gives some stimulation to both of you. If you haven’t done it yet, IRL: Give each other a home tour! Depending on your connection, some apps perform better than others. Sometimes, the performance changes from day-to-day. So play around with Skype, Google Duo, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and so on. Randomly leave messages on any of these apps and allow your SO to reply on a different platform. Currently, I’m liking House Party. You can play games like Quick Draw!, Heads Up!, and Trivia. Install the app on your phone and add it as a Google Chrome Extension. It may sound fundamental, but talking to each other via headphones does help make the call feel more personal. Plus, it cancels out noise and the “What did you say?” transgressions. Another practical suggestion, but it’s something to take note of truly. You don’t want to cut the conversation short just because your hand gets tired or subject yourself to weird angels as you chat.  Just like in real life, one must schedule video dates after work and personal chores. But don’t be afraid to call out of the blue, even just to say hi or give each other quick updates. Leave a voice mail if the person doesn’t pick up. The secret to dating this way is to build it up the whole day as if you’re going to meet. Ask who will pick up who and where you will go. Try not to tell each other what’s going on in your day or whatever pops into your head. Save it for the date. Volunteer to bring over some wine if it’s going to be a date at home. An hour before, text that “I’m just waiting for the car to come to pick me up.” Put some makeup on, wear that lovely dress, and a necklace. For guys, go the extra mile by busting out that excellent and well-ironed shirt. Put some gel into that hair. No matter how long you’ve been together, it’s always fun and refreshing to know you still gussy up and get a bit nervous when you see each other even just via your laptop screen. There you have it! You can always create your own ways to make your LDR interesting. Ask each other to do an avatar for the other one and make one for yourself so you can compare the results. Ask your parents how they went about phone calls in the ’90s. You never know what advice they have!  8 tasks you’ve been putting off that you can finally do while in self-quarantine  30 Instagram Stories templates to play with and share     CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2020
"Treat Yo Self, And Stay On Diet This Holiday Season",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/353938/treat-yo-self-and-stay-on-diet-this-holiday-season/,"06:52 PM December 20, 2019","With Christmas just a few days away, the holiday partying and feasting is at its peak. Typically, this means absolute trouble for one’s diet. Indulging this festive season is quite normal, however, one doesn’t have to completely “fall off the wagon” in terms of healthy eating. I’m a firm believer that in times wherein you know you cannot strictly adhere to your usual proper diet and workout routine, it’s even more crucial to find balance. What do I mean by balance? Since you may have a high-calorie meal at a dinner party, perhaps it’s even more important to get your workout in the next morning or maybe fast till lunch. Since you know that you will be having sugary desserts and cocktails at a social gathering, perhaps make sure the next few meals that are not so indulgent. When I say balance, I mean we should counter the “bad stuff” with the good stuff. The other approach to balance is if you have healthier alternatives to commonly unhealthy items. I love this option because I can thoroughly enjoy my favorite treats, but not go on the downward spiral of the all-or-nothing mentality. With this in mind, there a few not-so-unhealthy treats that I’ve learned to love that make for perfect gifts or desserts to share with others at your Friendsmas gathering or ‘Noche Buena’ meal. Check them out!   This cake has been a hit with everyone I’ve had try so far. I even have a friend who thought I was joking when I said it has zero sugar and zero net carbs. Yes, it is true—this tiramisu is both vegan and keto. This is one of the few sweet offerings from Athlete’s Bite, a customized meal preparation service that specializes in meals for in-competition athletes and patients suffering from medical conditions. With that in mind, you can be assured that this is truly a healthy dessert with only the best ingredients. And, after having tried it, I know it’s a quite tasty one as well!  I’m not the biggest fan of fruit cake, but because of its popularity especially during the holidays, this baked goody has grown on me. I’ve had many different kinds, and by far, this tastes better than the others. This may be because of the high-quality ingredients used. All ingredients used in Simply Healthy Manila are organic, vegan, and refined sugar-free, making their treats quite delicious, and guilt-free. I’ve also tried their Food for Gods, and that’s a good one for holiday gatherings as well!  Keto Pint is new to the Philippine market, and it’s the first keto-certified premium ice cream. I recently had the pleasure to try the coffee flavor, and I was thoroughly impressed. Coffee is my all-time favorite ice cream flavor, so let’s just say that I’ve had a good share of different kinds of coffee ice cream. Despite this being healthy, it was creamy and flavorful. I would highly recommend replacing your traditionally high-fat and high-sugar ice cream for this. They also come in other flavors like strawberry, peanut butter cup, mint chocolate chip and more.  This has to be my ultimate favorite healthy alternative to a dessert. I tempted to call it simply a dessert rather than a healthy alternative because of how scrumptious this is. Snickers is one of my favorite candies, so when I heard the Athlete’s Bite had a Snickers cake, somehow, I knew it was going to be divine. And it is! I may have finished this cake all in one sitting. And, by myself. Yes, I have no trouble admitting that and I feel no guilt because this is also refined sugar-free and made with all-natural premium ingredients. Yes, share it with others. This is a season of sharing delectable treats and holiday cheer. I find it extremely important to partake in social gatherings and taking time to celebrate. That too is part of being healthy and living a well-balanced life. With that said, just know that there are so many awesome healthy foods out there, that are as yummy as your traditional treats. Especially during this festive season, I encourage you to be healthy and share that wealth with others. Happy Holidays!

Yoga in prison: another life choice for inmates,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/352296/yoga-in-prison-another-life-choice-for-inmates/,"01:17 PM December 04, 2019","BANGKOK — Prison life by its definition may be limiting and yes, painful, too, as the minutes tick by slowly with little to occupy the mind or body. For the fortunate few, there are a number of volunteers doing projects in prisons including art activities, knitting, making furniture, making Buddha statues, all activities that could lead to income-earning work once they are released. There’s yoga too though that appears to be less-accepted on the outside. The Prison Yoga Project is being run by Thirawan Watthanothai, former dean of the Faculty of Architecture, Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi (RMUTT) and introduced in 2011 at Ratchaburi Central Prison before expanding to other prisons. She also plans to initiate a yoga practice project for men in prisons. After more than 8 years of running her yoga program in prisons, Thirawan is determined to continue and expand, noting that it has been shown to be useful to the inmates. “Ninety percent of the inmates who come to practice yoga have their own unique abilities and what we need to do is encourage society to accept them once they are released. Most yoga studios refuse to give them work even if they pass the test. I want society to give people an opportunity. There was a case of a female inmate in Udon Thani, whose foreign boyfriend helped her move to Switzerland an even opened a yoga studio for her. She was proud that she learned yoga at the prison, “said Thirawan who started to learn yoga with an Indian instructor after overworking, feeling stressed and unable to sleep. The idea to launch yoga in prison came about after she helped a fellow teacher prepare a report on life in prison and discovered the levels of stress from which female inmates suffer. She felt yoga could be the answer and set off on a journey to get her idea accepted. It took a while but Thirawan was determined. “We ask the officers to select young people serving long sentences for yoga practice. If we want to mould them into yoga teachers, they must study from 9am to 2pm every day for several months. We saw how it improved not just their state of mind but also helped with lowering blood sugar. After three weeks, the body adapts and the students want to continue. We selected 25 people to teach yoga, most of them with 20 years to run on their jail terms. Prison administrators and staff cooperate to organize morning yoga classes for female inmates. ” India, America, England, Australia and Scandinavia have also expressed interest in using yoga as part of their jail rehabilitation programmes and studies have shown that prisoners who have been practicing yoga enjoy positive physical and mental or even spiritual health. Research in US prisons has found that yoga helps with concentration, makes the body and mind relax and reduces stress and anxiety. Patcharee Mungmai, 30, a former inmate was given the opportunity to teach yoga to other inmates. She said that yoga is very helpful to her because while she was in prison, she almost lost her mind. “In prison, the scariest thing is not being beaten but the possibility of going insane. Yoga really made us more conscious. I was sentenced to 16 years and 8 months, but only served 8 years and 1 day. I was arrested during my 4th year in university as part of a drug round up,” she says. Today she is a speaker on drug prevention at the probation office in Ubon Ratchathani Province.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
Saying “Yes” to refills and “No” to landfills,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/351683/saying-yes-to-refills-and-no-to-landfills/,"02:32 PM November 26, 2019","This generation’s notion in adopting an environmentally-sensitive approach in consumer products has introduced the advent of eco-friendly alternatives to plastic straws, bags, and utensils. But the fundamental issue here goes deeper than what’s fashionable or “in” and it needs to be immediately addressed. The alarming number of marine animals who die or get injured because of plastic trash has moved Discovery Shores Boracay and Club Paradise Palawan into establishing their own Corporate Social Responsibility or CSR initiative called “EcoConserve” program.  This program covers all environment-friendly practices that have been incorporated into the daily aspects of both resorts’ operations to help lessen the properties’ ecological impacts.  A major component of which is the resorts’ goal of minimizing plastic trash.  From small practices like the replacement of plastic straws with paper or metal ones, the use of refillable pumps for the bath amenities, to bigger and more long-term applications like the installation of a more sustainable source of drinking water, both resorts are committed to finding ways to better care for the environment. This 2019, Discovery Shores Boracay and Club Paradise Palawan have invested in EcoPure Water Bottling System that transforms tap water to clean drinking water. The system makes use of Classic Crystal Tropical Purification technology which includes a seven-stage water purification system that destroys microorganism and other harmful substances that may be present in tap water. The resulting EcoPure water is pure and safe for drinking and comes in either still or sparkling. The EcoPure water is elegantly packaged in hygienic glass bottles that are sterilized before and after use.  This new water system eliminates the resorts’ need for commercially sold bottled drinking water. The use of glass bottles also completely takes away any health concerns arising from plastic chemicals leaching into the drinking water. According to several studies published in www.gogreen.org, the production of plastic water bottles requires up to 17 million barrels of oil each year, enough to maintain up to one million cars fueled for an entire year. It also uses energy that can power 190,000 homes, not to mention three times the amount of water needed in the production of one plastic water bottle. That large amount of water used becomes unusable due to its exposure to chemicals during the production process. Once the water in the plastic bottle is consumed, it takes 700 years for one PET plastic bottle to start decomposing. Last year, both resorts consume an average of 12,542 bottles of water per month. The use of EcoPure water system will eliminate the use of plastic bottles which can save both resorts and the environment a total 150,504 plastic bottles in one year.

I’m not eating Samgyeopsal anymore,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/347729/im-not-eating-samgyeopsal-anymore/,"03:39 PM October 08, 2019"," Ever since I discovered Samgyeopsal, I became an instant fan. Samgyeopsal is basically pork belly meat that is cooked on a grill and is originally from Korea. It was one of the most interesting developments in South Korean culture during the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 that gave the pork belly the spotlight in South Korean barbeque. Pork belly is a cheaper alternative to beef and thus, South Koreans ate more at pork belly joints than beef barbeque restaurants. The Samgyeopsal craze has hit the Philippines. Samgyeopsal joints in the country are popping up like mushrooms. For around P300 to P500, one can enjoy an unlimited pork or meat assortment that you cook through the grill on your table. There are also a lot of side dishes that waiters place on your table like sweet potatoes, kimchi, japchae, fish cakes, and even steamed egg. Honestly, I don’t eat the side dishes and just have the waiter put them back so they don’t get thrown away. I wonder if other people do the same. This also got me thinking about how some upper to middle class Filipinos could spend so much on food and even possibly have unlimited amounts of this at their disposal, while there is an ongoing crisis in Philippine agriculture. Around the country, we still have food wastage through plate waste. The latest 2015 survey of FNRI (Food and Nutrition Research Institute) showed that a Filipino household has an average food plate waste of 62 grams or 4 tablespoons per day. Cereals and cereal products were highest at 46 grams; fish, meat & poultry is at 8 grams; vegetables at 5 grams; and fruits at 1 gram among others. Additionally, the 2018 Global Food Security Index (GFSI) places the country 70th among 113 countries in terms of food security. Food security is measured by the GFSI in terms of affordability, availability, and quality and safety. The GFSI placed the Philippines in the lower rankings since we lack research and development in agriculture. The agriculture sector is really in a dismal state. One indicator is looking at the sector’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth. In the second quarter of 2019, the agriculture sector had a 0.6% growth rate with the fishing subsector contributing to this, while crops like palay and corn had a negative growth of 5.5% and 8.4% respectively. Moreover, by looking at the proposed 2020 budget, the agriculture sector only garnered a 1.6% share in the total budget compared to infrastructure with 16.6% and defense with 9.1%. I guess improving the agriculture sector’s productivity is really not on the agenda. The irony of eating at a Samgyeopsal joint while we’re having an agricultural crisis isn’t just what bothers me about these places. There’s also an environmental aspect. For one, you’re using charcoal to cook your food and where does the vacuum expel the gases produced from charcoal? Literally, outside. Charcoal emits around 4.9 kilograms of carbon dioxide for an hour of grilling compared to a gas grill that emits only about 2.5 kilograms of carbon dioxide. Now imagine how many tables per hour emit 4.9 kilograms of carbon dioxide in just one Samgyeopsal joint. Second, is the disposal of oil produced from these grills. The fat from meat goes under the charcoal grill and is collected to be “properly” disposed later. Normally, these establishments should have proper grease or oil disposal procedures. But if they just pour this down the drain or into the sewerage, it’s an environmental disaster waiting to happen. Business establishments have a problem with proper waste disposal even with guidelines and laws in place. One way to know if they dispose of their grease or oil improperly is if the sewers around the establishment smell horrible. Looking back at the impact of eating meat amidst an agriculture and environmental crisis, I hate to say it, but I may have to apologize to the titas of IBON for making fun of them for eating organic vegetables. They have always said that eating organic vegetables is healthier and better for the environment plus it supports our local farmers. But organic food does not come cheap since farmers do not own the land they till, lack capital, and have no genuine government support. That’s why there is a need to support our farmers through agrarian reform and long-term efforts of rural development. (Jose Lorenzo Lim is a researcher at IBON Foundation.

Here’s how you can maintain an active lifestyle in Nuvali,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/347465/heres-how-you-can-maintain-an-active-lifestyle-in-nuvali/,"12:21 PM October 05, 2019"," In 2009, Nuvali started out as a bare 1,800 -hectare estate. Since then it has developed into an ever-growing sustainable community within a 2,290-hectare enclave, complete with various recreational activities that cater to different fields of interest and different age groups. Here are five ways to have a healthy and active lifestyle within the eco-city of Nuvali. For the Adrenaline Junkies Republ1c Wakepark is Nuvali’s world-class wakeboarding destination where adrenaline junkies and sports enthusiasts can head out to for quick and convenient weekend fun. It is a cable park which means wakeboarding in Nuvali involves cables and not boats. Just hold on to the handle, hit the water, and the cable pulls you through the water. Having two wakeboard lakes, it caters to both newbies and experienced wakeboarders. For the newbies, there are professionals and teachers available at the wakepark to give lessons and have you up on the boards in no time. Obstacles and ramps are available for experienced and advanced riders to make things more challenging and exciting. For those in touch with nature The Wildlife & Bird Sanctuary, a 17-km long buffer green and forest zone throughout Nuvali, is accessible for anyone that wants to get in touch with nature.  This area of the estate will be conserved, as no establishment will be built upon it in order to preserve the greenery and allow wildlife to thrive and develop. The sanctuary is also conducive to an eco-friendly lifestyle and at the same time gives people an opportunity to appreciate nature. Within the sanctuary, there are observation decks, which all are suitable for bird watching. In addition to this, there are also lakeside activities available in Nuvali, among them is the fish feeding.  For those looking to live an active lifestyle Nuvali is known for fostering a union of ecological, social, and economic sustainability in the aspects of living. It is unique for being an estate in which an eco-friendly and active lifestyle is attainable. The estate offers Lakeside activities around a 4-hectare multi-functional lake feature where biking and jogging lanes can be found. The lake itself also serves as a catchment for stormwater run-off, a water reservoir and rainwater catchment basin, and a fire reserve. Also known for having lush greenery and surroundings, Nuvali is an ideal place to pursue your passion and drive for fitness with mountain biking is one activity readily available to the public. The bike trails are beginner-friendly because they are mainly flat. However, there are also some trails that have some climbs but do not require a high level of endurance nor stamina. For the more seasoned riders, there are more challenging trails that occasionally twist and are single tracks with a few short slopes, bumps, and roots.  For those in need of rest & relaxation Across the different recreational activities and venues in Nuvali there are locations where people can sit, relax, or have picnics. You can pick a spot around the lakeside and spread a picnic blanket on the grounds and sit and enjoy the view by yourself or with friends, without having to spend a thing. Within the Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary, there are mini man-made lagoons where you can take a rest and have the opportunity to observe some birds while you’re at it.  For a one of a kind outdoor adventure Within the heart of Nuvali lies “Camp N,” an outdoor adventure and team-building hub that encourages self-discovery through obstacles and challenges testing one’s physical limits, mental abilities, and even character and values. It is a convenient location for bonding among co-workers, families, and friends, as well as an adventure zone that encourages individuals to step out of their comfort zone, try something new and overcome their fears.

‘Drink up’—Tang urges Filipinos to stay fully hydrated even in rainy season,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/334673/drink-up-tang-urges-filipinos-to-stay-hydrated-even-in-rainy-season/,"06:00 PM September 23, 2019","The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has officially declared the start of rainy season in the Philippines. During this time, rainfall and typhoons are expected to hit the country. Due to the sudden change of weather, diseases triggered or worsened by the cold weather may rise. While most Filipinos are prepared to combat common diseases such as cough and colds, some may overlook the issue on dehydration, which is still considered a risk even during this season. Dehydration occurs when the amount of fluids consumed is less than what the body needs to function properly. It is also during rainy season, when sweating caused by the humidity in the air, or long exposure to cool places, can put anyone at risk of dehydration. During this time, people often drink less water because of the cold weather. This diminished thirst response together with increased urine production contribute as major factors to dehydration. This is why even in cold or rainy weather, anyone can be susceptible to dehydration—especially kids. Young children are more prone to dehydration than adults for various reasons. Generally, children are more physically active than most adults. During physical activities, children may not immediately feel the sensation of thirst or postpone drinking even when they are thirsty because they are so excited to play. Thus, they are failing to drink beverages to replace lost fluids in the body.  Parents should therefore ensure that their children stay hydrated since a study conducted by FNRI-DOST states that 8 out of 10 Filipino school children are not getting enough fluids to keep them hydrated and healthy.  Parents should be informed of the value of proper hydration in children—that it promotes physical and mental well-being. They should be fully aware of the signs of dehydration in young children such as cracked dry lips, cold and dry skin, excessive sleepiness, and low energy level even during playtime. Dehydration might cause lack of mental awareness and concentration which could affect their performance in school, and even their willingness to interact with other children. In the long term, not drinking enough water may lead to chronic dehydration which could have dangerous and life-threatening effects such as kidney stones, urinary tract infection (UTI), low or undetectable blood pressure, and can even lead to death when left untreated. A child’s fluid requirement varies depending on factors such as age, sex, level of physical activity, air temperature, and preexisting medical condition. About 20% of our total water intake comes from food, while 80% comes from drinking beverages. Ideally, school age children should drink at least 5-7 glasses of water. For teenage boys, at least 9-10 glasses of water and for girls, at least 7-8 glasses of water per day. However, the child’s level of physical activity greatly impacts their fluid requirement.   When sweating is excessive, beverages fortified with essential vitamins and minerals help with recovery. Tang is an enjoyable way to refresh your kids after physical activities. Tang is a delicious and refreshing thirst-quenching drink. It has 100% Vitamin C and has real fruit goodness that kids love! INQUIRER.net BrandRoom/LA  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
Sex at sixty-two,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/344538/sex-at-sixty-two/,"07:19 PM September 01, 2019","Dear Dr. G, I am from the generation of baby boomer who has just passed my sixth decade of life. Born shortly after Malaysian Independence, I am reflecting on my life’s journey from midlife crisis and beyond. Many of my contemporaries tell me it’s time to wind down and contemplate looking after the grandchildren. On the contrary, my wife and I are still going from strength to strength, especially in the bedroom department. Despite being in my early 60s, I am still getting morning woods and good libido. Okay, it’s not like we are still at it like in the teenage years. However, from the mid-40s to this day, there is no sign of slowing down. My friends think it is abnormal to still have an active sex life at this age. On that note, I would like to put Dr. G on the spot on the issues of sex at 60s: Can you please tell me whether it is normal to be sexually driven at this age? Is the active sex life harmful to us at this age? I know I am lucky to still have the morning glory at 60. I also hope you can tell me the way for me to sustain the morning (and nighttime) glory for many more years to come? Finally, would like to take this opportunity to wish the Malaysia a Happy 62nd birthday! Yours truly, Glory Gordon Baby boomers are the cohort of generation widely associated with growing up during a period of increasing affluence and privileges. As the post-World War generation, individuals born between 1946 and 1964, baby boomers benefited from government subsidies in housing and education. Undoubtedly, people from this era were wealthier and physically fitter than preceding generations. Enjoying peak levels of income, abundance of food, retirement programs and even “midlife-crisis” products, the baby boomers are often criticized for the excessive increase in consumerism. As the baby boomers advanced into the golden years, the over-indulgence has indeed witnessed many suffering from non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. Aging with such challenges in health clearly has its negative impact in the bedroom. On the other hand, the baby boomers taking advantage of improved nutrition and fitness can enjoy longevity both inside and outside the bedroom. Sexual health is an integral part of overall health. In fact, there is even evidence that keeping the love flames going will have overall benefit for physical and mental well-being. One study in 2016 revealed that enhanced sexual activities for couples aged 50 and 89 is associated with improved cognitive functions. While men demonstrated better aptitude in remembering number sequences, women also enjoyed better memory overall following increased sexual frequency. Many studies also highlighted the “mature” form of sex may evolve with advancing age, as intimacy may not necessary lead to penetrative intercourse like in the younger days. Sex becomes more affectionate as the urgent lust of youthful sex dissipates. However, many couples living healthy lifestyles, with undiminished appetite for sex and the matching stamina for penetrative intercourse, continue to experience “blazing inferno” in the bedroom well into the golden years and beyond. There are a number of measures couples can take to keep the romance alive in their 60s. Of course, being physically and mentally healthy can make action between the sheets somewhat effortless. Great nutrition and active lifestyle can maintain agility and keep your love life going from strength to strength. On the other hand, women having vaginal dryness after menopause may also benefit from lubrication and hormonal replacement, while men with compromised erection may rise to the occasions with the assistance of the blue pill. Confucius once said: “Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.” As men (and women) age, the inevitable physical and fitness changes in the body often have a negative impact on sexual relationship. Facing the obstacles of ED and vaginal dryness often times render the acceptance of “sexless lives” in couples 60s and beyond. Dr. G is rarely put on the spot by inspirational couples continuing to enjoy vibrant sex into the sixty-too. In the spirit of a nation celebrating sixty-two years of glory, his advice about keeping the glorious action well into Golden Years is: “Our greatest glory is not in accepting the falling, but keeping fit and rising to all occasions!” On that note, have a glorious Merdeka Weekend!

Parklinks: Living amidst nature at Eton and Ayala Land’s greenest urban estate,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/344399/parklinks-living-amidst-nature-at-eton-and-ayala-lands-greenest-urban-estate/,"02:22 PM August 31, 2019","  Sustainable mixed-use estates designed with greenery and where everything is within walking distance—or at least an easy 10-minute drive—have that irresistible appeal to those who call this bustling yet crowded metropolis home.  Many city dwellers have therefore become more discerning when it comes to choosing a community to live in.  Many are putting more effort in living an active and healthy lifestyle, wanting the right balance to counter the stress that living in this concrete jungle is bringing to their lives.  It is no longer enough that one lives in a snazzy high-rise. Green is in and sustainability is the magic word when it comes to picking a neighborhood to build a home and start a family. A joint project of Eton Properties Philippines Inc. (EPPI) and Ayala Land Inc. (ALI), Parklinks is a sustainable mixed-use development rising in Pasig and Quezon City which promises green, sustainable living alongside life’s modern conveniences.  It will capitalize on the natural features of the Marikina River to be incorporated into high quality urban green spaces. The 35-hectare estate is thoughtfully master-planned to be the greenest urban estate in the metro as 50 percent of Parklinks will be dedicated to open spaces, and easy access to parks and open spaces will be a priority.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has always highlighted the importance of green spaces and wetlands as “a fundamental component of any urban ecosystem.”  Gardens, parks and sports fields motivate physical activity, promote recreation and encourage social interaction. People are inspired to walk when streets and avenues are lined with trees and plants, rather than take their cars and add to the already congested streets.  According to the WHO, “physical inactivity, linked to poor walkability and lack of access to recreational areas, accounts for 3.3 percent of global deaths.” Aside from benefiting one’s physical health, the WHO also pointed out the importance of green spaces to one’s mental well-being.  “Some analysis suggests that physical activity in a natural environment can help remedy mild depression and reduce physiological stress indicators,” the WHO said. Parklinks is designed with various zones where one can relax, engage, play, learn, appreciate and observe nature.  One will find an experiential garden, waterfront entertainment, an outdoor amphitheater and an iconic bridge which will connect Quezon City and Pasig City. There will also be an active and passive park with an interactive sculpture and a grand central lawn that will be lined with restaurants and cafes that will surely delight every foodie.  Spaces for play and leisure such as a multipurpose lawn, a play lawn, an eco walk and a viewing deck that provides a peaceful and relaxing view of the Marikina River can also be found here. Plant enthusiasts can troop to Parklinks’ nursery and public seeding market.  An herb garden and cafe will serve farm to table gastronomic delights. More waterfront open spaces, a boardwalk, and play and exercise stations to inspire physical activity will also be included in the design. The estate will be home to Ayala Land Premier’s first luxury residential development along the C5 corridor.  Parklinks North Tower will be facing the Marikina River and will feature a pool deck and outdoor lounge, allowing residents relaxing and tranquil views of the water.  Residential projects by Alveo Land and Avida Land will also rise in Parklinks. The lifestyle mall with 52,000 sqm of leasable space will serve as the anchor of the residential and business hub.  It is envisioned to provide a whole new family-oriented lifestyle experience with its wide array of retail, dining and entertainment options set amidst the surrounding greenery of Parklinks.  It will be situated at the estate’s C5 frontage and is expected to be completed in 2023. Staying true to the estate’s commitment to support a more active and healthy lifestyle to its residents and visitors, Parklink’s mall will also feature a 3,500 sqm sports complex that will be comprised of a basketball court, volleyball court, badminton courts and a fitness gym. Phase 1 of Parklinks will also have three office towers in the pipeline. The first office project will be stacked on top of the Parklinks Mall that will offer a seamless mall experience for office workers and visitors.  The estate’s roads, utilities and land development are now at 85 percent completion.  Parklinks’ signature 110-meter long and 25-meter wide signature bridge is expected to be finished by early 2021, along with the Eco Terraces and the Visitors’ Center.  The Esplanade and the ALP tower are seen to be completed in 2025.  Parklinks is accessible via major thoroughfares: C5, Amang Rodriguez Avenue and Ortigas Avenue.  It is also set to benefit from a 4-lane elevated flyover that will bypass the busy intersections of Eastwood and Greenmeadows which is part of the government’s Metro Manila Interchanges Construction Project Phase IV.  Future residents of the metro’s greenest urban estate need not worry, too, about getting to major central business districts such as the Makati Business District, Bonifacio Global City, Ortigas Center and Triangle Park in Quezon City. Imagine the promise of being spared from the ordeal that is Metro Manila traffic and being allowed the convenience of living near your office, commercial establishments and places of leisure.  Think of spending every day in a well-designed development where you can walk among trees and have your morning runs through parks and open spaces. Clearly, city dwellers should watch out for Parklinks, poised to be the greenest and healthiest neighborhood this side of the metro.

Coca-Cola officials also presented a World Without Waste installation to the Davao City Vice Mayor: the installation features the beverage brand’s iconic bottle collection bin; a bench made from 1,000 recycled PET bottles and a collection bin made from 600 plastic PET bottles from Winder Recycling Company, a Davao-based partner which gives used plastic bottles a new life by converting them into high-value products, such as school chairs and benches. “We are excited to be part of the annual Kadayawan Festival—not only through celebrating life, health, and prosperity, but also by enriching the festivities through our activities geared toward environmental conservation,” said Atty. Tañada. “We see the warm welcome of our presence at Kadayawan as an opportunity to further promote a cleaner and greener way of living, most especially during a celebration so important to Davaoeños. We hope that this will be the start of a long-term partnership with the Davao City government, which we recognize as a partner in ensuring the welfare of the environment.” The first World Without Waste installation has already been unveiled at Magsaysay Park—and installations at People’s Park, Rizal Park, Botanical Garden, and Sta. Ana Wharf are soon to follow. To further encourage the active participation of local residents and tourists, and to translate on-the-ground awareness onto social media, the #betterbottlecapchallenge will run from August 21 to 25. Contributors will be capturing, through photographs and video, the unique and creative ways in which they’ve deposited their used plastic PET bottles in designated Coca-Cola collection bins, and posting these on their social media accounts with the hashtag. Those who complete the challenge will receive a Coca-Cola beverage which they can personalize with their names. Coca-Cola Philippines is also celebrating the Kadayawan Festival with exciting and immersive activities that will allow Davaoeños and tourists to enjoy the taste of original Filipino music and the region’s delicious local food. A Coke Studio concert will be held on August 24 at Sta. Ana Wharf, featuring local artists and is sure to delight festival-goers with well-loved OPM songs. CCBPI is proud to help steer the environmentally-responsible observance of a festival so close to the hearts of Davaoeños. The Company is grateful for the participation of local residents and festival-goers, and for the unwavering support of the local government in furthering the collective World Without Waste advocacy.

The ‘Green Choice’: 9 budget-friendly ways for families to embrace the organic diet,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/342403/the-green-choice-9-budget-friendly-ways-for-families-to-embrace-the-organic-diet/,"02:49 PM August 07, 2019"," Many people have been jumping on the organic bandwagon due to the tons of benefits that can be reaped from living an organic lifestyle. For one, organic food does not contain harmful hormones, chemicals, and contaminants that are dangerously present in non-organic food. It is safer, healthier, and more nutritious, too, since an organic diet provides more vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids for the body. It also offers fresher and better tasting products, minus the synthetic flavors that non-organic products contain. Equally important are the significant benefits that organic production provides for the environment, such as the substantial reduction of its exposure to toxic chemicals, resulting in healthy soil, clean water, and increased biodiversity. Organic production also reduces carbon dioxide levels, helps slow climate change, and promotes sustainable living. In spite of all these great benefits, people are still hesitant to take the organic route, believing that it may prove to be financially burdensome for them. So here are some tips on how your family can embrace the organic diet, without breaking the bank! Indeed, it is possible to live organically and frugally. 1. Buy directly from organic farms. By doing so, you don’t just support your local farmers, but you also get the freshest produce at a cheaper price. Going to the farm and having a chat with the farmers and harvesters can also be an enriching experience. 2. Buy fruits and veggies that are in season. They are fresher, cheaper, and more readily available. (Check this out for the list of fruits that are currently in season in the Philippines.) 3. Maintain your own organic garden. Herbs, which can be expensive to buy but take up little room when planted, grow well indoors on a sunny windowsill. 4. Constantly visit the organic section of your local grocery store and supermarket for new products. Also, make a habit of reading the labels. “Natural” and “free-range” are not synonymous to “organic.” 5. Buy only what you need. Remember to avoid wastage resulting from overbuying, poor storage, and mismanagement of your food stock in the pantry, fridge, and freezer. 6. Buy your necessities in bulk, particularly produce with long shelf lives. It will save you money in the long run since you can get great deals when buying in bulk. 7. Opt for home-cooked meals instead of eating out or ordering delivery food. You can also make your own version of processed food products like cereals and baby food. In fact, you can turn almost any recipe into a culinary masterpiece simply by using organic ingredients! 8. Instead of junk foods, offer the kiddos with healthy and nutritious snack options such as fresh juices and sandwiches with homemade spread. 9. Familiarize yourself with what is called in the US as “The Dirty Dozen” (a list of the 12 fruits and vegetables that contain the highest concentrations of pesticides) and “The Clean Fifteen” (a list of the 15 fruits and vegetables that contain the fewest concentrations of pesticides). If you can’t find fresh organic products (there are products that cannot be maintained fresh due to the distance and/or their needs for longer shelf life), make sure that you pick those that are Organic certified. Those products have been rigorously tested and have complied to higher standards of production. Making the shift to organic products In any family, it is our kids who deserve to receive the most nutritional and healthy food available. That’s why many Filipino moms are becoming more cautious with their choices for their little ones, and are now making the shift to organic milk–like Arla. Arla is one of the largest organic dairy producers in the world. Every pack of Arla Organic Powdered Milk undergoes a thorough process of organic production based on four principles – ecology, health, fairness, and care. This is why the cows in Arla farms are raised in free-range conditions, and are fed 100 percent organic food that come from their own pastures!  The end product? Arla Organic Powdered Milk that is made with organic ingredients, with no GMOs and pesticides – making it 100% European certified. Because it has so few ingredients, Arla Organic Powdered Milk tastes natural and fresh. It also dissolves easily, making preparing milk for your family quick and convenient. What’s more, it doesn’t come with a hefty price tag! Being organic is more than just a label or descriptor. There is a lot of patience involved in organic production as there are no shortcuts to truly natural produce. It takes years of painstaking research and hard work, and it entails taking care of the environment, biodiversity, and animal welfare. Conventionally grown foods often have “hidden” costs – the costs of environmental harm and long-term health risks. These “hidden” costs do not show up on the grocery store shopping receipt, but they exist nonetheless.  For more information, visit Arla’s website to discover their other Arla brands or shop at any leading supermarket nationwide for your Arla Organic Powdered Milk today!

Sierra Leone’s secret societies,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/342150/sierra-leones-secret-societies/,"12:33 PM August 04, 2019","Freetown, Sierra Leone | AFP | Sunday 8/4/2019 – 11:37 UTC+8 By: Saidu Bah  Wearing a fading Mickey Mouse T-shirt, her knees hugged to her chest, eight-year-old Musu Kamara sits in a corrugated shack in Sierra Leone’s capital waiting for her initiation into a secret society.  Kamara will leave for two weeks in the bush with a sisterhood called Bondo.  There, she and other girls will learn ritual dances and chants and how to confront spirits as the group is groomed for adulthood and tribal duties. And Kamara will also have to endure female genital mutilation.  For youngsters in Sierra Leone, the end of the school year often means passing through initiation into a Bondo or, for boys, an all-male group called a Poro.  The ceremonies have deep roots and are jealously guarded in many villages, where they are defended as a vital moment in life.  But many of the children who take part in them will be scarred, physically as well as mentally.  Boys, whose retreats can last months, may be sliced on the back with razors to leave the “mark of the teeth” of a spirit that swallows them.  Girls face “cutting”: the removal of their clitoris, a practice found in other parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia — and increasingly reviled.  Secret societies have an entrenched role in tribal and political life in Sierra Leone, as in other parts of West Africa.  Membership confers social status and respect, even opening doors to tribal chief posts and government jobs.  Joe Alie, a professor of African studies at the University of Sierra Leone, said more than 90 percent of the country’s population was involved in ancestral and secret rites.  Bondo and Poro societies “still play a leading role in the social, religious and political life” of communities, he said.  But President Julius Maada Bio’s government faces a delicate balancing act over how to manage these influential organisations and their traditions.  The pain of ritual, especially female genital mutilation — FGM — is increasingly under attack.  Even Bio’s wife, Fatima, was caught up in the debate early this year.  She provoked a huge backlash after publicly declaring she was not against FGM, which practitioners call circumcision.  The first lady later said she had been misunderstood and that she condemned the forcible excision of girls aged under 18.  Yambundu Oile, who has initiated thousands of girls like Kamara, said “cutting” was only part of the initiation.  “It is not only to circumcise them, we also teach them to be a woman, to cook, to respect the elders,” she said.  “After the initiation, they return to their community to continue their education until their marriage.”  The societies are under pressure after a string of kidnappings and even deaths, forcing the government to temporarily ban them.  Now rituals cannot be imposed on minors without their consent, and any discrimination for non-membership of a secret society is prohibited.  But analysts see little impact.  “The challenge is to eliminate female genital mutilation, but not the Bondo culture,” which plays an important role in society, says Rugiatu Turay, a former minister who supports a ban on FGM.  “We have more Bondo sites than schools in Sierra Leone…But it’s hard to convince people to reform their practices because politicians fund circumcision ceremonies to win votes.”  Despite this, the outcry against FGM is leading to change.  “I want none of my daughters to undergo genital mutilation, which leaves a mark for life,” says Mabinty Bangura, who endured FGM 20 years ago — a ceremony whose pain, she said, “never seemed to end.”  “One woman covers your mouth, another is holding you by the chest and two others by the legs,” she said.  “Then they spread your legs, remove the whole clitoris and apply a tissue impregnated with medicinal herbs.”   In the northern regions of Tonkolili and Port Loko, a new type of ritual is emerging in which girls are initiated by the Sowei — the head of a female secret society — but are not “cut.”  It is the initiative of a Swiss aid worker, Michele Moreau, who in 2010 became the first European to join a Bondo, taking the name of Shema Roko.  “Twenty-five Soweis have vowed before leaders to stop the circumcisions. They replaced their red scarves with yellow ones, creating the ‘Yellow Bondo’,” said Moreau, whose association supports the schooling and health of young girls.  Since then, around 700 girls have been initiated in Tonkolili without undergoing FGM.  Some applaud the initiative as a way of enrolling secret societies into the fight to stamp out mutilation.  Others, though, oppose it as disrespectful.  “I hope that circumcision continues, but with the consent of the girls,” said Sento Kamara, a Bondo member. “It is part of our culture and our tradition.”  sb-siu/sst/ri © Agence France-Presse  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
Teaching kids the benefits of eating meat-free meals,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/340430/teaching-kids-the-benefits-of-eating-meat-free-meals/,"07:34 PM July 14, 2019","MANILA, Philippines — Some 100 kids learned about the health benefits, environmental impact and the ethics of eating vegetables and eating meat-free meals from guest readers nutritionist-dietitian Ann Abacan and actress and TV host Patricia Tumulak at the Inquirer Read-Along session at the Philippine Daily Inquirer office in Makati on Saturday. Tumulak read “Ang Ampalaya sa Pinggan ni Peepo” (“The Bitter Gourd on Peepo’s Plate”), which was written by Joachim Antonio and illustrated by Pergylene Acuña. The story tells of a young boy who refuses to eat ampalaya and how he learned to eat the vegetable for its nutritional value. A former beauty queen, Tumulak has tried to practice a healthy lifestyle by going on a yearly detox, going on a vegan diet for three days. She also did juicing, using fresh fruits and vegetables. “Growing up, I was used to eating whatever I want. When I was introduced to healthy food, I felt lighter and rejuvenated. That’s why it’s important for kids to learn to eat vegetables and fruits at an early age so they would get used to their unique flavors like bitterness,” Tumulak said. Long-time Inquirer Read-Along partner Abacan read “Paano Kumain ng Kulay?”, which was written by Mabi David and illustrated by Yas Doctor. The poem introduces kids to vegetables and fruits by color association. Each rainbow color is assigned a specific vegetable or fruit, whose flavors are also identified. Abacan, the principal of Sophia School in Meycauayan in Bulacan, is an advocate of going meatless and keeping a healthy plant-based diet. In 2011, Sophia School started its “Meatless Monday,” which is patterned after a global movement that started in New York in 2003. Mondays in the canteen of Sophia School means having meat-free meals, serving only vegetables, vegemeat and other plant-based sources for the students, faculty, and staff. Meals include veggie menudo, congee with tofu, boiled root crops, and other meat substitutes, such as mycoprotein, which is made from mushrooms. Mycoprotein is found in products of Quorn, a leading meat replacement food manufacturer based in the United Kingdom. Saturday’s read-along session, which hosted by Inquirer Lifestyle writing editor Ruth Navarra-Mayo, was held in cooperation with Quorn, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), Meatless Monday Philippines team and TessDrive.com. —With reports from Andrea Gregorio and Zathea dela Peña, Inquirer Interns /atm  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
#UHAWAreYou?: Your kids may not be getting the proper hydration they need every day,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/334658/uhawareyou-your-kids-may-not-be-getting-the-proper-hydration-they-need-every-day/,"04:02 PM May 20, 2019","Hydration is extremely important for the proper functioning of all organs of the body as water serves as the body’s solvent, reactant, lubricant, temperature regulator, and provider of dietary minerals. Thus, constant replenishment of the fluids lost through the kidneys, skin, lungs and bowels, is necessary. When the amount of water ingested is not enough to balance the amount of water that the body requires for proper functioning, the body is said to be in a state of dehydration. Young children are more prone to dehydration than adults. In fact, according to a study on hydration by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology (FNRI-DOST), 8 out of 10  Filipino school children are not getting enough fluids to keep them hydrated and healthy.  During periods of play, sports and physical exercise, children may not immediately feel the sensation of thirst (which is the first symptom of dehydration), and thus fail to drink water or beverages to replace the body fluids lost. They also tend to postpone drinking even when they feel thirsty because of lack of time and opportunity to get a drink as they are so engrossed in their kiddie activities. For younger children, they cannot or do not know how to articulate their need to drink while, for others, lack of access to a thirst quencher is often the case. Depending on its severity, dehydration can have serious adverse effects on young children. It brings about the usual symptoms such as dry lips and mouth, cold and dry skin, sunken eyes, highly colored urine and less frequent urination, tiredness, headache, and dizziness. When dehydration becomes long-term, physical and mental performance suffers, thus may limit children’s academic and physical development, including their social interaction with other children and adults. Some studies have shown that even mild dehydration in children affects mood and cognition. Children who are more dehydrated may have poorer memories.  Contrary to popular belief that everyone needs at least 8 glasses of water a day to keep hydrated, individual fluid requirements vary depending on factors such as age, sex, level of physical activity, extent of exposure to extreme heat, and medical conditions such as diarrhea and other diseases that lead to loss of body fluids. It is estimated that, under ordinary circumstances, school age children should take a least 5-7 glasses of water and other fluids a day, in addition to the water that they get from food.  For teenage boys, at least 9-10 glasses would ordinarily be enough, and for girls, at least 7-8 glasses would suffice. In cases of heavy physical exertion and exposure to extreme heat, however, their fluid requirement is greatly increased. In the Philippines, heat index (or the level of heat felt by the human body based on air temperature and humidity) during the driest season can soar to as high as 51.7°C, just like what Dagupan City in Pangasinan experienced a few weeks ago. Adults, particularly mothers and other care-givers, should take measures to make sure that their children and wards are properly hydrated. Here are some of the habits that they should adopt: #UHAWAreYou? is a campaign that has been launched to help increase the awareness about the hydration situation in the Philippines. #UHAWAreYou encourages parents to check on their kids’ state of hydration and take measures to make sure their child intakes the right amount of fluids possible through various ways. All beverages and food with water can help us hydrate, and in times when children want to drink something more interesting than water, parents can offer them drinks that will make hydration more satisfying and still ensure that they are well-hydrated every day.  To avoid uhaw, always check on when was the last time you had your kids drink.

Vital Dome machine basking in the far infrared experience,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/332947/vital-dome-machine-basking-in-the-far-infrared-experience/,"12:44 PM April 25, 2019","Vital Dome, founded and manufactured in France by Alexandra Gavsevitch and Eric Fauchon, is an advanced infra-therapy ecosystem machine that uses pure far infrared to regenerate the body from within and without, is now available in the Philippines through i3 Incorporated. Mr. Fauchon and Mrs. Gavsevitch—both internationally known in the Naturopathy, and Health and Wellness industry—realize that skin body toxins are the real cause of health concerns so they looked into a  more effective and natural detoxification process. With Vital Dome, more people can benefit from the most advanced and most natural beauty and wellness maintenance machine that uses Far Infrared (a vital radiation of the sun), which is the ultimate, most natural, and essential factor for body rejuvenating and healing. The single, most outstanding quality of Vital Dome is its black carbon heating panels which emit high density and uniform distribution of carbon in the panels, allowing for an even emission of temperature on its surface for maximum efficiency and comfort. What makes it superior and more advanced its “Far infrared” system, a biocompatible emission that penetrates up to 4cm beneath the skin. This means that it can improve tissue exchange, enhance draining function, stimulate blood circulation and cleanse the body of harmful toxins. But while it is aggressive about eradicating unwanted body contaminants, the technology guarantees a gentle and efficient method in rejuvenating all bodily processes. One Vital Dome session lasts up to 40 minutes and each session has 36 treatment programs that are personalized and tailored to an individual’s specific needs. “There is no risk of claustrophobia during treatments because you will be free to stretch or move a little and the heat envelops the entire body through its four-heated zones focusing on the back, chest, legs, and feet, making it very safe,” assured Katherine Alejar, i3 CEO and Chief Innovator, and Vital Dome’s exclusive distributor in the Philippines. Understanding Vital Dome’s Far Infrared Using Far Infrared in a machine is the fruit of long years of extensive research headlined by Fauchon and Gavsevitch. They found out that at the normal body temperature, infrared radiation emits the ideal energy to give more vigor to the cells and optimize the body processes of growth and development. And because Far Infrared is easily absorbed by humans, it raises the internal temperature of the body, a heat transfer by radiation emitted by the “B-Carbon” panels, an essential part of the Vital Dome®. The radiations from the state-of-the-art carbon panels penetrate deep into the body without excessively increasing the ambient temperature.  Clinical studies prove that 82% of those who experienced Vital Dome’s Infratherapy feel more relaxed while 77% achieved a slimmer silhouette. Almost 70% noticed how their skin got firmer and almost 80% proved they attained lighter legs, improved sleeping pattern and enhanced overall well-being. “After 12 sessions in just over a month using the Vital Dome machine, some clients experienced up to 4cm reduction in their waistline and up to 2.5cm in the hips. Some reported about a drop of up to 2cm around their thighs,” Alejar shared. Aside from weight loss, the more essential results from the Vital Dome experience is an ultimate detoxification, oxygenation of tissues, reduction of edema, and skin stimulation. The skin becomes firm, is purified and revitalized. Damaged tissues due to stress are regenerated; wrinkles are reduced. And those with dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis are relieved.  It also helps to stimulate the immune system, reduce physical and muscular pain, lowers blood pressure and relieves rheumatism and joint pain. Who can benefit from Vital Dome’s Far Infrared Technology “Anyone who moves, those who have heavy workload and responsibilities, those who want to look and feel good and lose weight,  and those who want to boost their health and well-being could use some sessions in the Vital Dome. So, that’s practically everyone,” Alejar said.

An Open Letter to GlutaMAX from a Morena,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/331919/an-open-letter-to-glutamax-from-a-morena/,"02:30 PM April 16, 2019","Dear Healthwell Nutraceuticals and GlutaMAX, It took me a long time to write this letter. I even thought about not writing anything at all. This is not the first time I’ve encountered a whitening product campaign that tells me that there is something wrong with my morena skin. Why should I acknowledge this one? Why should I defend myself when there is nothing wrong with my skin tone in the first place? You should be the defensive one. Defend your ignorant advertising and marketing strategy. Defend how a group of people pitched this idea, approved it, and went all over social media and billboards, thinking this was perfectly fine. Not once in your entire process, was this questioned? And if it was, what made your executives decide to still go with it? In a time that we’ve seen how perverted our beauty standards have been due to various factors like white privilege, anti-feminism, sexism, classism, and colorism, you should defend yourselves. Defend yourselves for making it seem like we begrudge people with fair skin for getting hired and getting ahead in life just because of their skin color. I’ve never perceived anyone better than me or beneath me because they have a different skin color than I do. It’s just a fact of life that people are colored differently. The fact that you portray morenas with this mentality further supports the idea that those with darker skin are the villains in the story. This campaign undertones that the only reason fair-skinned Filipinas get to where they’re at is due to their looks. How blithely insulting. Honestly, how could you think this campaign would work when you’re basically throwing shade at everyone: morena and mestiza? Pun fully intended. Defend how you forwarded toxic ideals for the sake of selling your product and making money. There is nothing wrong with glutathione. As a beauty writer and lifestyle editor, I’ve written about several products that contain glutathione and how it’s a naturally-occurring chemical in the body. What’s not natural is how we make people feel bad about something as normal as their skin color. What’s not natural is that you dare hurt generations of young people and their self-esteem to earn sales. As a child and as a teenager, I’ve cried many times over my skin color. How ridiculous! Campaigns from companies like you have bombarded me with the idea that being white is the only way to be beautiful. In this country’s great paradox, I grew up constantly being told that I should change how I look when how I look is inherent to these tropical islands. Or at least one of the inherent ways a Filipina looks. We are, after all, a melting pot of various races and cultures. When you even cited a dubious survey fact in your campaign, it was ironic. You paraded around exactly what was wrong with our culture. And then you basically said to propagate it. Our colonial past has left us with wounds that are still open up to now. We are still not over the perception our colonizers imposed on us: that their fairer skin is superior, connoting higher levels of wealth and education. When in fact, there’s no such thing as a superior skin color. Skin color shouldn’t be the basis of one’s worth. Look it up, GlutaMAX. In the most extreme sense, putting privilege based solely on appearance is called racism. Yet, we still have to take these notions down and write these letters because companies like you continue to make money off it, among many other reasons. In high school, I was told point-blank by a classmate that I would be prettier if only I were white. In college, I once spent a night over at a friend’s place. She happened to be a chinita. The morning after, I hugged her good-bye right before getting into a cab with my big overnight bag. Without missing a beat, the driver asked me if I was that household’s help, leaving for my day off. In those few seconds, he jumped to a narrative that’s disrespectful to all parties involved. Why does skin color connote hierarchy? Why do we perceive certain jobs as beneath people who look a certain way? There’s nothing wrong with working as household help. There’s everything wrong with how we assume that the only way two people of different skin types can interact is by one being “inferior” to the other. I was best friends with a beautiful girl in college who also had very fair skin. I always heard the condescending “You’re beautiful too, Olivia” line too many times whenever we were out. News flash: I know I’m beautiful. But these people have seen the ads and heard the conversations. And they probably assumed that these messages got to me. They probably think that I do believe in their hurtful comments. They know there’s a problem with the way people look at my skin. And in comforting me for something I’m not sorry about, they believe in what they say to an extent and feel guilty about it. I’ve also heard so many times the “You should be grateful for your skin color because people abroad spend so much on tanning products to have your color” line. Thank you. I never thought of being NOT grateful for my skin. Unless I go full Michael Jackson, this is my skin. Why is it that I’ve been comforted and confronted for it? It’s skin. It’s what I was born with. I repeat: There’s nothing wrong with the skin, whatever color it may be. Thank you, GlutaMAX, for telling me that all these experiences could have been avoided had I only been lighter, had I only subscribed to your product. Thanks for pointing out how unfair it is that I’m maltreated just because of the melanin in my skin. Melanin. Something we all have. Something that everyone has in varying amounts, just like gluta. Instead of challenging how society looks at me, I should have done everything I could to be fairer. So my life could be better. How could I be so dumb? Thank you, GlutaMAX, for telling me to join them because I can’t beat them. Since this country has such a deep-seated problem against skin color, I should detest my pigment. Your initial official statement after the backlash you’ve received was a poor one. In danger of losing sales, you’re hiding behind the guise of defending the freedom of choice and empowering people. It took you another full day to take down your ads on social media. How’s that for sincere? Your official apology is still missing the mark. You acknowledged that there’s something wrong with how we perceive skin color, but you’ll continue to prey on this insecurity. It’s clearly damage control given all the negative comments. Maybe you couldn’t handle the Facebook notifications you got per minute. You’re not empowering women when you’re telling them that the only way they will be happy is to change their skin color. Because, according to you, the lighter one is and always will be better. You’re not encouraging self-love if you’re telling women (and men) that they must change themselves completely to meet society’s demands. You’re not supporting people for the choices they make. You’re deceiving people into thinking that they’re making the right choice by subscribing to a backward ideal instead of seeing how what we are born with is beautiful on its own. I hope you’re happy that all this publicity has made you a headline and a trending topic. I hope this company and all the people behind this campaign can sleep well at night knowing they made bank at this expense.

Steady State: Is It The Superior Form Of Cardio,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/331523/steady-state-is-it-the-superior-form-of-cardio/,"05:17 PM April 11, 2019","When people say they’re doing cardio, they often refer to jogging or running. Your heart is throbbing; you’re gasping for your breath; and you’re drenched in sweat. These experiences are what we often associate with cardio. What if I told you that simple, medium-pace walking is also considered cardio? It’s not just cardio, but it’s a highly-effective form of exercise that helps trim that waist and keep you leaner long-term. Let’s get scientific for a hot minute. There are two types of cardiovascular exercise—aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic exercise is performed at a low enough intensity that oxygen is sufficient to energize your muscles. Anaerobic exercise, however, is performed at a higher intensity which requires glycogen stores or sugar to fire up your muscles, since oxygen takes some time to get distributed throughout your body. Steady state or LISS (low-intensity steady state cardio) is an aerobic exercise which means the repetition of the same movement for long periods of time while maintaining a stable, moderate heart rate, typically around 40-60% of your max heart rate. For most people, that’s about 120 to125 BPM heart rate. Examples of LISS are walking, cycling, and swimming. Since all are somewhat light to medium intensity, you can do this for prolonged periods of time, starting at 20 minutes and increasing to 45 to 60 minutes per session, and even more eventually. I recommend you do this in first thing in the morning, not having eaten anything, so you burn purely fat. You may have heard of steady state’s more popular and vigorous, counterpart—HIIT or high intensity interval training. This is typically short bursts performed at 90% of your maximum heart rate, followed by short breaks to recover. Sports like basketball, and workouts like circuit training and Tabata are considered HITT. Because of its intensity, it’s recommended not to do more than 20 to 30 minutes at a time. There’s a reason why intense exercise is so popular—you burn fat in a shorter time; it’s challenging, hence, it’s never boring! With that said, there are number of advantages LISS has over HIIT, and here are my top ones: Beginner friendly – If you are able to walk, ride a bike, or swim, you’re able to steady state—easy as that! This helps build endurance, but doesn’t require much of it to get started. Faster recovery – Steady state cardio is easier to do, hence it’s not too taxing on the body. That’s a good thing because it requires little to no recovery time in between sessions. And if you do HITT and you are sore after a few intense workouts, doing some LISS can help speed up recovery in between those as well and lessen the lactic acid build up. Builds endurance and grit – LISS is great for developing your aerobic fitness level and increasing your cardiovascular endurance. It essentially makes your heart stronger and better equipped to do its job through long bouts of physical activity. Whether you’re a normal Joe or an athlete, steady state cardio teaches how to endure, both mentally and physically, any type or length of the workout. Promotes consistency – Since it is not as demanding as HITT, the ability to stick to it is quite high. It’s still exercise and you’re giving your body the physical activity it needs, but since it requires little effort to start, and little recovery in between, there’s less excuses not to keep it going! It depends. Both HIIT and LISS are incredibly effective forms of exercise, so choosing what is the more superior form of cardio, depends on your individual goals. I’ve been running races and marathons for about six years now, and I’ve always considered myself a runner. I love running—the thrill of races, the openness of the community, and the ability to eat carbs! And I have an even more profound love for group HIIT classes which I do with friends. As I mentioned before, HITT runs off of glycogen and sugar, so it gives you a little (just a little!) more leeway in having carbohydrates in your diet. With that said, I have recently fallen in love with steady state cardio. I’ve been doing it almost every morning for the past eight months—it’s my morning workout/meditation, so it starts my day off right. Also, it’s helped me get in the best shape of my life. In just the eight months, I’ve gone from 29.9% body fat to 19.1%. Of course, that is coupled with a healthy diet and resistance training, but I am able to consistently eat clean and lift weights because I’m not running so much. Running for me is invigorating, but also tiring, and makes me crave and eat more unhealthy carbs than I would like. I still do HIIT here and there for the social aspect, but one thing is consistent—I’ll walk every morning. That works for me, and I believe that will work for me even ten years from now. Now, find what works for you. I recommend you give steady state a try for at least two weeks and see if that’s what’s superior for you. How to have a bikini-ready body—always!

Are our genes the only factor affecting our child’s potential adult height?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/330462/are-our-genes-the-only-factor-affecting-our-childs-potential-adult-height/,"06:51 PM April 03, 2019","Study reveals that children with proper nutrition are more likely to reach their full growth potential Parents always want the best for their children and ensuring their growth and development is no exception. For this reason, parents like to know if their children are growing at the right height and want to make sure that they are eating the best foods to stay active and healthy as they grow. The first five years is a critical window in a child’s life for growth, with 60 percent of the child’s adult height achieved during this stage. This period is also the time when a child is most likely to encounter barriers to growth such as poor nutrition, feeding difficulties or frequent illnesses. However, in terms of growth, Filipinos grow up with many beliefs about how to achieve the height that they want.  For example, jumping as soon as the clock strikes midnight during New Year’s Eve, or not stepping over a child because it will delay their growth are just some of the common superstitions, and almost everyone has participated in these practices in the hopes of growing even an inch taller. Children falling behind with their height is a common concern and problem among Filipinos. According to a study released by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI), 1 out of 3 Filipino children is stunted. However, parents will often shrug it off believing that Filipinos are genetically shorter, and it is just normal for their children will be short too. Being undernourished is not often thought of as a potential reason for growth issues, but a nutrition company is now saying otherwise. Providing an oral nutritional supplement like PediaSure Plus can help provide the proper nutrition a child needs by helping fill nutritional gaps and helping them reach their full growth potential. PediaSure Plus has 37 vital growth nutrients and a triple protein complex clinically proven to support muscle and bone growth. A clinical study among Filipino children showed that drinking two servings of PediaSure Plus with three balanced meals each day resulted in visible growth within eight weeks of continued use, helping to improve appetite, weight, and height, reducing sick days and sustaining proportional growth. Dr. Jose Rodolfo Dimaano Jr. – medical director at Abbott explains: “To support their overall growth and development, children require complete and balanced nutrition. PediaSure Plus provides essential macronutrients and micronutrients needed by a child to stay healthy and well-nourished. Its consistent use helps children who face nutritional gaps due to poor eating habits or frequent illnesses to meet their dietary requirements of key nutrients for growth. This is especially important if your child is not getting adequate nutrients such as calcium, iron, vitamin A and C – all needed to support the optimal growth of children.”  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
How to have a bikini-ready body—always!,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/329708/how-to-have-a-bikini-ready-body-always/,"08:59 PM March 28, 2019","Summer is a time for enjoyment—escaping to a white sand beach; devouring halo-halo; making out-of-town Holy Week plans; and essentially rewarding the hard work you’ve put in all year, with treats in all various forms. Why not? You deserve it, right? When it comes to saving up cash and vacation days to take the much-needed time to relax and reenergize—I’m all for it. However, when you diet and train hard for that awesome body you plan to flaunt in a cute bikini, and you intend to reward yourself by indulging in decadent dishes and skipping those daily gym sessions—please don’t. That’s not a reward. Having a beautiful, healthy body IS the reward. I urge to you keep up the good work, and I promise you can stay fit, and still enjoy these festive, summer months to the fullest. Here are a few of my tips to make sure that is the case. While on vacation, the one thing I try to do no matter where I am in the world is to start my day with a walk. It’s a habit I’ve developed—I wake up, drink black coffee, and either jump on the treadmill or walk outside for 30 minutes to an hour. I do this to wake up my metabolism first thing. I still, of course, aim to lift weights three times a week, but no matter how my day goes; I’m rest assured that I got some active minutes in the day. Falling asleep on a sandy beach sounds amazing—but why not swim, kayak or jog first, then fall sleep on the beach? If you’re heading out of town, it might be extra difficult to hit the gym for your typical workout routine and stay active, but there are various ways to keep moving without the gym. If you’re near the water, engage in water activities like paddle boarding, kayaking, diving and just simple swimming. If you’re not by the shore, but still outside the city, go on a trail and hike, or power walk while sightseeing. If you’re staying in the city and would like to escape the heat, hit the mall and make sure to brisk walk, and walk up and down the escalator. When in doubt, just walk, walk, and walk some more! I find that eating well is often times more challenging than staying active. Personally, saying no to ice cream can just about bring me to tears! As a nation that loves complex carbs, such as pasta, rice, and bread, and sugary goodies, like kakanin and cake, one can encounter plenty of bad diet choices when you’re on break. When I’m not strictly counting my calories and macros, and can’t prepare my own food, I follow these simple guidelines to make sure I don’t backslide too much: I like to eat my calories rather than drink it. Most drinks other than water are often laden with sugar and even carbs, with little to no nutritional value. I stick to black coffee in the morning and good ole refreshing water throughout the day. If I really am craving for some more flavor, I’ll drink infused water, unsweetened tea, and sometimes diet or stevia soda. I wasn’t a fan of carbonated drinks, but diet soda has become my last resort when I can’t deny the sweet craving. Avoiding these empty calories, allow me to eat substantial ones in the form of whole foods that will provide my body the nutrients it needs. This philosophy stays true when drinking alcohol. I personally only have a few drinks in a year, but when I do, I steer clear of the sugary cocktails and mixers, and stick to vodka or gin with a splash of soda, and a slice of lime—minimal calories, same alcoholic punch! Lean protein and leafy vegetables, that is. Speaking of nutrients, I try my best to choose grilled chicken or fish as my protein, with a side of vegetables as my carbs to round out my meals. Protein is an important building block for your muscles; and muscles are what keeps your metabolism churning; hence keeping your body burning fat. Do you need any more reason to eat protein than that? Also, I try to choose vegetables with every meal in place of complex carbs. Did you know that vegetables are also classified as carbohydrates? With this in mind, eating rice and bread because “you need the energy” is not a valid reason, unless you’re currently heavily training. Much better to eat vegetables—the dark green and leafy kind. Not only will you get the fiber you need and more nutrients than you would have gotten from starchy carbs, but you’ll avoid the energy crash and bloating. I highly discourage snacking. It is often a mindless, nasty habit that leads to unnecessary calories. A bag of chips here, a handful of peanuts there, and a stack of crackers later, and you can easily eat a meal or two worth of calories without much protein, but with plenty of sodium, carbs, and sugar. The worst part is, you often intend to only eat a few pieces of chips or nuts, and then you realize you’ve eaten the entire bag. You know what I mean! With this in mind, sometimes it’s very difficult to avoid snacking when summer travel and social events come into play. When I’m out and about, I always keep a small bag of raw almonds or a protein cookie in my purse. Whether I’m stuck in traffic or on the beach with friends, and hunger or cravings hit me in between meals, I take a bite of either one. Raw almonds (not salted, roasted, sugared or fried!) are rich in good fats and protein. Also, be careful with which protein cookies you choose. I pick the ones that have the lowest sugar content and the highest grams of protein so it’s more satisfying. If you can, make your own! I also make sure to drink plenty of water. Sometimes the craving is simply my body telling me that I need hydration in this hot, humid weather. You’d be surprised how many hunger pangs and cravings I’ve curbed when I simply drank water. The tips I mentioned above are all physical, but there’s something to be said about the mental aspect of maintaining a healthy and strong bikini body. A bikini is essentially just a piece of clothing (a very small one too!). It’s our bodies that give it it’s sexiness. No matter how you got to this point—smart, healthy long-term choices or crash dieting and over training, I strongly encourage you to admire the body you have and want to treat it well. For me, wellness as a primarily goal over aesthetics, has made me healthier, stronger, and happier—not to mention also leaner! Incorporate healthy eating habits and exercise often because of self-love. Yes, looking good is an awesome motivator, but what happens when you get your body in the shape you want? You’re more likely to stick to this healthy lifestyle for the long haul, if your goals are also long term. And, that fit bikini body will not only come, but will be here to stay.

Fathers-to-be who smoke could be increasing their child’s risk of a congenital heart defect,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/329342/fathers-to-be-who-smoke-could-be-increasing-their-childs-risk-of-a-congenital-heart-defect/,"05:46 PM March 26, 2019","New Chinese research has found that fathers-to-be who smoke may be increasing their child’s risk of congenital heart defects. Carried out by researchers at Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, the new meta-analysis looked at 125 studies carried out before June 2018, which included a total of 137,574 babies with congenital heart defects and 8.8 million prospective parents. The researchers used the data to investigate the effect of maternal smoking, paternal smoking and passive smoking on the risk of congenital heart defects, which are the leading cause of stillbirth and affect eight in 1,000 babies born worldwide. The findings, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, showed that all types of smoking increased the risk of congenital heart defects. Fathers-to-be to who smoked appeared to increase the risk by 74 percent, and mothers-to-be who smoked by 25 percent, compared to parents who did not smoke. Children born to mothers who were exposed to passive smoking had a 124 percent higher risk of congenital heart defects. Exposure to secondhand smoke also appeared to increase the risk during all stages of pregnancy, even before women became pregnant. However, although maternal smoking during pregnancy also increased the risk of having a child with a congenital heart defect, smoking before pregnancy did not appear to affect risk. “Smoking is teratogenic, meaning it can cause developmental malformations. The association between prospective parents smoking and the risk of congenital heart defects has attracted more and more attention with the increasing number of smokers of childbearing age,” said study author Dr. Jiabi Qin. The researchers note that this was the first meta-analysis to investigate how paternal smoking and maternal passive smoking could affect a child’s risk of congenital heart defects, with previous studies focusing only on a mother’s smoking habits. However, Dr. Qin points out, “In fact, smoking in fathers-to-be and exposure to passive smoking in pregnant women are more common than smoking in pregnant women.” “Fathers-to-be should quit smoking,” he added. “Fathers are a large source of secondhand smoke for pregnant women, which appears to be even more harmful to unborn children than women smoking themselves.” He also advises that, “Women should stop smoking before trying to become pregnant to ensure they are smoke-free when they conceive. Staying away from people who are smoking is also important. Employers can help by ensuring that workplaces are smokefree.” CE/JB RELATED STORIES: Smoking during pregnancy linked with increased risk of sudden infant death Heavy smoking could damage your vision, says new study  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019

Carried out by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis, along with the University of California and the University of Vermont, the new study looked at 4,191 children aged 9 to 11 years old across the U.S. The children’s parents were asked to report on their child’s participation in 23 different sports and activities and any depressive symptoms. The children also underwent brain scans to record their hippocampal volume. The findings, published in the journal Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging, showed that playing sports was associated with a larger hippocampal volume in both girls and boys, and also fewer symptoms of depression in boys. The associations were even stronger for children participating in sports that were more structured, such as team sports or regular lessons. The researchers suggested that the different effect of sports on depression among girls could mean that different factors contribute to depression in girls, or that a stronger association between sports and depression might emerge at a later developmental period for girls. Previous research has already found that depression in adults is associated with shrinkage of the hippocampus, a region of the brain important in memory and response to stress, with some studies suggesting that exercise can also have a positive effect on depression and hippocampal volume in adults. However, the new study is one of the first to suggest that participating in team sports may have a similar positive effect on children. “Our findings are important because they help illuminate the relationships between involvement in sports, volume of a particular brain region and depressive symptoms in kids as young as nine,” said lead author Lisa Gorham. “We found that involvement in sports, but not non-sport activities such as music or art, is related to greater hippocampal volume in both boys and girls, and is related to reduced depression in boys,” she added. “The fact that these relationships were strongest for team or structured sports suggests that there might be something about the combination of exercise and the social support or structure that comes from being on a team that can be useful at preventing or treating depression in young people,” Gorham said. “The findings raise intriguing possibilities for new work on preventing and treating depression in children.” CE/JB RELATED STORIES: Healthy diet linked to reduced symptoms of depression Social media linked to higher risk of depression in teen girls   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019

Led by researchers at the University of Georgia, the new study looked at data on 7,893 Chinese women age 45 and over taken from the Chinese Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, which included information about biological, demographic and lifestyle factors that may contribute to high blood pressure. The findings, published in the journal Hypertension Research, showed that the age of menarche, which is a female’s first period, was linked with the risk of high blood pressure. More specifically, an early onset of menarche by one year was found to significantly increase the risk of hypertension later in adulthood, by 6 percent, even after the researchers had taken into account other potentially influencing factors including age, education, marital status, body mass index (BMI), smoking, drinking and medication However, there was no significant relationship between age of menopause and blood pressure after adjusting the findings for these other lifestyle factors. Previous studies in the area have so far provided inconsistent results, with study author Luqi Shen explaining that “[s]ome studies suggested that early menarche increased the risk of hypertension in late adulthood, while other studies indicated that late onset of menarche was associated with hypertension in late adulthood.” Shen went on to suggest that the rate our body develops earlier in life could influence longer term health; when one system develops early or too late then this can also affect other systems in the body. “Women with early menarche may have less than optimal developed cardiovascular system, therefore, had higher risk for adverse outcomes, such as hypertension in late adulthood,” said Shen. “So, the association of early menarche with hypertension is as expected in this population.” However, the effect can be modified by environmental factors, for example, a healthy lifestyle. “Interestingly, this association is entirely explained by body mass index,” said Shen. “This suggests that body weight management around menopausal stage is critical in blood pressure management for women at menopausal age, and we believe this finding is not specific to Chinese women and may be applicable to women in all countries.” JB RELATED STORIES: Resistance training three times a week linked to lower risk of type 2 diabetes E-cigarette use linked to heart trouble — study   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
Nutrition Month 2019: Comparing claims of 4 dietary trends,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/326196/p2fb-nutrition-month-2019-comparing-the-claims-of-4-dietary-trends/,"07:11 PM March 03, 2019","March marks National Nutrition Month in the United States, sponsored by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, to help both adults and children set healthy eating habits, to achieve optimal nutrition and health. In contrast to recent years, no theme has been set for 2019; instead, National Nutrition Month will be honored as its own theme to give people the flexibility to discover more about health and nutrition in their own way. With this in mind, we’ve rounded up some of the diet trends that are currently generating buzz and their health claims. The save the world diet Those who are concerned about the environment as well as their own health may be interested in the “save the world diet,” created by a team of experts as a sustainable eating plan to feel a global population of 10 billion, which the earth is expected to reach by 2050, while also helping to control climate change and prevent millions of premature deaths each year from eating an unhealthy diet. Omnivores will be relieved to know that meat is not off the menu, although if you embark on the diet you will be expected to cut down to just 14 grams of red meat a day and 29 grams of chicken, or have 28 grams per day of fish, with the emphasis instead on beans, pulses, and legumes, fruit and vegetables, and carbs, along with 50 grams a day of nuts, dairy equivalent to one glass of milk a day, and around one egg a week. Insects This isn’t a diet as such, but many experts have suggested recently that adding insects into our diet could be a more sustainable source of protein, helping to replace meat, as well as being a good source of vitamins, minerals and fats. A small U.S. study found that eating a breakfast of muffins or shakes made with cricket flour could increase a metabolic enzyme associated with gut health, and decrease an inflammatory protein linked to depression and cancer. However, a recent study also found that only 26 percent of Britons surveyed in the study reported they would consume edible insects, despite researchers noting that insects are also good for the environment, requiring less land and emitting 99 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than livestock such as cows. The Mediterranean diet If you’re feeling less brave but still want to boost your health, then opt for the traditional Mediterranean Diet. Although it’s been around for years, due to being the staple diet of many living in Greece, Southern Italy and Spain, the diet shows no signs of slowing down in popularity as one of the healthiest to follow. Recent studies have linked the diet, which is rich in fish, fruits, nuts, vegetables, beans, and olive oil and lower in meat, dairy, and processed foods, to a lower risk of stroke, a longer life, and a lower risk of the eye disease age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in the United States. Vegan diet As concerns about the environment, climate change and animal welfare grow, so does the number of people giving up not only meat but all animal-based products, making the vegan diet one of the most popular at the moment. But although it’s better for animals, how healthy is it for humans? There is a growing body of evidence which suggests that going plant-based at least can have a positive effect on health, helping to control type 2 diabetes, and lower the risk of obesity and cancer, and lower cholesterol, while a recent study also showed that a vegan diet could be more effective at boosting beneficial gut hormones, regulating blood sugar, feelings of fullness and weight than a diet that includes meat and cheese. However, cutting animal products out all together can in some cases lead to deficiencies of certain vitamins and minerals, such as omegas -3 and -6, zinc, and iron, so make sure you are getting all you need from other sources.

"Keeping mind, body active in middle age could lower risk of dementia",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/325611/p2fb-keeping-mind-body-active-in-middle-age-could-lower-risk-of-dementia/,"08:46 PM February 25, 2019","New European research has found that keeping active both physically and mentally in middle age could help to lower the risk of dementia later in life. Carried out by researchers at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, the new study looked at 800 Swedish women age 38 to 54 who were followed for 44 years. The researchers recorded the women’s physical and mental activities at the beginning of the study, with mental activities including a diverse range of hobbies such as reading, playing instruments, singing in a choir, visiting concerts, gardening, doing needlework or attending religious services, and gave the women scores based on how often they partook in the activities to indicate whether their level of physical or mental activity was high or low. The findings, published online in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, showed that women who engaged in a high level of mental activities were 46 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and 34 percent less likely to develop dementia overall than the women with the low level of mental activities. Being physically active was also associated with a 52 percent reduced risk of developing dementia with cerebrovascular disease and a 56 percent lower risk of developing mixed dementia, which is when more than one type of dementia is present, compared to the women who were inactive. After taking into account other dementia risk factors, such as high blood pressure, smoking and diabetes, and excluding women who may have been in the prodromal stage of dementia at the beginning of the study, when symptoms are present but not severe, the results were still similar. The only change found was that physical activity was then associated with a 34 percent reduced risk of dementia overall. “These results indicate that these activities in middle age may play a role in preventing dementia in old age and preserving cognitive health,” commented study author Jenna Najar, MD. “It’s exciting as these are activities that people can incorporate into their lives pretty easily and without a lot of expense.” JB  RELATED STORIES: Diet drinks could increase risk of stroke for post-menopausal women Eating nuts linked to improved heart health for those with diabetes   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
"Heavy smoking could damage your vision, says new study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/324802/p2fb-heavy-smoking-could-damage-your-vision-finds-new-study/,"10:58 PM February 18, 2019","New research has found that smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day could damage your vision and color perception. Carried out by researchers at Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care, United States, and the Perception, Neuroscience and Behavior Laboratory, Brazil, the new small-scale study looked at 71 participants who had smoked less than 15 cigarettes ever in their life time and 63 who smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day. The participants were between the ages of 25 and 45 and all classed as healthy with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. However, they had been diagnosed with tobacco addiction and reported that they had made no attempts to stop smoking. During the study, the participants were asked to sit 59 inches away from a 19-inch cathode-ray tube monitor which displayed stimuli. The researchers monitored both of the participants’ eyes simultaneously to assess how well they discriminated between contrast levels (subtle differences in shading) and colors while watching the stimuli. The findings, published in journal Psychiatry Research, showed that the group of heavy smokers, those smoking more than 20 a day, had a reduced ability to discriminate between contrasts and colors when compared to the non-smokers. The researchers also found significant changes in the smokers’ red-green and blue-yellow color vision, which they noted suggests a link between consuming substances with neurotoxic chemicals, such as those found in cigarettes, and overall color vision loss. “Cigarette smoke consists of numerous compounds that are harmful to health, and it has been linked to a reduction in the thickness of layers in the brain, and to brain lesions, involving areas such as the frontal lobe, which plays a role in voluntary movement and control of thinking, and a decrease in activity in the area of the brain that processes vision,” said co-author Steven Silverstein. “Previous studies have pointed to long-term smoking as doubling the risk for age-related macular degeneration and as a factor causing lens yellowing and inflammation,” he explained. “Our results indicate that excessive use of cigarettes, or chronic exposure to their compounds, affects visual discrimination, supporting the existence of overall deficits in visual processing with tobacco addiction.” JB RELATED STORIES: Posting too many selfies (selfitis) a mental disorder?

"Feeling stressed out? Think of your partner to keep your blood pressure down, says study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/322483/feeling-stressed-out-think-of-your-partner-to-keep-your-blood-pressure-down-says-study/,"02:31 PM January 28, 2019","New United States research has found that when encountering a stressful situation, those who are in a romantic relationship may be able to prevent an increase in blood pressure just by thinking of their partner. Carried out by psychologists at the University of Arizona, the new study recruited 102 participants who were all in committed romantic relationships and asked them to complete a stressful task, which involved placing one foot into cold water. The participants were assigned to one of three conditions during the task, either completing the task with their partner sitting in the room with them; thinking about their partner as a source of support during the task despite him or her not being there; or thinking about their day. The researchers also measured participants’ blood pressure, heart rate and heart rate variability before, during and after. The findings, published in the journal Psychophysiology, showed that participants who had their partner physically present in the room, or who thought about their partner, had a lower blood pressure response to the stress of the cold water than the participants in the group who were instructed to think about their day. Moreover, the effect on the blood pressure reaction was just as strong whether the partner was physically present or whether participants were just thinking of them. However, there was no difference in heart rate and heart rate variability between the three groups. Lead author Kyle Bourassa commented on the findings, saying they may help explain why previous research has linked committed romantic relationships to improved health. “This suggests that one way being in a romantic relationship might support people’s health is through allowing people to better cope with stress and lower levels of cardiovascular reactivity to stress across the day,” Bourassa said. “And it appears that thinking of your partner as a source of support can be just as powerful as actually having them present.” Although further research is needed to replicate the findings, Bourassa said the results could have implications for those facing everyday stressful situations. “Life is full of stress, and one critical way we can manage this stress is through our relationships, either with our partner directly or by calling on a mental image of that person,” Bourassa said. “There are many situations, including at work, with school exams or even during medical procedures, where we would benefit from limiting our degree of blood pressure reactivity, and these findings suggest that a relational approach to doing so can be quite powerful.” JB RELATED STORIES: How being married can protect your heart Can being married bring long-term happiness?

Role-play before sex,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/321732/role-play-before-sex/,"07:46 PM January 20, 2019","Dear Dr G, I understand that being a urologist, you usually address issues related to male sexual health. However, I hope in the New Year, you can also help female readers, like myself, who encounter sexual issues with their husbands. My husband and I have been married for two years, and we dated for two years prior to that. We both have conservative upbringings and never really engaged in sexual relationship prior to getting married. Overall, my husband is a caring partner and very conscientious. However, he is rather shy in bedroom matters and multiple attempts of sex had failed. I think my husband is nervous and anxious, especially due to pressure from the family to have a baby. He tends to rush into the “business” and this can be a turn off for me, resulting in disappointment. I initiated sex a few times, asking him to focus on foreplay and take things slower. I even suggested role-play in the foreplay to help us relax. My husband was excited with the whole idea, but simply clueless of where to start. Needless to say, asking him to see a doctor will be impossible. This week, I am hoping to put Dr G on the spot in assisting men in the initiation of foreplay and incorporating role-play. If so, what scenario would be best for role-play for beginners like us? I understand it is unconventional for a woman to ask for help in sex, but I think your guidance may just save our marriage. Regards, Unconventional woman Foreplay is generally considered intimate behavior between couples to generate emotional and physical readiness for sexual activities. The initiation of foreplay derives from either one or both partners, signalling physiological and mental anticipation of expected sex. Such pre-coital initiation is believed to lower inhibition, increases emotional desire and stimulate sexuality in both partners. Degree of foreplay to generate a person’s sexuality can vary between individuals and different intensity of a relationship. The sexual stimuli may range from a subtle romantic indication, or outright provocation of erotic stimuli. There are many historical references to foreplay, especially depicted by the ancient Indian “sexual arts” of Kama Sutra, demonstrating different types of embracing, caressing, kissing or even spanking as fore “play”! Although certain erotic stimuli can invoke sexual arousal, certain sexual acts of foreplay may be an absolute turn-off, perhaps due to issues of morality. Therefore the “right” preferences of foreplay will require open communication and constant exploration between partners. The initiation is by far the most important step in foreplay. The process can begin with non-physical gesture of whispering, teasing and flirting to generate sexual interests. Further advancement can arouse sexual interests by one partner wearing suggestive clothing, then followed by stripping and nudity. Lastly, passionate French kissing and manual or oral touching of multiple erogenous zones surely will heighten the sexual intensity in the initiation of foreplay. A person’s sexual inhibition and shyness is generally known to create a negative impact. Certain individuals may simply feel uncomfortable, and perceive acts of kissing and caressing intrusive. Role-play in foreplay is generally a good way to overcome such inhibition. Physiologically, role-play of different scenario creates certain levels of confidence and trust between couples to intensify intimacy. Role-play can have strong erotic elements, involving couples to act out roles in sexual fantasy. Typical fantasy would be medical fetishism of doctor and nurse, or office scenario of executive and secretary. The “success” of role-play in foreplay to enhance sexual experience is only achievable when both parties are willing to communicate and explore. NBA professional basketball player, Michael Jordan, once said: “Just play, have fun and enjoy the game!” It is not uncommon for inexperienced newly wed couples to face the obstacles of sexual intimacy due to shyness and inhibitions. Oftentimes, it is counterproductive to over analyze the issues to “curate” the sexual experience. When Dr G is put on the spot by couples facing trouble of initiating foreplay, his advice is: “Just play, have fun and enjoy each other!” Dr George Lee Dr George Lee is a consultant Urologist and Clinical Associate Professor whose professional interest is in men’s health. The column “Putting Dr G on the spot” is a forum to help men debunk the myths and taboos on men’s issues that may be too “hard” to mention.  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2019
How to use a condom properly,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320991/how-to-use-a-condom-properly/,"04:15 PM January 14, 2019","Don’t shy away from the topic of condoms, as this unglamorous contraceptive is one of the most effective methods of preventing sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) and unplanned pregnancies. There tends to be an unfair stigma against discussing condoms, let alone using them. Once, while attending a talk on sexual health, a condom was passed around for the participants to get a closer look. To my amusement, one horrified participant barely touched the new unused sample condom before tossing it on, sending it flying to the ground. It turns out that the participant had never touched a condom before, new or used, and was surprised to feel an oily film on the sample. The reason condoms are so highly espoused and recommended by sexual health experts is because they are an affordable and highly effective way of preventing unplanned pregnancies, and more critically, STDs. Condoms, as you know, come in a shape that fits a man’s penis and is worn like a sort of glove, containing unwanted semen within it and keeping out vaginal fluids. According to Planned Parenthood, a leading non-profit reproductive health organisation in the United States, condoms are 85% effective in real life, i.e. out of 100 women who have intercourse using a condom, only about 15 will get pregnant. As for protection against STDs and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) point to clinical trials and research that consistently indicate that the use of rubber condoms (in particular) are highly effective in stopping pathogens from being passed on to another person through sex. Common features of condoms Although we are discussing male condoms, ladies, knowledge is power; you stand to gain by knowing several common things about condoms on the market: • They are made of latex, lambskin, or even plastic. The most common material used for condoms is latex, hence, condoms are often nicknamed “rubbers”. Unfortunately, some people are allergic to latex, so rather than risk a night of intimacy turning into a nightmare of itchiness, you can turn to condoms made from polyisoprene or polyurethane, types of plastics that are good substitutes for natural rubber. There are also lambskin condoms, which are processed from the real intestines of lambs. They can prevent pregnancies, but not STDs. • Some condoms are lubricated. A brand new condom comes packaged in a sealed, air-tight packet, partially to prevent the thin film of lubrication applied to the condom from drying out. The lubrication is essential to keep the condom from breaking, and if you choose non-lubricated condoms, you’ll still want to apply a proper lubricant (not Vaseline) for more comfortable use. • Some condoms have spermicide. In keeping with its purpose of preventing pregnancies, condom manufacturers have created versions that are coated with spermicide. However, the effectiveness is questionable, and it’s better to consult your doctor for proper family planning strategies. • Some condoms are textured. For a more “pleasurable experience”, there are condoms that are not only lubricated, but also studded or ribbed. • Some condoms are durian-flavored. Yes, you read that correctly. Presumably, this is a gimmick to attract durian lovers to try out condoms. In any case, just like glow-in-the-dark condoms and many other types of novelty condoms, read the labels to ensure they are manufactured by reputable condom brands before buying. Not all novelty condoms found in sex shops safeguard against STDs. How to use a condom properly We know that condoms are not 100% effective, as accidents like breakage can happen or it is not used correctly. In order to maximise condom use, here some are some tried-and-true tips to follow: • Ensure that you are using the right size. A condom that is the right fit won’t slip or feel too tight, and will do a good job. In general, condoms are sold in sizes ranging between 6.5-8.5 inches (16.5-21.6cm) in length, as well as various widths. They are also often classified as small, medium large, and even extra large. And then there are those with cheeky names like “anaconda” or “king kong”, but those are usually marketing gimmicks – extra large genitals are quite uncommon! If you are new to condom buying, it is recommended to measure the length of your partner’s erect penis. This is not an awkward thing to do, as buying the right size will save you money and avoid embarrassment. • Check the expiry dates and be careful when opening the package. Condoms closer to their expiry date lose their efficiency and will be prone to breakage. If you store condoms for more than six months in our hot and humid weather, it is best to check them for leaks in the packaging and freshness. Be careful not to tear the condom as you are opening the foil, and discard if it is sticky or brittle. • Put it on right and keep it on the whole time. A condom must be applied to an erect penis. Place the unrolled condom over the top of the penis with the tip facing upward. The rim should face outward, enabling you to roll it easily down the penis shaft. Gently pinch the tip of the condom to create a small space for semen collection, then roll the condom all the way down the shaft with your other hand. • If it breaks, use a new condom. Stop immediately, carefully pull out and put on a new one. • Prevent spillage. When the penis loses its erection (at any time, but most commonly after ejaculating), carefully pull out without spilling any semen or losing the condom inside the vagina, as this will defeat the purpose of using a condom. Reducing the awkwardness From a health point of view, there isn’t really any good excuse for not using a condom. Believe it or not, sometimes the reasons why people choose not to use condoms can be as simplistic as not knowing how to use it properly, it seeming unnatural, or even being too embarrassed to buy one. Here are a couple of tips to tackle those issues: • Buy online or from a pharmacy. It’s understandable to want to avoid the potentially embarrassing situation of paying for condoms at a convenience store. Luckily, technology has made our lives easier by making many products available for purchasing online, with express shipping options. Buying from a pharmacy might be a more forgiving experience as well, as staff there should be used to such purchases, and hopefully, less judgemental of those who buy them. But at the end of the day, remind yourself that buying condoms is a right and there is nothing wrong with buying it with confidence. • Practice, practice, practice. It’s always good to practice unrolling condoms if you’ve never used one before or just getting started with them. Unless the condoms themselves are designed with a space to collect semen, it’s also good to know how to pinch and hold the tip correctly as you unroll. Knowing all this and being comfortable with condom usage builds more confidence when in bed, and will allow you and your partner to bond. Finally, always store unopened condoms in cool, dry storage, away from high temperatures and direct sunlight. While it might be a cliche to hear people say that they store their condoms “in the sock drawer”, that is probably one of the best places to help prolong the shelf life of your condoms.

Hainan envisions China as a medical tourism destination,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/320412/hainan-envisions-china-as-a-medical-tourism-destination/,"04:29 PM January 08, 2019","BEIJING — Southern China’s Hainan province has unveiled plans aimed at building the tropical island into a world-class medical tourism hub, combining high-end medical tourism with characteristic Chinese healthcare. The move follows a plan released a week ago by the National Development and Reform Commission to encourage tourism-related activities in Hainan, such as medical tourism, horse racing, sports betting and an instant lottery. Focusing on four key areas — medical treatment, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation and health promotion — Hainan will introduce internationally renowned institutions, insurance providers and intermediary service agencies to build a high-end foundation for the international medical tourism market, the plan said. In 10 years, Hainan is projected to become a major medical tourism destination with total annual business revenue reaching 40 billion yuan ($5.84 billion). Eight major tourism projects will be developed, covering fields such as cancer treatment and rehabilitation, fertility therapy, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease treatment and rehabilitation, environmental healing and sports recuperation, traditional Chinese medicine and spiritual retreat. Medical tourism has become one of the world’s fastest-growing emerging industries, and Hainan has unique conditions for developing it, Governor Shen Xiaoming said on the sidelines of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2018 in April. Under the plan, Hainan will tap its characteristic resources of vast coastal areas, tropical rainforests and hot springs to cultivate innovative healthcare and leisure products, and develop a high-end and characteristic medical tourism service system. It will strive to establish a complete healthcare tourism service system that provides high-end, precision medical treatment and high-quality specialty in medical beauty and health promotion services, it said To stimulate the industries, Hainan will explore flexible policies, regulatory models and management systems for investment, financing, fiscal and taxation, financial innovation, entry and exit, to create a highland for medical tourism opening up. Worldwide, increasing convenience in transportation, expansion of the internet and improvement of people’s incomes have led to a booming medical tourism industry, which grows at about 20 percent annually around the globe. According to media reports, the business volume of medical tourism jumped to $700 billion in 2017 from $10 billion in 2000. In China, more than 600,000 people went overseas as medical tourists in 2016. As a demonstration project, launched in 2013 by the State Council to explore international medical tourism, Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone has been granted nine special preferential policies including permission to import medical technology, equipment and medicine, and cutting-edge technological research on stem cells before other parts of China. Twenty-seven medical projects have been completed or are under construction in the pilot zone, and another 38 projects have passed medical technology appraisals. Eight projects are now open. All projects in the pilot zone are targeted to be completed within five years. According to Shen, the pilot zone will first attract domestic patients who would otherwise travel abroad, and later patients from Southeast and even the whole of Asia. Last year, medical institutions in Sanya alone received nearly 20,000 medical tourists from overseas. “Hainan will first attract domestic tourists with advantages of prices, convenience, language and culture over outbound medical tourism,’’ said Chen Yang­le, a professor at Hainan University’s Tourism College. “The industry will also attract international medical institution investors. … In the long run, there will also be comparative advantages for Hainan to attract medical tourists from southeast Asian countries and other areas in terms of natural environment, favorable policies and convenient air services,’’ said Chen.

Transmongolian: The beauty queen breaking barriers,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/319325/transmongolian-the-beauty-queen-breaking-barriers/,"01:48 PM December 28, 2018","Make-up artist Solongo Batsukh braves Mongolia’s below-freezing temperatures in just a skimpy black dress and light pastel pink coat — the country’s trailblazing transgender beauty queen wants to look good in any weather. “I don’t like to look puffy,” the 25-year-old said as she drove to a beauty salon that hired her to promote its products and services via Facebook live videos. It’s with this typical bluntness, confidence and attitude that taboo-breaking Batsukh strutted into the country’s first ever Miss Universe Mongolia competition in October. Though she fell short of representing her country at the Miss Universe contest in Thailand on December 17, her participation shed another light onto a group living on the edges of a deeply patriarchal country with conservative views about sexual orientation. Had she won, she would have joined Miss Spain’s Angela Ponce as the first transgender contestants in Miss Universe’s 66-year history. “I wanted to inspire as many women as possible,” Batsukh told AFP. “But I’m still proud that I got the chance to compete in this contest, and the ‘Solongo’ I created was a true winner in my heart,” she said. Her participation didn’t please everyone, dredging up negative reactions on social media. “The world would have a negative image of our country if a man represents us while there are thousands of beautiful and real women in our country,” one person wrote on the Facebook page of Miss Universe Mongolia. ‘Correct misunderstandings’ But Batsukh isn’t deterred by such abuse. Born Bilguun Batsukh, she grew up as a boy in the semi-arid central province of Dundgovi. She couldn’t pinpoint her gender identity until she learned about different gender orientations as a university student in her early 20s. It was when she started working as a program officer at Youth for Health, a non-governmental organization that provides safe-sex education for LGBT people, that she realized she was a woman born in a man’s body. She started wearing wigs, putting on dresses and taking hormone therapy. Batsukh is among the few LGBT people who have dared to come out in Mongolia, where some 80 percent of the community remain in the closet, according to a UN survey. “It is extremely difficult for transgender people to be employed,” said Baldangombo Altangerel, legal program manager at the LGBT Center. A video of a young transgender woman who had repeatedly been beaten in the streets went viral in Mongolia last year, highlighting the prejudices LGBT people face. Batsukh wants to dispel the image that transgender women can only be sex workers or strippers living on the fringes of society. She flaunts her wealth, regularly travels abroad and is a celebrity in her country of three million people. Batsukh found fame in 2014, when she represented Mongolia in Miss International Queen, finishing in the top 10 of the international transgender beauty pageant organised in Thailand. She pursued a modelling career and became a make-up artist. “I had to reveal myself (as transgender) so I could correct the misunderstandings in society. If we keep hidden, society will keep on hating us. They don’t know us,” she said. Batsukh has used her public image to speak up on television and social media, fighting against perceptions that  transgender people are suffering from mental illness. But she has tough words for Mongolia’s transgender community, too, complaining that they should focus on working rather than talking about human rights. “Instead of saying ‘we’re human like everyone else’, we need to prove ourselves through our actions. Just show others that we’re making a living like ordinary people,” she said. ‘Her goals inspire me’ Batsukh is seizing on the popularity of her Facebook page, which has more than 120,000 “likes”, to create a reality show featuring women seeking a makeover. The beauty queen will help the women lose weight, change hairstyles and apply make-up. Sarangoo Sukhbaatar, 25, who works in a cashmere company and was among 25 women competing to be among the five participants, said she trusted in Batsukh’s ability and skills to transform her looks. “Solongo truly understands what women feel,” said Sukhbaatar, who started following Batsukh on social media two years ago. “Her goals and patience inspire me,” she said. “If a man can be beautiful like her, women can be much more beautiful than we are today.” CC RELATED STORIES: Meet Angela Ponce: The first transgender woman joining Miss Universe  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018

But when she sashayed on the Miss Universe stage in Thailand, she brought with her on stage her love for children and her advocacy of helping them. Gray swept the world, or the universe rather, when she nailed the final question and answer portion, focusing her answer on the welfare of children. The question was: “What is the most important lesson you’ve learned in your life and how would you apply it to your time as Miss Universe?” Gray answered: “I work a lot in the slums of Tondo, Manila, and the life there is… it’s poor and very sad. I’ve always taught myself to look for the beauty of it, to look for beauty in the faces of the children and to be grateful…” “If I could also teach people to be grateful, we could have an amazing world where negativity could not grow and foster, and children would have a smile on their faces,” she added. In her opening statement when she entered the top 10, she also zeroed in on children, saying that it was “lack of child support, not poverty, that killed their dreams.” “I stand here today because someone believed in me and we owe it to our children to believe in them,” she added. However, even before joining the Miss Universe pageant, her heart has always been with children. In 2016, Gray worked at a non-profit organization, Young Focus International, which aimed to “improve the mental, physical, and social well-being of young people in poor communities by means of education, health care, and personal support.” In 2016, when she competed in Miss World, Gray started a charity project called “Paraiso: The Bright Beginnings Project.” She helped raise funds to transform an old apartment building in Manila to a pre-school for children from ages three to five. Last November, Gray dedicated a song, “We’re In This Together,” and its music video to children produced by Young Focus International. /ee  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
Indonesia’s SidoMuncul sets the bar in herbal industry,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/313421/indonesias-sidomuncul-sets-the-bar-in-herbal-industry/,"02:15 PM November 26, 2018","For many years, people have sought relief in alternative medicinal solutions like traditional, herbal, or all-natural remedies. Filipinos are also no strangers to herbal products and remedies—thinking that it is safer, cheaper, healthier, and more practical since some of the herbs known to have medicinal benefits can be homegrown. In Indonesia, people turn to herbal products and traditional medicines known as “jamu” to ease some of their health problems. Long before modern medication prevailed in the pharmaceutical industry, Indonesians relied on traditional remedies and conventional medicines like many other Asian countries. According to a report by Euromonitor International, “Indonesian consumers perceive herbal ingredients as healthier compared to chemical medications.” Tolak Angin is Indonesia’s leading herbal supplement that is made from some of the finest herbs that help boost the immune system and alleviate symptoms associated with feeling unwell such as flatulence, nausea, sneezing, headache, fatigue, motion sickness, and could also be beneficial for digestive health. It is the signature product of PT Industri Jamu dan Farmasi SidoMuncul Tbk (SidoMuncul), a world-leading herbal specialist who engages in the production of herbal and traditional medicines and pharmaceutical business. For 67 years, SidoMuncul has continued to grow with several variants of herbal products including: herbal formula and supplements, herbal beverages and confectioneries, energy drink, and others—making them the biggest herbal company in Indonesia and one of the fastest-growing herbal innovators in the world. From Indonesia to the Philippines SidoMuncul started as a home industry in Yogyakarta, Indonesia and was pioneered by Rachmad Sulistio in 1940. Due to the war her family moved to Semarang and then in 1951 they established the company Sido Muncul, which means “a dream come true.” Today, herbal products are still popular among Indonesians and herbal supplements like Tolak Angin have become a part of their daily lives. Whether suffering from upset stomach, chills, dizziness or nausea —Indonesians always have a ready-to-drink sachet of Tolak Angin with them. The company used to produce Tolak Angin in powder form; however, to feed the demand for a more consumer-friendly product of herbal medicines. In 1992, Tolak Angin was developed into liquid form through modern technology. In spite of its traditional roots, SidoMuncul’s herbal products are now produced in a modern and environmental-friendly factory in Semarang, Indonesia. A waste management device is installed in the plant to treat its waste and turn it into water that meets the standard from the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry. They also process their solid waste into wood pellets that are used to fuel the plant’s production. Using state-of-the-art equipment, SidoMuncul ensures that their products go through elaborate process of sanitation and quality control before making it to the market. Sido Muncul’s factory is certified with GMP Standard (Good Manufacturing Practices) and is equipped with 3 supporting laboratories for research and development, quality control, and quality assurance to produce a standardized good quality product. With the popularity of Tolak Angin and the continuous demand for herbal products in the market, SidoMuncul is expanding its reach across several countries around the world including: USA, Australia,  Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Philippines. “You can find Tolak Angin almost anywhere in the world… in stores that sell Asian products especially Indonesian products. This year we’ll introduce the product into the Philippine market and we hope that the Filipino people can experience the benefits of this product,” says Irwan Hidayat, President and Director of Sido Muncul. Hidayat adds that he’s hoping Filipinos will accept and trust the product as much as Indonesians have for many decades. “We hope that people there can feel the efficacy of Tolak Angin when they experience problems of colds such as upset stomach, nausea, feverish, motion sickness and others. I hope they’ll believe in our product.” An all-natural wonder Indonesia is known to have some of the world’s richest natural resources and is home to highly diversified herbal products and traditional medicines. Tolak Angin was the first product of SidoMuncul that paved way for the company to venture into traditional herbal remedies that aims to better people’s quality of life. Tolak Angin, which translates to “expel the wind” was made as a remedy for when people experience masuk angin (entry of the wind or “lamig”) and other ailments caused by a weakened immune system. The FDA-approved formula is made from the following high quality herbs that work together to help boost the body’s immune system: To prove the efficacy and safety of SidoMuncul, the company collaborated with researchers from the College of Pharmacy of Sanata Dharma University in Yogyakarta to do a subchronic toxicity test, and the medical faculty of Diponegoro University in Semarang to conduct an in vivo research. The subchronic test proved that Tolak Angin is safe to be consumed for long periods, based on the recommended dosage, while the results from the in vivo research indicated an increase in immune system activity after taking Tolak Angin. “Isang ‘Tolak’ lang ‘yan!” With the unpredictable weather, exposure to pollution from daily traffic, and stress from work, it’s easy for anyone to catch diseases and pass it on to others. Filipinos who are living in Indonesia also take Tolak Angin and treat it as their “first aid” whenever they feel under the weather. For them, Tolak Angin gives an immediate soothing effect as it instantly warms the body — making them feel better. Others also rely on Tolak Angin whenever they have upset stomach and digestive problems or when they feel fatigued. Tolak Angin can be consumed directly from the sachet, or mixed with hot water, tea, or coffee.

Giant Damien Hirst uterus sculptures catch eye at Qatar hospital,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/314333/giant-damien-hirst-uterus-sculptures-catch-eye-at-qatar-hospital/,"05:44 PM November 19, 2018","Fourteen giant bronze sculptures by British artist Damien Hirst graphically charting the moment of conception to birth greet patients arriving at an $8-billion hospital in Gulf state Qatar. The vast open-air installation, named “The Miraculous Journey”, shows a fetus growing in the womb and culminates with a 14-meter(46-feet) of a naked baby just after birth. The monumental work is the centerpiece of an impressive modern art collection at the Sidra Medicine Hospital, officially opened this week in Doha, that would be the envy of many galleries around the world. “We believe it reflects very much the mission of Sidra, taking care of the healthcare of woman and babies,” said Layla Ibrahim Bacha, art specialist with the government-supported Qatar Foundation, which owns most of the artwork. “I think it’s perfect for the location, as you can see a lot of people are taking pictures, I think its becoming iconic.” Among the 65 works at the specialty facility for children’s and women’s health are pieces by high-profile international names and artists from across the Arab world, including Qatar. A fourth-floor outpatient clinic is decorated with a neon installation entitled “I Listen To The Ocean And All I Hear Is You” by Tracey Emin, one of Hirst’s ground-breaking contemporaries from Britain. Bacha says the art was chosen with “very specific themes” in mind. “They are not meant to be decorative, they are meant to be more creating debates, helping with the patient to keep calm,” she said. Syrian artist, Jaber al-Azmeh, whose pictures hang in the hospital, told AFP that it makes him “smile” to imagine his photographs on display in a place where new lives are starting. Sidra began receiving its first patients in January and last month successfully conducted Qatar’s first conjoined twin separation surgery. Energy-rich Qatar has become a major buyer of contemporary art. It is seeking to portray itself as one of the most progressive states in the region against the backdrop of a bitter standoff with Gulf rivals led by Saudi Arabia. But that does not mean there has not been some controversy over the Damien Hirst works towering outside the hospital. The sculptures were originally unveiled in October 2013 but then covered from public view until recent weeks. The official reason was to protect them from ongoing building work on the hospital, but they were concealed after a social media outcry. “We are not expecting everyone to like them. We are not expecting everyone to understand them,” said Bacha. “This is why they are there to actually create this element of debate, this element of thinking.” CC RELATED STORIES: Damien Hirst donates pre-historic item for gala Missing St. Mark mosaic finally returns to Cyprus  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
5 surefire ways to you can let your kids make the most of their childhood,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/308596/5-surefire-ways-to-you-can-let-your-kids-make-the-most-of-their-childhood/,"05:50 PM November 16, 2018","We were all kids once. For many of us, early childhood is one of the few parts of our lives that give us a rush of good memories that last a lifetime. Some remember hopping over Chinese garters in sunny afternoons while others can recall spending hours looking for their friends in the dark during a game of tagu-taguan. While we may have been raised differently, we can all say we know of the universal experience of youth where things were always fun, exciting, and nurturing. As parents, you want to make sure your kids go through the same thing. They won’t stay little for very long but with these tips, you can ensure your kids make the most of their own childhood:  Let Your Kids Engage with Their Peers Many parents often resort to phones and tablets as a form of entertainment for their kids. While giving them a mobile device is the most convenient way to keep them quiet and preoccupied, this could be robbing them of doing something more productive, such as building their interpersonal skills. Instead of letting your kids spend most of their days indoors, encourage them to go outside and play with other children. Introduce your children to your neighbor’s kids and organize sleepovers whenever you can. This way, your children can make lasting and more meaningful relationships with their peer in a safe and secure environment.  Allow Your Kids to Discover Their Passions Do you remember the first time you found out what your talents were, be it painting or singing? Your parents wouldn’t stop bragging about you to your other relatives at family reunions and to their friends when they bump into them at the grocery. These talents eventually became part of who you are and helped shape your career path and future. If your child seems to follow you around the kitchen and express deep curiosity over how you make your food, ask them if they want to attend cooking classes. For the energetic kids who know how to kick a ball, enroll them in summer sports lessons. If their interests change over time, that’s okay too. Support them in their path of discovery – their childhood is the best time to begin exploring their passions.  Spend Quality Time with Your Children These days, parents often cite work as a reason for not seeing their children as often as they could. Although work helps pay the bills, family time is just as important, especially as a child. This time in your child’s life is where you get to build a close bond with them as early as possible and make sure they know you only care about their wellbeing. Many adulthood traumas stem from rocky childhoods so it’d be best if you establish a loving, trusting relationship early on in their lives.  Travel with Your Kids Many of our best memories are often in places far away from home. There’s always an adrenaline rush to visiting a new city where almost everything is fresh to the eye, from the food and architecture to the art scene and local community. During your children’s summer vacations, take them on a trip to a local province or a foreign country. Travelling with your child helps them see beyond the world they currently live in. Plus, well-travelled children are known to become smarter, more empathetic individuals when they grow up. They gain both memories and knowledge, something that they’ll be grateful for in the future.  Keep Your Children Healthy In encouraging your child to enjoy their childhood, don’t forget to prioritize their health, too. An active child would need a balanced, healthy diet so they can seize the day ahead. If your children are picky about their food, you’ll need food supplements to give them the nutrients they need. FERN Kiddimin is a food supplement that contains the essential vitamins and amino acids that help give the nourishment and energy they need to make the most of their day. It has Taurine & Vitamin A to help improve mental quickness, Lysine & Vitamin B Complex to help stimulate healthy appetite, and Chlorella and Vitamin D3 to help develop a strong body. Always put your child’s health first, because a healthy child is a happy one. FERN Kiddimin is an orange-flavored food supplement that comes in 120mL and 60mL bottles at a suggested retail price of P158 and P88, respectively. #AngSarapMagingKid #FERNKiddimin ASC No. F110N102618F ADVT  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
"On the menu in 2019: Kernza, tempeh and celtuce",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/313366/p2fb-on-the-menu-in-2019-kernza-tempeh-and-celtuce/,"09:21 PM November 13, 2018","While the latest SIAL international food exhibition in Paris outlined the food innovations of tomorrow, a Nov. 12 report from the American food industry trends researcher, Sterling-Rice Group, runs down the top trends that are set to make the taste of 2019. Here are some of the report’s biggest and most surprising trends. Roots rule As veggies ride high in the food world, pushing meat into the background, a new line-up of vegetables is ready to take the spotlight and liven up plates in 2019. Roots look set to be a particular trend. Joining a host of previously forgotten vegetables, back on menus for a while now, next year will see cassava, Japanese yams and parsnips claim star status. Watch out for jicama too, a Mexican root vegetable that looks like a turnip, which can be used cooked or raw. Bitter is better The culinary landscape at last appears set to truly embrace bitterness. Members of this family of flavors, such as broccoli rabe, dandelion greens, collards and endive, will be sharing the stage with kale. According to the report, bitter will also be a key theme for cocktails and drinks. Fermentation celebration Fermented foods are another key trend for 2019, embracing the full benefits of bacteria. The process, already used to make cheese, for example, is set to become more prevalent in the coming year with a rise in foods such as tempeh. This Indonesian meat alternative and relation of tofu is made by fermenting hulled and cooked soybeans. Lettuce praise Could celtuce be the new kale? Lettuce is now on the menu in several forms and is even being juiced for use in intriguing new beverages. More exotic varieties are likely to step into the limelight next year, such as celtuce or stem lettuce, widely used in Asian cuisine. Kernza: the latest grain After millet, quinoa and buckwheat, Kernza is the latest grain to sample. Kernza is a perennial plant derived from wheat, grown in North American for use in breakfast cereals, snacks and even beer, and its production is particularly praised by environmental protectionists. Kernza was developed by an American scientific institute seeking to develop a cereal capable of restoring soil while helping to stabilize the climate. Feel-good food A trend seen at the recent SIAL exhibition, foods developed to satisfy appetites and preserve health will also be on the agenda in 2019. According to the report from Sterling-Rice Group, more than 3,000 new food products featuring collagen launched in 2018.

"Too much screen time affects wellbeing of children and teens, says study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/311841/p2fb-too-much-screen-time-affects-wellbeing-of-children-and-teens-says-study/,"07:27 PM October 31, 2018","New United States research has found that just one hour of screen time can affect children’s and teens’ behavior. Even children as young as two are at risk of higher levels of anxiety and depression due to time spent on smartphones or watching television. The study, by researchers at San Diego State University and the University of Georgia, looked at data gathered from the National Survey of Children’s Health carried out in 2016. The researchers analyzed 40,337 surveys completed by caregivers of children aged 2 to 17, who were asked about the children’s existing medical care, emotional, developmental and behavioral issues, and youth behaviors, including daily screen time. The findings, published in Preventative Medicine Reports, showed that more hours of screen time are associated with lower well-being in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17, with high users showing less curiosity, self-control, and emotional stability. Among preschoolers, high users of screens were twice as likely to often lose their temper and 46 percent more likely to be unable to calm down when excited. Around 22.6 percent of those aged 11 to 13 who spent more than seven hours with screens daily were not curious or interested in learning new things, compared to 13.8 percent of those who spent four hours on screen and around 9 percent of those who spent one hour in front of a screen. Teens who spent more than seven hours a day on screens were twice as likely as those spending just one hour on a screen to have been diagnosed with anxiety or depression, a significant finding according to the researchers. In addition, 42.2 percent of teens aged 14 to 17 who spent more than seven hours a day on screens did not finish tasks, compared with 27.7 percent of those who spent fours hours a day on screens and 16.6 percent for those who spent one hour daily in front of a screen. Moreover, the associations between screen time and well-being were stronger among adolescents than among young children. “At first, I was surprised that the associations were larger for adolescents,” commented researcher Jean Twenge. “However, teens spend more time on their phones and on social media, and we know from other research that these activities are more strongly linked to low well-being than watching television and videos, which is most of younger children’s screen time.” Twenge added that the study provides further evidence to support the American Academy of Pediatrics’ established screen time limits — an hour a day for those aged 2 to 5, with a focus on high-quality programs — and suggested that similar limits of perhaps two hours a day should be applied to older school-aged children and adolescents.

Higher levels of vitamin D linked to improved cardiorespiratory fitness,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/311823/higher-levels-of-vitamin-d-linked-to-improved-cardiorespiratory-fitness/,"05:55 PM October 31, 2018","New US research has found that a higher level of vitamin D in the blood is linked to better cardiorespiratory fitness. The study, by researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University, looked at whether people with higher levels of vitamin D in the blood have improved cardiorespiratory fitness. Although it is already known that vitamin D is important for healthy bones, evidence is mounting that it may also play a role in other areas of health and the body, including the heart and muscles. The researchers gathered data on blood serum vitamin D from 1,995 participants aged 20 to 49 years and divided participants into quartiles according to vitamin D levels. The participants also had their cardiorespiratory fitness — the ability of the heart and lungs to supply oxygen to the muscles during exercise — measured. This is best measured as the maximal oxygen consumption during exercise, referred to as VO2 max. The findings, published on Tuesday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, showed that participants with vitamin D levels in the top quartile had a 4.3-fold higher cardiorespiratory fitness than those in the bottom quartile. The link remained significant even after taking into account other potential factors such as age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. “Our study shows that higher levels of vitamin D are associated with better exercise capacity,” said researcher Dr. Amr Marawan. “We also know from previous research that vitamin D has positive effects on the heart and bones. Make sure your vitamin D levels are normal to high. You can do this with diet, supplements, and a sensible amount of sun exposure.” Each 10 nanomole/liter increase in vitamin D was associated with a statistically significant 0.78 milliliter/kilogram/minute increase in VO2 max. “This suggests that there is a dose response relationship, with each rise in vitamin D associated with a rise in exercise capacity,” said Marawan. Marawan also noted that as this was an observational study, the researchers cannot conclude that the improvement in exercise capacity was due to vitamin D. However, he added, “The association was strong, incremental, and consistent across groups. This suggests that there is a robust connection and provides further impetus for having adequate vitamin D levels, which is particularly challenging in cold, cloudy places where people are less exposed to the sun.” However, Vitamin D toxicity can lead to excess calcium in the blood, which can cause nausea, vomiting, and weakness. “It is not the case that the more vitamin D, the better,” said Marawan. “Toxicity is caused by megadoses of supplements rather than diet or sun exposure, so caution is needed when taking tablets.” AB RELATED STORIES: One more reason not to pick your nose – pneumonia Doctors prescribe ‘nature time’ to patients in Scotland Too much screen time, too little horseplay for kids – study  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
"Switching off from work at end of day can improve sleep, lower stress levels",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/311526/switching-off-from-work-at-end-of-day-can-improve-sleep-lower-stress-levels/,"06:28 PM October 29, 2018","New international research has found that continuing work at home could be impacting our sleep and stress levels, and our productivity at work the next day. Carried out by researchers from the University of South Australia, Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands and Kitasato University, Japan, the new study followed 230 healthcare employees over a two-year period. The researchers assessed the effect of whether particular activities after work have a positive or negative effect on cognitive, emotional, and physical detachment from work and sleep quality. The findings, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, showed that continuing to work even after leaving the office, for example by emailing, checking phones, laptops and text messages, has both a short and long-term negative impact on sleep and stress. In addition, this ‘work creep’ reduces our ability to relax and recharge for the next day, actually making us less productive at work. On the other hand, the researchers found that care activities such as housework, cooking and looking after children are positively related to sleep quality, while low-effort activities such as reading, watching television or listening to music helped people switch off from the work. As a consequence, employees are better able to deal with future job demands. Lead researcher Jan de Jonge now advises low-effort activities to detach from the working day, adding that exercise is also a good way to wind down and aid sleep. However de Jonge advises against exercise late at night when it can have the opposite effect by spiking adrenaline and cortisone levels in the body. Previous research has shown that a daytime nap of around 30 minutes can help to restore alertness and improve productivity. Professor Maureen Dollard, Director of UniSA’s Asia Pacific Centre for Work, Health and Safety, commented on the findings saying, “Managers need to create a climate in which working beyond regular hours is not ‘business as usual’ as taking work home impedes cognitive function and productivity.” “Both managers and employees should find creative ways to accomplish job demands within regular work hours.” CC RELATED STORIES: Choosing between stress and paying for sanity Don’t stress yourself out  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
The direct benefits of different yoga poses,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/310659/the-direct-benefits-of-different-yoga-poses/,"12:37 PM October 22, 2018","When it comes to yoga, the benefits to your physical, mental and spiritual health are aplenty. One of the oldest disciplines rooted in practices that belong to ancient India, it’s clear that it survives today because it has helped a lot of people. Recent scientific research reflects that there are proven improvements to a person’s strength, flexibility and balance. This is why many would say taking yoga would help your performance in other sports and exercise routines. Many different schools of yoga flourish, each with different methods. I believe that one must look into the various approaches of yoga to find what’s best suited for your own goals and needs. It also doesn’t hurt to try these schools of thought when it comes to yoga to be certain of what’s best for you. It helps you connect and communicate with your body on a deeper level. But what I want to concentrate on here is how different yoga positions have a direct effect on the body. Since yoga is also about purpose, each yoga pose has a significant meaning. Every position is targeted to a concern you have, from lack of flexibility to weight loss, from stress to simple neck pain. Scroll down to see how five  yoga positions are meant to address a particular body/mental issue. If you’re a newbie or a regular yoga enthusiast, I think knowledge of this will deepen your appreciation for the practice.  1.  Upward Facing Dog Pose for weight loss
Known as the urdhva mukha svanasana, this pose belongs to the traditional sun salutation sequence. You can practice this pose on its own, holding it from 15 to 30 seconds while you breathe easily. 2. Channel Clearing Pose for anti-stress
The nadi shodshana is a step to pranayama, the formal practice of controlling your breath. The pose is to be done only with the guidance of a teacher, especially for beginners, as it involves breathing through one nostril at a time while blocking one nostril with your finger. 3. Extended Triangle Pose for flexibility 
From a mountain pose, where you’re standing straight, big toes touching each other but heels apart, you jump and land around four feet apart. Build slowly until you can place one arm on your shin or ankle, bending on your hips, while the other arm’s to the ceiling. This pose is standard in many different types of yoga and helps increase your overall flexibility. 4. Cow Pose for back pain
When paired with the cat’s pose, the cow pose or bitilasana, helps ease the back of tension and helps warm it up. Kneel while placing your hands flat on the floor as if you were a table. Center your head first before you lift it up, looking ahead. Inhale and while you raise your chest up, leaving your belly down. Exhale when you come back to neutral position. 5. Salutation Seal for carpal tunnel syndrome
I think this is important to know when you work with your hands constantly. The Anjali Mudra can be done sitting or standing while you press your palms against each other, making sure neither hand is dominating the other. This is also the pose you can take to start a five minute meditation aside from relieving the cramped muscles in your arms and hands.

Doctors prescribe ‘nature time’ to patients in Scotland,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/309359/doctors-prescribe-nature-time-patients-scotland/,"03:24 PM October 11, 2018","Doctors in Shetland, Scotland, have started giving out “nature prescriptions,” which involves advising patients to spend some time in nature to supplement their conventional medication. National Health Service of Shetland (NHS Shetland) authorized the issuance of nature prescriptions on Oct. 5 for patients with mental illness, diabetes, heart disease, stress and other conditions, reports The Guardian. Patients who are prescribed their nature time will be given calendars and lists of activities ranging from bird-watching walks to standing still for three minutes just to listen to the wind. These calendars are drawn up by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and will show patients particular bird species and what routes to take to see them. The concept of the program leans on evidence of the positive effects of nature on the human condition. “We would like this to be picked up by other areas or health boards. There is so much evidence that nature is good for us, and this is a simple way to get people outdoors and experiencing nature in a city or a wilder place like Shetland,” said RSPB Scotland area manager Helen Moncrieff. The calendars will also vary per season. For example, a winter prescription focuses more on the elements such as the strong Atlantic winds. “There are millions of different ways of doing medicine but we very much try to involve people in their own health, and people really like being empowered,” said Dr. Chloe Evans, who piloted the program at the Scalloway Health Center on the west coast of Shetland’s main island. Meanwhile, NHS Shetland does not suggest doing away with conventional medication altogether in favor of being one with nature. Instead, the patients’ time in nature are meant to supplement their normal treatments. Healthcare professionals around the United Kingdom have been encouraged to suggest leisurely walks in parks to their patients to help with treatment. The organization NHS Forest Project helps to create the green spaces for the patients, which will be dedicated for healthcare purposes. “The physical and mental benefits of connecting with nature have been very well evidenced by numerous studies,” said NHS spokeswoman Makena Lohr. “It’s high time that the healthcare sector became aware of that.” Alfred Bayle /ra  RELATED STORIES: Too much screen time, too little horseplay for kids – study Yoga: Indian practice turned global phenomenon Stressed-out Dhaka to get ‘Anger Management Park’  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.

"Violinist, professor, pastor among 25 ‘genius grant’ winners",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/308577/violinist-professor-pastor-among-25-genius-grant-winners/,"02:16 PM October 05, 2018","CHICAGO (AP) — A violinist who organizes concerts for the homeless, a professor whose research is being used to increase access to civil justice by poor communities and an activist pastor are among this year’s MacArthur fellows and recipients of so-called genius grants. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation on Thursday named 25 people , including academics, activists, artists, scholars and scientists, who will receive $625,000 over five years to use as they please. The Chicago-based foundation has awarded the fellowships each year since 1981 to people who have shown outstanding talent to help further their creative, professional or intellectual pursuits. Potential fellows are brought to the foundation’s attention by an anonymous pool of nominators. Those selected are sworn to secrecy until their names are announced. Los Angeles Philharmonic first violinist Vijay Gupta said he was “pretty overwhelmed” when he told he was named a MacArthur fellow. He received the honor for being the co-founder and artistic director of Street Symphony, which has performed at homeless shelters, jails and halfway houses for about eight years. “They have reminded me why I became a musician,” Gupta said of the homeless. “Artists have a role in telling the truth about what is happening in our world today.” Gupta, 31, said he got the idea for Street Symphony while giving lessons to Nathaniel Ayers, a Juilliard-trained musician whose mental illness led to homelessness and who was the inspiration for the movie “The Soloist”. “I grew up around mental illness,” Gupta said, noting that he has experienced it. “Our goal is to find more artists aching to have not only their artistry, but also have their human story told as well.” Gupta, who won a spot in the LA Philharmonic at age 19, said he has no idea how he will spend the money, but that it gives him the opportunity to reflect. “I’ve been a performer my entire life, playing the violin at 4 years and on the stage at 7,” he said. “I’ve never had a chance to sit and reflect on what my life will be like. This gives me some space to breathe, plan and look ahead.” Another fellow is Rebecca Sandefur, an associate professor of sociology and law at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. She was told of the award by the MacArthur Fellows Program’s managing director, Cecilia Conrad, who happened to be on campus and had asked to meet about an unrelated matter. “It was an extraordinary experience and a complete shock,” Sandefur said. “It was not something you would expect.” Sandefur’s research is promoting a new approach to increasing access to the justice system by poor communities. She created the first national mapping of civil legal aid providers, revealing which states had the resources to provide such aid and which didn’t. She also determined that cost is only one of many factors that inhibit the use of lawyers by the poor. Among the others are an aversion to lawyers, a fear of and pessimism about the fairness of the legal system, and a lack of understanding about what constitutes a legal issue. Sandefur, 47, contends that while there has been a lot of attention paid to the problems of the criminal justice system, there hasn’t been enough attention paid to the civil side of the law. “It affects millions of people as well,” she said. “A person could lose a house or get evicted, not see kids after a divorce proceeding or get unemployment insurance that they are owed.” Sandefur said the award would be important in helping advance her work. “We are going get some action on a problem that’s been around a long time,” she said. Fellow Gregg Gonsalves, 54, is a global health advocate and assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale University. A longtime HIV/AIDS activist, his work focuses on the use of quantitative analysis and operations research to improve responses to global public health challenges. He co-founded the Global Health Justice Partnership at Yale to advance human rights and social justice perspectives in public health and legal research and teaching. Another of this year’s recipients is Matthew Aucoin, a 28-year-old composer, conductor and artist-in-residence at the Los Angeles Opera. Aucoin composes instrumental works, ranging from pieces for solo performers to compositions for chorus and orchestra. His operatic work “Crossing”, which drew from Walt Whitman’s diary entries during his Civil War work tending to wounded soldiers, premiered in 2015. Ken Ward Jr., an award-winning reporter at the Charleston Gazette-Mail and formerly the Charleston Gazette, was the only journalist on this year’s list. The foundation said Ward was selected because he excels at “revealing the human and environmental toll of natural resource extraction in West Virginia and spurring greater accountability among public and private stakeholders.” Also named a fellow was William J. Barber II, pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and founder of Repairers of the Breach, a leadership development organization. In 2017, Barber began a series of “Moral Monday” rallies outside the North Carolina state Capitol to protest laws that suppress voter turnout. Reached by phone Thursday after the fellows were announced, Barber was participating in — and getting arrested at — a “Fight for $15” minimum wage protest outside of the Chicago corporate headquarters of McDonald’s. He told The Associated Press that the honor just means he has more work ahead of him, not less. “They don’t share these grants so that you sit down. They hope and believe you will do more things,” said Barber, who co-chairs the Poor People’s Campaign, a revival of the movement started by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. just before his assassination.

"Daily drinking increases cancer, mortality risks — study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/308468/daily-drinking-increases-cancer-mortality-risks-study/,"04:48 PM October 04, 2018","While light drinking was found to reduce the risk of heart-related problems, a new study suggests daily drinking eliminates said benefit, increasing one’s mortality risk in the process. A research team from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found that daily drinking increases one’s cancer risk, which in turn, increases the risk of premature death. The study was published in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research journal yesterday, Oct. 3. The team analyzed the data from 340,668 National Health Interview Survey participants ages 18 to 85 and additional 93,653 participants ages 40 to 60 who were treated as outpatients at Veterans Administration clinics in the United States. The research focused on light drinkers — people who consume only one to two drinks a day. The study affirmed earlier studies stating light drinking improves cardiovascular health. However, daily drinking increases one’s mortality risk as a result of increased cancer risk. “Consuming one or two drinks about four days per week seemed to protect against cardiovascular disease, but drinking every day eliminated those benefits,” the study’s author and assistant professor of psychiatry, Sarah M. Hartz said in a statement. “With regard to cancer risk, any drinking at all was detrimental.” Researchers found out “healthy” drinking — consuming one to two alcoholic beverages four or more times per week — increases the risk of premature death by 20 percent in comparison to those who drink three times a week or less. The increased mortality death remained consistent throughout all age groups included in the study. “A 20 percent increase in risk of death is a much bigger deal in older people who already are a higher risk,” Hartz said in a statement. “Relatively few people die in their 20s, so a 20 percent increase in mortality is small but still significant. As people age, their risk of death from any cause also increases, so a 20 percent risk increase at age 75 translates into many more deaths than it does at age 25.” “It used to seem like having one or two drinks per day was no big deal, and there even have been some studies suggesting it can improve health,” she noted. “But now we know that even the lightest daily drinkers have an increased mortality risk.” JB RELATED STORIES: Dementia risk higher for middle-aged non-drinkers, study suggests Drinking alcohol moderately can protect your heart, study finds  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
Frequently talking with your teen about sex can encourage safe sex later in life,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/308456/frequently-talking-teen-sex-can-encourage-safe-sex-later-life/,"02:19 PM October 04, 2018","New United States research has found that parents who communicate often and openly with their teens about sex could be encouraging them to practice safer sex later in life. Carried out by Laura Padilla-Walker, a family life professor at Brigham Young University, the new study recruited 468 14 to 18-year-old teenagers and their mothers, plus 311 of their fathers, and followed them over a 10-year period. Although previous research has suggested that parents can be an important source of sex education for their children, Padilla-Walker explains that little is known about how this type of communication changes between parents and children over time, and how these changes may affect teenage behaviors related to sexual risk. Padilla-Walker contacted the families every summer over 10 years to evaluate the level of communication between parents and children about sexuality and avoiding sexual risk. The findings, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, showed that both teenagers and their parents reported relatively low levels of sexual communication, which stayed relatively constant over the course of the study, although teens reported even lower levels than their parents did. “Whether or not parents think they are talking about sexuality often, children are generally reporting low levels of communication,” said Padilla-Walker. “So parents need to increase sex communication even if they feel they are doing an adequate job.” The results also suggested that ongoing communication between parents and teens about sex not only boosted the parent-child relationship but also appeared to lead to safer sexual activity at age 21, which Padilla-Walker says should encourage parents to have conversations with their children about sex and sexual health. Although she acknowledges these conversations may be awkward, she added that just one generic talk with children about sex is not enough. Talking more about sex can help adolescents feel safe going to their parents with questions and concerns. “Our current culture is highly sexualized, so children are learning about sexuality in a fragmented way from an early age,” said Padilla-Walker. “Research suggests that parents can be an effective means of teaching their children about sexuality in a developmentally appropriate manner, but that does not occur if parents only have a single, uncomfortable, often one-sided talk.” “I would like to see an upward trajectory of parent-child communication as children age,” she said. “Parents should talk frequently with their children about many aspects of sexuality in a way that helps the child to feel comfortable and heard, but never shamed.” JB RELATED STORIES: LOOK: Dad shares struggle of changing kids’ diapers in men’s restrooms  Too much screen time is no. 1 reason for teenage sleep problems, says new survey   CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
Philip Roth paid tribute by friends and fellow writers in memorial,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/307602/philip-roth-paid-tribute-friends-fellow-writers-memorial/,"05:56 PM September 26, 2018","NEW YORK (AP) — Philip Roth had it all planned. “Many years ago, I received in the mail a letter in which he outlined the instructions for his memorial service,” his close friend Joel Conarroe told a gathering of hundreds Tuesday during a tribute at the midtown Manhattan branch of the New York Public Library. The author of “American Pastoral,” ”Portnoy’s Complaint” and other celebrated novels was as precise about his death, Conarroe explained, as he had been about his life and work. Attendees included Robert Caro, Salman Rushdie, Mia Farrow and Don DeLillo and speakers ranged from Conarroe, president emeritus of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, to fellow authors such as Edna O’Brien, Norman Manea and Judith Thurman. The setting, the library’s Celeste Bartos Forum and its glass-domed ceiling, was requested by Roth. So were the speakers, even though the list changed over time as such previous choices as Saul Bellow and William Styron passed away. Roth also picked out the music, Gabriel Faure’s “Elegie in C Minor, op. 24, which ended the nearly 2 ½-hour ceremony. Roth died in May. He was 85. According to Conarroe, Roth wanted as much laughter as tears, and guests shared memories of his wit and of the surprising tenderness for a man so direct and unsparing in his work. Thurman spoke of driving around Connecticut with Roth as he searched for a proper burial spot, what he called “A tomb with a view.” New Yorker staff writer Claudia Roth Pierpont noted that he referred to his Manhattan neighborhood, where other authors lived nearby, as “Writers’ Block.” Roth never had children, but friends remembered his rapport and sense of play with their kids, whether collaborating through email on stories with them or sitting on the floor of his darkened studio and shining a light on the ceiling to make the room seem like a planetarium. Roth despised sentimentality nearly as much he hated death, but he apparently had exceptions. Bernard Avishai, a Dartmouth College professor who wrote a book about “Portnoy’s Complaint,” remembered Roth’s improbable joy after adopting two kittens. “I am really hypnotized,” he said of them. But his feelings changed and his mood was darker the next time Avishai spoke with him. “I had to return my dear two kittens,” Roth told him. “I fear I have become dependent.” Roth often struggled with depression and physical ailments but his friends described a contented man over the last few years, after he shocked the literary world by revealing that his 2010 novel “Nemesis” would be his last book. Retirement did not leave him helpless, but liberated. He read, swam, walked, socialized and referred to his post-publication years as a welcome return to the rebellious but loving son he had been when growing up in Newark, New Jersey. “I am home,” he liked to tell friends. “I won.” His health rapidly failed in 2018 and he spent his final weeks in the hospital, a farewell poignant and comical. Various ex-girlfriends looked in on him. Manea, just three years younger than Roth, recalled that he and his friend competed over who had more stent procedures. Pierpont remembered Roth looking around his hospital room and expressing relief that he didn’t have to write about it. Even the nearness of death, what the longtime atheist called “the enemy,” did not throw him. “I have been to see the great enemy and walked around him and talked to him,” he told the writer Ben Taylor. “And he is not to be feared. I promise.” NVG RELATED STORIES: Seminal American novelist Philip Roth dead at 85 Was Philip Roth misogynist? His death reopens debate  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018

Bangkok an enduring street food hub,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/305521/bangkok-enduring-street-food-hub/,"06:56 PM September 09, 2018","BANGKOK — Street food has long been popular among foreign visitors and locals alike in many Asian cities, with Bangkok being one of the leading capitals endowed with such a powerful magnet. Meanwhile, Singapore is seeking to register its hawker-centers as an intangible cultural heritage with Unesco, a move that has sparked regional controversy, especially with neighboring Malaysia whose cuisine is quite similar to that of the island republic. However, unlike Singapore’s hawker centers, the street-food scene in Bangkok and other big cities in Thailand is probably more diverse, with characteristics that are not found anywhere else. These qualities have made Bangkok one of the world’s top street-food cities based on recent international tourist and related surveys. More recently, Jae Fai, a Bangkok street-food vendor, earned a Michelin star for her dish of omelette stuffed with crab meat, while the Tourism Authority of Thailand is launching a new campaign called “Amazing Thai Taste to the World” to boost the popularity of Mussaman curry. Other Thai foods better known outside the country include Tom Yum Koong and Phad Thai. As for Jae Fai, Thai Airways International said it was looking at giving the famous street-food queen an opportunity to prepare a special menu for airline customers. As one of the world’s top-10 tourist destinations, Thai food – be it on the streets or in street-side eateries – certainly plays a big role in attracting foreign visitors, in addition to natural tourist attractions, shopping etc. According to the latest statistics from World Tourism Organisation (WTO), Thailand’s annual foreign tourist arrivals have topped 35 million, ranking it as the world’s 10th most popular destination in 2017. In Asia, China was the only country that registered more foreign tourist arrivals totaling 60 million. In terms of tourism revenue, Thailand is ranked as the world’s fourth after the United States, Spain and France with total revenues of US$57.5 billion (Bt1.8 trillion) in 2017, according to WTO. Weerasak Kowsurat, the Tourism and Sports minister, said Thailand supports efforts to preserve all cultural heritage, including street food, but the country’s current focus is on hygiene as well as food waste management. In terms of environmental responsibility, the minister said the authorities have for the first time imposed a ban on the use of plastic bags and styrofoam containers in public zoos and national marine parks around the country. The move has been welcomed by most local and foreign visitors. Another example is the wider use of Pintou, a traditional metal tiffin carrier, among locals and foreign visitors in a bid to reduce dependence on plastic bags and other disposable food containers. According to the minister, some provincial restaurants have also started offering straws made of bamboo or water lily, instead of plastic straws, which are environmentally harmful. Based on a recent survey of tourists, 97 percent of respondents said they were willing to follow the initiatives to reform tourist-destination management with a focus on using tourism as a means to address income disparities in rural communities. “We seem to agree that the head counts of foreign tourists or their expenditure are not the top priority. So, targets like 36 million visitors this year are no longer important, but it is more crucial to focus on the GSTC [global sustainable tourism council] index for further development. “This mean we will pay more attention to fairness, safety standards, universal design or tourism for all, community benefits, not just the so-called community-based tourism notion. More specifically, we aim to attract more family groups, athletes, women, elderly, MICE [meetings, incentives, conference and exhibitions] travelers, trekkers, fishermen, bikers, health travelers, bird watchers etc. We want to introduce them to some less popular areas and towns,” he said.

Animal rights march goes beyond cats and dogs,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/305458/p2fb-animal-rights-march-goes-beyond-cats-dogs/,"04:51 PM September 09, 2018","One animal rights protest in Manila took a stand not just for cats and dogs, but also for the animals that put food on our table, among others. Last Aug. 25, about 300 individuals participated in the first Official Animal Rights March, a movement that began in London and has since been staged in over two dozen cities around the world. The march aimed to unite vegans in fighting for animal liberation — the movement which asserts that animals deserve rights and freedom. Being vegan is best known as a diet free of meat and animal products, including eggs and dairy. For others, it is a way of life which shuns animal cruelty and exploitation. This means adopting a plant-based diet and using clothing and other products that do not use animals. Beginning at the Bonifacio Shrine at 1:30 p.m., the group walked along Taft Avenue and ended in Quirino Grandstand. One of the stops was at Manila Ocean Park where the group stood outside to protest against the use of animals for entertainment. “End speciesism. Go vegan,” large white letters read over a long black banner that fronted the march. “Speciesism” is a term popularized by “Animal Liberation” author Peter Singer, which he defined as prejudice for one’s own species over others. The protest in Manila was organized by three friends: Jofer Santos, Cacai Buenviaje and Gilbert Santos. The three are not connected to any animal rights organizations; simply put, they are just animal lovers. Santos told INQUIRER.net in an exclusive interview that they reached out to Surge, the organization behind the annual London march, last August 2017 to plan their own protest in Manila, and were given approval. “The march was mainly held for all animals, not just dogs and cats,” said Santos. He explained that they were fighting against various industries that use animals whether for food, entertainment or experimentation. “The main point of the march was to put an end to all animal oppression.” “What motivated myself and fellow activists was mainly the animals and what they go through every single day. We realized we should do an event like this so people will realize and understand that animals have feelings just like us humans,” he said. From veganism to activism Santos, vocalist of metal band Ascend from Ruins, has been vegan since 2008. He was converted after watching videos on going vegan: “The funny part was I was eating meat at the time. I was eating chicken adobo and that was the last time I ate meat ever again.” Initially, he would talk about becoming vegan with friends and family, until he decided to take the next step to fight for animal rights: becoming an activist. “I realized being vegan wasn’t enough. The reason you become vegan is because you no longer support all forms of animal oppression,” he explained. “If I truly want a more peaceful world, if I truly want the vegan goal to be achievable, I have to do more.” That was back in 2014, and on his own, he took to the streets to hand out flyers about veganism. “I was all by myself. Back then, I was the only vegan I knew. I had vegan friends on Facebook but I only met them in 2015,” he said. Those friends he found in the Facebook group Manila Vegans whose members now number at 27,000-strong. Though being vegan in the country is slowly becoming easier — he notes that in Makati, more restaurants offer plant-based options — there is still a scarcity of animal activists. In his speech during the march, he urged fellow vegans to take action, highlighting that adopting the vegan lifestyle isn’t enough to end animal suffering. “It is important for us to get active so the industries that torture animals would feel our presence and the pressure we bring,” he appealed during the protest. Promoting veganism in a meat-loving country When asked how veganism can be promoted in a country whose diet is rich in meat, he said different approaches should be adopted. “We can put on the table the health issues, the environmental issues of eating meat,” he said. “In the Philippines, we are more interested in the health issues because we are more health-conscious.” Another point he emphasizes is that animals have feelings too. “They feel joy, they feel pain, they feel agony, they feel torment… humans are also animals so we are basically just like them. I think it’s really not hard to understand,” he explained. Can non-vegans join their animal rights activities? Yes, he says. He does encourage people to participate in any way they can to help animals such as doing rescue operations but still encourages them to go vegan. “While you save animals like dogs and cats, they consume pigs, cows, fish or any animals. It still doesn’t make sense,” he said. For those interested in becoming vegan, he recommended joining Facebook group Manila Vegans, which offers a one-month challenge and an online coach to guide you through the process. Santos also volunteers for Metro Manila Animal Save, a group which stops trucks that transport pigs and feed the animals with food and water before they are slaughtered. In London, 10,000 people marched; the protests began in 2016 with 2,500. The organizers of the Manila march aim for 1,000 participants next year. “You don’t have to be super good at speaking to people about veganism and animal rights for you to be considered an activist,” Santos said in his address during the march. “Always remember that if we choose to remain silent, their (the animals’) grief, pain, torment and suffering will never come to an end.” JB RELATED STORIES: Animal welfare advocates rescue pets, farm animals around Mayon Muntinlupa opens P9.3-M state-of-the-art animal pound to care for strays No meat or eggs —but not ‘vegan’?

Could good posture help you perform better at math?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/302371/p2fb-good-posture-help-perform-better-math/,"11:26 PM August 07, 2018","New United States research may have revealed a simple trick for boosting students’ test scores, finding that good posture while doing math could help make it easier. The study, by researchers at San Francisco State University, recruited 125 college students and tested them on how well they performed simple math while either slumped over or sitting up straight with good posture, shoulders back and relaxed. Before the test, the students were asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire asking them to rate their anxiety levels while taking exams and performing math. They were also asked to describe any physical symptoms of stress they experienced during the test. For the test, half the students sat in an erect position while the other half sat in a slouched position. They were then asked to mentally subtract 7 serially from 964 for 30 seconds before switching positions and repeating the math subtraction task, beginning at 834. The researchers found that the math test was rated by the students as being significantly more difficult while sitting slouched. At least 56 percent of the students reported that they found it easier to do the math in an upright position. Students who did not report anxiety about math did not report as great a benefit from a better posture, but they did find that doing math while slumped over was somewhat more difficult. “For people who are anxious about math, posture makes a giant difference,” said professor of health education Erik Peper. “The slumped-over position shuts them down and their brains do not work as well. They cannot think as clearly.” Co-author associate professor of health education Richard Harvey added that slumping over is a defensive posture, which can trigger old negative memories in the body and brain. The authors believe the results could help people prepare for other types of performances and tests, saying better posture could also help athletes, musicians and public speakers. “You have a choice,” said Peper. “It’s about using an empowered position to optimize your focus.” The results were published online in NeuroRegulation.

A rich history of healing,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/302299/rich-history-healing/,"04:25 PM August 07, 2018"," KUALA LUMPUR — Lovesickness is no laughing matter; Persian polymath Avicenna (also known as Ibn Sina) considered it a mental illness, a point noted in the illustrated compendium of The Wonders Of Creation And The Oddities Of Existence.  This is one of the many exhibits currently on display at the Al-Tibb: Healing Traditions In Islamic Medical Manuscripts show at the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia (IAMM) in Kuala Lumpur.  There are many others that await in this space, providing a glimpse into the medical knowledge and practices of old.  “Among the rarest manuscripts in this exhibition is Ibn Sina’s Book of Healing (Kitab al-Shifa), which is a voluminous scientific and philosophical encyclopedia containing a few small diagrams of cranial sutures, a fine example of early anatomical illustrations in the Islamic world. Another one I would like to highlight is the Kitab Tibb Melayu (Malay Book Of Medicine), where yaws, a tropical infection of the skin, bones and joints, is outlined in detail,” says Siti Marina Maidin, curator of the exhibition.  Al-Tibb is a medical exhibition of sorts, one that presents manuscripts from as far back to the 14th century to the late 19th century.  Among the diseases and ailments discussed in these written works are cancer, chicken pox, colic, epilepsy, measles, rabies, scrofula, typhoid and worm infections.  “My teammate, Muhammad Syukri Shairi and I worked closely with our Head of Curator, Dr Heba Nayel Barakat and others in the curatorial department, the conservators, graphic department, education department, gallery designer and display unit to come up with this exhibition,” reveals Marina of the show that was three years in the making.  At Al-Tibb, the earliest manuscript on display is the Complete Book Of The Medical Art (Kitab Kamil al-Sina’ah al-Tibbiyah), also known as Haly Abbas, which was completed in 1303 and also referred to as The Royal Book as it was dedicated to ‘Adud al-Dawlah Fana Khusraw, the ruler of Persia from 949 to 983.  “During the Islamic Medieval ages, art and science were highly valued by the rulers or caliphs who were also the patrons of hospitals and these medical literature. So it is not a surprise that some of the medical treatises were composed for the rulers, and in such cases, mostly by chief physicians,” explains Marina.  She hopes that the exhibition will impress upon visitors that there was healthy knowledge movement under the patronage of the caliphs with the involvement of diverse physicians and scholars from different ethnic and religious backgrounds, who contributed to the advancement of medicine.  “Medicine is a very progressive field and people are always fascinated with new medical discoveries. Unfortunately, many are not aware of the historical side of medicine which highlights the importance of humanity. That is one of our exhibition objectives; to educate our visitors on the medical humanities.  We hope that it will instill an interest to learn more about the history of medicine and initiate a discussion of medical traditions in their own culture,” she says.  Marina adds that the contribution of medical thoughts by Muslim scholars, including Father of Modern Medicine Ibn Sina, Al-Razi the Clinician and Ibn al-Nafis with his discovery of pulmonary circulation, shook Galenic medical thought.  “This later revolutionized the birth of modern medicine as their works were referred to in European medical schools. What we see today in medical practices is the continuation of similar concepts that has been preserved during the Islamic medieval ages,” she says.Marina highlights that there are lots of studies on the use of natural products in drug development, in Malaysia and beyond our shores. Cat’s whiskers plant for breast cancer, or snakehead fish extract for wound healing, anyone?  “The wealth of plants, herbs, animal and minerals preserved in the Islamic materia medica has opened up many possibilities in creating new types of drugs, or even supplements. For instance, the tubular treatise, Book of Simple Medicine (Tibb al-Adwiyah) contains a list of animal, plants and mineral in alphabetical order, and provides both substitute and antidote in the case of adverse reactions to these substances. We should dig deeper in these manuscripts to uncover the ancient knowledge our forefathers had,” muses Marina.  Al-Tibb has other points of interest, including old illustrations of the human anatomy, which are aesthetically a far cry from the textbook anatomy drawings we are familiar with today. Overall, this is really a showcase that combines elaborate medical works by prominent physicians, philosophers and scientists of the Islamic world, with artifacts that are both functional and artistic. As such, objects such as the rosewater sprinkler, water filter, medicine spoon and abarello (a medicinal jar to hold ointments or dry drugs) complement the medical treatises on display. All exhibits are from the collection of the IAMM and most are shown for the first time to the public.  “With Al-Tibb, we hope to project a glimpse of the medical evolution from the practice of humoral theory to the innovations in chemical medicine and the arrival of modern medicine – a story of one of mankind’s greatest intellectual pursuits,” she says.  Modern medicine or not, it is irrefutable that some things, like the search for a cure for lovesickness, is as elusive as it was in ancient times as it is now.  Al-Tibb: Healing Traditions In Islamic Medical Manuscripts is on at the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia (IAMM), Jalan Lembah, Perdana Botanical Gardens in Kuala Lumpur till Dec 31.

"Put down your phone if you want your brain to reap the benefits of nature, says study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/300859/p2fb-put-phone-want-brain-reap-benefits-nature-says-study/,"12:44 PM July 22, 2018","Being in nature can give a boost to your brain power, but only if you put away your phone and laptop, suggests a new United States study. Previous research has shown that being in natural surroundings can help the brain recover from mental fatigue and restore its ability to focus attention on a task. However, researchers from the University of Illinois and the University of Hong Kong, China, wanted to investigate whether using electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops would counteract the restorative effect of nature on the brain’s attention capacity if they were used while resting in green spaces. “Paying attention is necessary for every single thing we care about accomplishing: planning, carrying out plans, evaluating, learning, problem-solving and social relationships,” explained study co-author William Sullivan. However, the ability to pay attention is fatiguing, particularly in a world where we are surrounded by digital technology, as overuse of portable electronic devices can deplete attention capacity. “After a while, it’s really hard to focus and pay attention,” added Sullivan. For the study, the team recruited 81 participants and randomly assigned them to four groups: those resting in a green setting with or without a laptop and those resting in a barren setting with views of parking lots, walls or buildings with or without a laptop. All of the participants were asked to complete attention tests before performing 10 minutes of cognitive activities involving proofreading and subtraction. They then completed a second attention test before being allowed a 15-minute break. During this break the participants who had been given laptops were told they could use them for leisure activities such as looking at social media, news sites, YouTube, online games, online shopping or email unrelated to work, though not for anything related to work. After the break, the participants took another attention test. The results showed that only the participants who had rested in a green space without a laptop showed a significant improvement in their scores on the final attention test. For those in the other groups, using an electronic device in green settings substantially counteracted the attention benefits of green spaces, with the team commenting that for these participants, “a 15-minute break was the equivalent of no break at all.” “The space conveys no benefits if your head is in your device,” commented Sullivan. The team concluded that “It is not enough to go to a green space. You have to put aside your electronic devices in that space.” The findings were published in the journal Environment and Behavior.

Could just the smell of coffee be enough to give your brain power boost?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/300645/p2fb-just-smell-coffee-enough-give-brain-power-boost/,"10:14 PM July 19, 2018","Often touted for its many health benefits, new research suggests you might not even need to drink coffee to reap some of its rewards, with a United States study finding that just the scent of a cup of joe could help give people a cognitive boost that improves performance on certain tasks. Led by the Stevens School of Business along with researchers at Temple University and Baruch College, the team carried out two studies to investigate whether the scent of coffee alone, which has no caffeine, could be strong enough to boost cognitive performance. In the first study, the researchers looked at performance Graduate Management Aptitude Test, or GMAT, a computer adaptive test required by many business schools. They gave a 10-question GMAT algebra test to around 100 undergraduate business students in a computer lab setting, and divided the participants into two groups. One group took the test in the presence of an ambient coffee-like scent, while a control group took the same test in an unscented room. The researchers found that the group in the coffee-smelling room scored significantly higher on the test. To investigate further, and find out whether it was the coffee scent which increase alertness and subsequently improved performance, the team designed a follow-up survey which they gave to more than 200 new participants. The group were surveyed on their beliefs about various scents and their perceived effects on human performance, with the participants reporting that they they believed they would feel more alert and energetic when smelling a coffee scent, compared to a flower scent or no scent. They also said that exposure to coffee scent would increase their performance on mental tasks. The results suggest that smelling a coffee-like scent, despite having no caffeine in it, has a effect similar to drinking coffee in part due to the participants’ expectations, suggesting a placebo effect of coffee scent. “It’s not just that the coffee-like scent helped people perform better on analytical tasks, which was already interesting,” commented lead researcher and professor Adriana Madzharov. “But they also thought they would do better, and we demonstrated that this expectation was at least partly responsible for their improved performance.” Madzharov is now looking to explore whether coffee scents could have a similar placebo effect on other types of performance, such as verbal reasoning. Coffee has previously been found to also have many physical health benefits, including a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes and dementia, with some also suggesting that it may even help us live longer. The results can be found published online in the Journal of Environmental Psychology.

Poland’s double-edged vodka tradition,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/300241/polands-double-edged-vodka-tradition/,"05:53 PM July 15, 2018","Be it a source of national pride or negative stereotypes, vodka is an integral part of Polish identity. The country has just turned a former distillery into a museum celebrating its long vodka tradition but the location in a Warsaw neighbourhood once known for thieves and drunkards also recalls the downside of the national tipple. “It’s part of our DNA, our history, our heritage and our tradition,” says Andrzej Szumowski, president of the Polish Vodka Association, which co-sponsored the new museum, the first of its kind in Poland. “Just like there’s no French history without cognac or champagne, no British history without gin or Scotch whiskey or no Mexican history without tequila, you can’t talk about Polish history without mentioning vodka.” That history includes the French expression “drunk as a Pole”, which today is derogatory but originally had the opposite meaning when Napoleon allegedly first used it with his soldiers. It was his way of saying, “You can drink but you must know how to be drunk like Poles who, even when inebriated, are able to get up and fight,” according to Szumowski. Noble monopoly Poland was a kingdom of beer and mead before vodka appeared in the 15th century and upended drinking habits. The landed gentry began assigning an ever-increasing percentage of the wheat harvest to the production of spirits. According to the monopoly that only completely disappeared just before the 19th century, the nobles had the exclusive right to import, produce and sell alcohol on their properties. They even had the right to require their serfs to purchase a certain amount of alcohol. Named after “woda”, Polish for “water”, vodka has also served as bartering currency during times of scarcity, of which there have been many over the course of Poland’s troubled history. After World War I, the state liquor monopoly accounted for 10 percent of the state’s budget and even up to 15 percent after the end of World War II, according to Poland’s edition of Forbes. Poland currently produces the equivalent of nearly 100 million litres of pure alcohol each year, according to the national spirits industry association ZPPPS. That puts it among the world’s top producers along with the United States, Ukraine and Russia. King of consumption “Unfortunately, though, above all we’re exceptional at consuming alcohol,” says Krzysztof Brzoska, who heads the PARPA state agency for the prevention of alcohol-related problems. “Almost all of the alcohol produced here ends up on the domestic market,” he adds, saying that Poles are drinking more and more. The current favorite is beer. While neighbouring Lithuania consumes the most alcohol per capita each year in Europe, Poles lead the way when it comes to the amount consumed at one time. “We drink less often than the French or Italians, but when we do drink we go the whole way,” says Brzoska, adding that around 1,500 Poles die of an alcohol overdose each year. In the country of 38 million people, more than 800,000 are alcohol dependent, according to Dariusz Wasilewski, a psychiatrist specializing in drinking problems. But he adds that the number of Poles whose drinking habits are detrimental to their health is three or four times higher. “I just can’t accept the idea that an alcoholic beverage could be the object of national pride,” he tells AFP. Art of vodka For Tadeusz Dorda, marketing head of the Chopin brand, there is an art to drinking vodka: “We want it to be talked about in a smart way.” He wants it to be known for example that vodka does not need to be served ice cold. In fact, some connoisseurs say that the mark of a vodka’s quality is whether it is drinkable at a temperature of between six to eight degrees Celsius (43 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit). That is when it is possible to detect the vodka’s particular taste and fragrance, which depend on its main ingredient, as well as where and when it was made, according to Dorda. Potato-based vodka has a heavy quality, while the rye kind is lighter and is also known for its bitter taste and strong fragrance. Wheat-based vodka offers the mildest flavor. NVG RELATED STORIES: Polish Vodka Museum opens in Warsaw next week Valuable vodka bottle reported stolen found in Copenhagen  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.

Does swimming after eating cause stomach cramps? Experts debunk popular myths,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/299640/p2fb-swimming-eating-cause-stomach-cramps-experts-debunk-popular-myths/,"07:42 PM July 08, 2018","It’s important to take extra care with certain aspects of our health and well-being, such as avoiding too much sun and making sure to drink enough fluids. To help keep you informed on some of the best ways to stay to safe in the sun, here experts debunk some popular summer health myths and offer their advice on how to look after yourself and the whole family this summer. False: Saltwater helps wounds heal “This is a myth because saltwater from the beach can actually contain germs or bacteria that can infect an open wound,” says Baylor College of Medicine expert Isabel Valdez, a physician assistant and instructor of family and community medicine. “You should wait until the wound is healed and sealed completely before submerging it in fresh or saltwater.” To help the healing process, Valdez recommends washing the wound with warm, soapy water. If the wound becomes red, sore or warm to touch, then you should see your doctor. True (to a certain extent): You can get stomach cramps if you go swimming too soon after eating If you go swimming, or do any vigorous activities too soon after you eat, then there is a small chance that yes, you can get cramps, says Valdez. However, although swimming on a full stomach can cause discomfort, it is not life-threatening. Just allow some time to digest your food. False: You do not have to wear sunscreen when it is cloudy “You definitely want to wear sunscreen even when it’s cloudy because you are still going to be exposed to some UV rays,” Valdez said. “I recommend always wearing an SPF over 30.” Remember to reapply throughout the day, adds Valdez, especially if you are swimming or sweating. False: Kids need less sleep in summer It might be light outside, and the kids are probably begging to stay up later as a result, but children still need the same amount of sleep in summer as the rest of the year, says Blake Jones from Purdue University. “School is out and children want to stay up later, especially to play outside, but it’s crucial to keep them on a regular sleep schedule,” says Jones, an assistant professor of human development and family studies. “Summer also is often a time when many kids gain weight. There are several potential reasons, such as staying up later while eating fatty, salty, and sugary foods; increasing screen time and sedentary behaviors for some kids; and changing sleep patterns by disrupting sleep and sleeping less in general.” False: All drinks will help you stay hydrated “While you are out at the beach or hanging by the pool, the best way to hydrate yourself is to simply drink water,” says Valdez. A cold soda or beer can feel refreshing in hot summer temperatures but they are not going to hydrate you. In fact too much alcohol and caffeine can actually cause dehydration, as they are diuretics which can cause your body to lose fluids.

One-third of Australians getting sick from everyday chemicals,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/299155/one-third-australians-getting-sick-everyday-chemicals/,"05:57 PM July 03, 2018","New Australian research had found that nearly one in five of the country’s adults report chemical sensitivity, and more than one third have been medically diagnosed with Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS), which can cause a variety of health problems for sufferers when exposed to common chemical products. Carried out by Anne Steinemann, Professor of Civil Engineering and Chair of Sustainable Cities at the University of Melbourne, the study recruited 1,098 Australian adults age 18 to 65 and asked them to complete an online survey to assess the prevalence of MCS. The responses showed that 18.9 percent of participants suffered from chemical sensitivity, which is being unusually sensitive to everyday chemicals and chemically formulated products, and 6.5 percent reported medically diagnosed MCS, suggesting that the conditions are widespread in Australia, with MCS affecting an estimated 1 million adult Australians and chemical sensitivity affecting another 2 million. Among those with MCS, 74.6 percent also had diagnosed asthma or an asthma-like condition, and 91.5% had fragrance sensitivity, reporting health problems such as migraine headaches when exposed to fragranced consumer products including air fresheners, deodorizers, laundry products, candles, cleaning supplies, and personal care products. In addition, MCS also affected participants’ ability to work, with 77.5 percent of those with the condition reporting that they are prevented from going to certain places because of fragranced products; 52.1 percent lost workdays or a job in the past year due to their exposure to fragranced products in the workplace, and 55.4 reported that the health effects caused by MCS are potentially disabling. “Multiple Chemical Sensitivities is a serious disease that is often caused and worsened by exposure to petrochemical sources such as pesticides, solvents, new building materials and fragranced items,” said Professor Steinemann, who is an international expert on environmental pollutants, air quality and their effects on health. “Even low-level exposure can inflict a range of adverse health effects such as migraines, breathing difficulties, cognitive impairment, seizures and asthma attacks.” A previous study by Professor Steinemann also found that in the United States one in four Americans suffer from chemical sensitivity, and 12.8 percent have been diagnosed with MCS. “While Australia is not yet at the same levels as the US, it appears we’re on the same pollution path,” Professor Steinemann said. To try to prevent any negative health issues Professor Steinemann recommends choosing products without any fragrance. She also believes that workplaces, healthcare facilities, schools and other indoor environments should implement fragrance-free policies. “The products that are problematic for people with MCS are also major sources of air pollutants. Reducing your use and exposure to these products benefits not only your own and other people’s health, but also the environment,” she said. The results can be found published online in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports. MKH RELATED STORIES: Australia approves music festival pill-testing trial US OKs first prescription drug made from marijuana  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
World’s top chef Ferran Adria doesn’t want to go back into the kitchen,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/298905/worlds-top-chef-ferran-adria-doesnt-want-go-back-kitchen/,"04:52 PM June 30, 2018","Ferran Adria—”the most influential chef in the world”—is a man on a mission. Just not one that involves him having to run a restaurant. The Catalan—whose elBulli restaurant was named the best on the planet a record five times—is out to prove that the wildly experimental dishes he pioneered there still cut the mustard. In the seven years since he unexpectedly shut the legendary Costa Brava restaurant, with 3,000 people still on the waiting list for a table, simpler more earthy cooking has come into vogue. But the father of molecular cuisine, who brought the world the idea of “mandarin air”, eating smoke, caramelized quails, trout egg tempura and any number of foams and emulsions, told AFP that he has not stood still. “I have not stopped working nor experimenting,” he said, since he shuttered elBulli, which held the maximum three Michelin stars. Back then Adria admitted that he was feeling a little jaded. But as he explains in a new 15-part documentary series about his incredible rise from dishwasher to culinary superstar, “elBulli: Story of a Dream”, which begins on Amazon Prime on Monday, he has well and truly got his mojo back. It is just that he doesn’t want to go back to cooking on the stove day and night. Famous chefs don’t cook “It makes no sense for me to open a restaurant,” he told AFP. “Why would I do that? “Almost all the greatest chefs in the world—with a few exceptions—no longer actually cook. They taste, direct and conceive,” he said. Adria has, however, helped his brother Albert to open six establishments in Barcelona, of which one, Enigma, he described as a “baby elBulli”. It came 95th in the latest “50 Best” world restaurants list. Instead, he teaches at Harvard University, gives advice, and runs the elBulli foundation, funded by 12 million euros of private capital from the Spanish giants Telefonica and CaixaBank and the Italian coffee company Lavazza. A natural enthusiast every bit as whimsical and surprising in the flesh as his cooking, Adria is more concerned about bringing on the next generation of master chefs. He had a big hand in forming the trio of talents who have replaced him at the top of the global gastronomic tree: fellow Catalan Joan Roca (of El Celler de Can Roca in Girona), Italian Massimo Bottura (of Osteria Francescana in Modena) and the Dane Rene Redzepi of Noma fame. “I’d say 95 percent of the restaurants I have helped have been successful,” he added, acknowledging that he has worked with the Spanish chef Jose Andres of the Minibar in Washington DC, which has two Michelin stars. ‘Techno-emotional cooking’ Adria—who is still only 56—is also working on a gastronomic innovation center on the site of the old elBulli at Cala Montjoi, which is due to open five years behind schedule next year. Rather than a molecular cuisine, he prefers to call his cooking “techno-emotional.” “They say that I am out of fashion, that no one makes ‘espumas’ anymore (his light-as-air mousses). But thousands of restaurants across the world now use siphons,” said the “alchemist” The Guardian once called “the most imaginative generator of haute cuisine on the planet.” He said his mission at elBulli’s was to discover “the limits of the gastronomic experience”. In 17 years there he created 1,846 recipes, including a “crispy liquid”, a mousse of white beans and sea urchins and powdered foie gras. Adria said he hopes the new Amazon series—based on a previous television series about his work—will help demolish some of the myths about elBulli, which sparked controversy because of its use of chemical additives. “Salt is a lot worse for the health than any stabilizer,” he hit back. Another of his new passions is a project he calls his “Bullipedia”, an enormous gastronomic encyclopedia for which the autodidact has plunged himself into studying 400 years of French cuisine. “It is one of my big sources of inspiration” at the moment, with Chinese, Mexican, Peruvian and Japanese cooking. While the British and American press like to see Adria as a symbol of the new hegemony of Spanish haute cuisine over the French, he told AFP that he was a “child of French nouvelle cuisine”, citing Michel Guerard, the Troisgros clan, Paul Bocuse and Alain Chapel as his main influences. MKH RELATED STORIES: Dropout to Michelin stars: The rise of chef Ken Chan in Taiwan Homeless Lebanese dishwasher becomes Michelin-starred chef  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.

Like an emergency room—minus the hassle,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/298663/like-emergency-room-minus-hassle/,"03:40 PM June 27, 2018","One morning, a man woke up to unbearable pain in his abdomen. He managed to drive himself to the hospital, where doctors requested for an ultrasound. The catch? The results could only be released several days later. Then he remembered a friend mention Centre Médicale Internationale (CMI), a multispecialty outpatient clinic in Bonifacio Global City. A walk-in patient, he was received by care specialists who took his information and vitals before he underwent an ultrasound. In less than an hour, the result was out: The man had a huge gallstone. Surgery could wait, he told himself and went home to rest. But the pain only worsened, so he called CMI who advised him to go to the nearest hospital. There, he was met and operated on by the hospital’s surgeon, who also happens to be among CMI’s stable of specialists. The following day, while recuperating from surgery in his room, the man received a fruit basket from CMI. He recognized that if it were not for the timely intervention of CMI’s medical staff, his case would have become more complicated. CMI was also where an expat family relocating to Africa dropped by for their complete immunization shots, and where a foreign national received an ultrasound-guided nerve block injection on her back, a treatment that got her dancing soon after. Urgent care vs emergency medicine Stories like these illustrate CMI’s strength as an urgent care center, a relatively unheard of concept among Filipinos who tend to take their health woes to the emergency room (ER) of a hospital. “Urgent care is different from emergency medicine,” says Dr. Hazel Zuellig, CMI board director and a practicing neurologist. “Emergency medicine refers to what’s critical—stroke, heart attack, stab wounds—and for that you go to the ER. Urgent care is relative. You could be preparing to leave for a flight tomorrow when suddenly you’re not feeling well. Can you proceed with the trip? What medicines do you need? Will they stop you at the airport because you have a fever? These concerns are urgent. They’re not critical or life-threatening, but they’re urgent to you.” To this day, people consider the ER the place to go for health issues of this nature. It’s certainly a quicker route than seeing a doctor: You don’t need to make an appointment and you’ll get the diagnostic tests you need. “But you still have to wait about 4-5 hours, and you’re put with patients with more serious cases; someone being resuscitated, another bloodied from trauma,” says Zuellig. “Generally, the experience in the ER is stressful, and if you’re a mother with a child who has an upset stomach or are accompanying an elderly parent who needs an X-ray because of a bad fall, you’d wish there was some place you could go that is less stressful and could attend to your needs.” Launched last year, CMI branded itself as “the healthcare equivalent of a Swiss private bank.” Company presidents and CEOs were the target of the facility that specialized in concierge medicine—thorough, personalized and private medical care in a luxurious setting of clean, white interiors with touches of green and floor-to-ceiling glass windows that bring in natural sunlight and views of lush trees. Interestingly, it was these first clients who were instrumental in leading CMI to focus on urgent care. Impressed by the services and efficiency of the center, they would come back with their families. “A mom could be in the middle of a board meeting when she finds out that her son was sent home from school because he has a fever. If she takes him to the ER, the rest of her day is over. In CMI, we have doctors on duty and we have 150 doctors from 40 different specialties on call,” says Zuellig. “So in a way we’re operating like an emergency room, minus the hassle.” Operating like an emergency room, however, doesn’t mean the center charges like one. “Our rate is less than an ER consult,” says Zuellig. Family physician Through CMI, Zuellig also hopes to bring back the concept of the family physician, a dedicated primary care physician who knows each member’s medical history and can address health issues as they arise. “You want to have a doctor you can call to consult for issues like blood pressure, fever, or a cough or cold, and who could refer you to the appropriate specialists when necessary,” she says. Patients can choose from a roster of doctors—from cardiologists, neurologists and oncologists to highly specialized pediatric gastroenterologists, chronic pain specialists, psychiatrists, and counselors. CMI also boasts the latest medical equipment for diagnostic laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging, ear-nose-and-throat concerns, obstetrics and gynecology, rehabilitation medicine, neurology, cardiology, ophthalmology and dentistry. A complete healthcare solution, CMI even offers personalized health programs and Executive Wellness and Preventive Medicine packages. Regulars of CMI will tell you that the center still maintains its concierge medicine approach. Appointments with a doctor are made based on a patient’s availability. When a patient arrives, he’s received by cordial care specialists and given his choice of snacks while waiting for a doctor or his test results. Results can be delivered directly to a patient or accessed via password-protected e-mail. “It feels like home for them,” says Zuellig of the center. Indeed, CMI’s bright and welcoming atmosphere is a breath of fresh air to a 22-year-old girl undergoing chemotherapy for an advanced form of cancer, or a woman in her 90s who drops by the center once a week for an hour of physical therapy. Call it healing with a heart. For Zuellig, the urgent care center is a game changer. “In our market research, we found out that 85 percent of the people we surveyed want convenience in their choice of health clinic,” she said in an interview on ANC’s “Early Edition.” “With the traffic and all our activities, sometimes we tend to neglect our medical care because it just doesn’t fit in our schedule. “CMI conforms to your schedule,” she said. “This is healthcare when you need it.” Centre Médicale Internationale is at 2/F, Ore Central Bldg., 31st corner 9th Ave., Bonifacio Global City, Taguig.

"No link found between exposure to air pollution in pregnancy and ADHD, says study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/298625/no-link-found-exposure-air-pollution-pregnancy-adhd-says-study/,"09:06 PM June 26, 2018","A new large-scale European study suggests that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy may not be linked to an increased risk of attention-deficit and hyperactivity symptoms in children. Led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), the study looked at data from 29,127 children between the ages of 3 and 10 living in Germany, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain. The researchers estimated the mothers’ exposures to nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) throughout pregnancy at their home address and assessed the children’s ADHD symptoms using questionnaires completed by parents and/or teachers. The team classified a total of 2,801 children as having ADHD symptoms within the borderline/clinical range and 1,590 within the clinical range. However, they found no evidence of a link between exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and a higher risk of ADHD symptoms within either the borderline or clinical range. Although previous research has suggested that prenatal exposure to air pollution may affect brain development and increase attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children, the findings so far have been inconsistent. “Given the conclusions of this study and the inconsistent findings of previous studies, we hypothesize that exposure to air pollution might not increase the risk of ADHD in children in the general population,” said ISGlobal researcher Mònica Guxens, who coordinated the study. “However, we believe that exposure to air pollution could have harmful effects on neuropsychological development, especially in genetically susceptible children.” With a worldwide prevalence of 5 percent, ADHD is the most common childhood behavioral disorder. Symptoms include inattention, hyperactivity and/or impulsivity which can interfere with a child’s development and academic performance. It has previously been shown that ADHD is the result of complex interactions between genetic background, as heritability is approximately 75 percent, and environmental and factors. The results can be found published online in the journal Epidemiology.

Puyat—a self-confessed food aficionado—and her team personally curated 40 local food exhibitors for this gastronomic food fair. “Food is my first love, and first love never dies… The best way to promote the country is through food, and the best way to understand a culture is via food,” Puyat told the Inquirer. “Whenever you go to a place you don’t only want to see the sights but you also want to know, ‘Saan ba masarap dyan?’ Culinary tourism is part of promoting the country.” Philippine food has been getting international recognition, with the likes of Purple Yam in Brooklyn or Tito Rad’s Grill in Queens getting full feature writeups in the New York Times. Puyat said that when 2012 Veuve Clicquot awardee for World’s Best Female Chef Elena Arzak visited the country three years ago, she brought back to Spain some local pili nuts. Spain’s Joan Roca, one time best chef in the world, was blown away by our calamansi. “Everybody was surprised that I was still promoting food,” Puyat said. “How can I not? We have the best food. We have different kinds of lechon or pancit every place you go. That’s the way to attract people to go to places.” Aside from beaches, churches, cultural tourism, and heritage tourism, Puyat said she will also be actively promoting farm and food tourism. Farms across the Philippines are already getting DOT-accreditation for tourism, where tourists are not only given a peek into the everyday lives of farmers but get also to participate in harvesting, making fertilizers, etc. Puyat said her office will be pushing for alternative tourism, one that will promote eco-tourism and responsible tourists. “Everyone is fearful they will become another Boracay so they are now more conscious and they are policing themselves. They know the legal and environmental laws,” she said. “I’m a glass-half-full kind of person. Boracay opened our eyes–we need sustainable tourism.” “We are thankful to the DOT, and to Secretary Bernadette Romulo Puyat, for the continued trust in the SSI Group to be an avenue to promote farm tourism and indigenous Philippine products,” said SSI president Anton Huang. “Through your tutelage we have given local farmers and Pinoy ‘agripreneurs’ a channel to showcase the Philippines’ finest flavors and ingredients.” Here are our top finds at the fair: Down to Earth Grass-fed beef, free-range pork black heritage, grass-fed lamb, biodynamic vegetables grown on living soil sans chemicals or pesticides, grass-fed dairy, native free-range poultry—if you’re looking to get healthier, this is a good place to start. Located on the ground floor, with biodynamic farmer Nicolo Aberasturi manning the shop, Down to Earth is introducing dried hibiscus or labog, supposedly good for those with hypertension. www.downtoearth.ph, email [email protected] Saret Organic Farmville From its farm in Sta.

Vegan beauty is on the rise,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/296959/p2fb-vegan-beauty-rise/,"07:20 PM June 10, 2018","The vegan beauty movement is more than just a trend, according to a new report. Research by Grand View Research, Inc., has found that the global vegan cosmetics market looks set to reach $ 20.8 billion by the year 2025, a compound annual growth rate of 6.3 percent. This is partly due to an increase in demand driven by millennials. A growing appetite for cruelty-free beauty products, in addition to concerns regarding health and safety and an increasing importance placed on environmental issues, means that natural substitutes such as plant- and mineral-based ingredients are becoming increasingly popular within the industry, the report states. In the United States, the vegan cosmetics market is predicted to surpass a value of $3.16 billion by 2025. The past few years have seen a rise in popularity of vegan and cruelty-free beauty brands eschewing ingredients that come from or are tested on animals, with headline brands such as Kat Von D, Too Faced, Urban Decay and Fenty Beauty by Rihanna leading the way. Cult cosmetics brand Milk Makeup declared itself 100 percent vegan back in March, after eliminating animal-based products such as honey, beeswax and collagen from its formulas, while this week saw stationery company Crayola launch a vegan beauty line with Asos.

People who need to wear glasses likely to be more intelligent—study,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/295999/people-need-wear-glasses-likely-intelligent-study/,"04:41 PM May 31, 2018","If you’ve been called smart just because you wear glasses, chances are there is some truth to it. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh shared their findings from a major study that found correlations between general cognitive function and genetic data. Their findings are published in the journal Nature Communications. Cognitive function, also known as general intelligence, covers mental processes such as reasoning, memory and verbal fluency. The study involved 300,486 individuals between the ages of 16 and 102, whose intelligence was determined through cognitive tests. Their analysis found 709 genes “significantly associated” with intelligence, and that there was “significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function, reaction time, and many health variables including eyesight, hypertension, and longevity”. Those who had higher intelligence were 28 percent more likely to need a pair of glasses or contact lenses for their eyesight. No explanation was given as to why better cognitive function leads to poor eyesight. Incidentally, a Gutenberg Health Study published in 2014 found that being short-sighted was linked to finishing higher levels of education. However, being more intelligent bode well for other health issues, such as a lower chance of cardiovascular diseases (including heart attacks and chest pain), lung cancer and depression. It also reaffirmed previous studies that being more intelligent was connected to living longer. If you have naturally good eyesight, there’s no reason to feel threatened. For one, there is more than one way to be intelligent—for instance, more studies are emerging on emotional intelligence. More importantly, you don’t have to go through the hassle of wearing frames on your face or popping on contact lenses.  /ra  RELATED STORIES: Breastfeeding leads to higher IQ, earnings in adulthood—study Jack Ma says high EQ, not intelligence, is key to his billion-dollar success New eye drops could make glasses obsolete for people with sight problems  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
Kabul library bus drives Afghan children to read,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/295668/kabul-library-bus-drives-afghan-children-to-read/,"03:54 PM May 28, 2018","The door of the blue bus slides open and dozens of children excitedly bound up the steps, eager to get their hands on hard-to-find books in Kabul’s first mobile library. Named Charmaghz — the Dari for walnut, which is associated with logic in Afghanistan because the nut resembles a brain — the converted public bus is hard to miss as it winds through the dusty streets of the Afghan capital. The library-on-wheels offers pupils and street kids free access to children’s books, which are in short supply at public schools and libraries. It also offers one of the few spaces outside the home that children can use in a city where fear is increasingly keeping residents behind closed doors. As both the Taliban and the Islamic State group step up their attacks in Kabul, with civilians paying the price, many parents — traumatized by the violence, some of them already devastated by loss — have stopped taking their children out in public. Charmaghz, used by as many as 300 children every day, is a rare exception. The vehicle, which is rented from a state-owned bus company and takes precautions to avoid government buildings, main roads or other crowded areas targeted by militants in Kabul, is a relatively secure place for them to read, play chess and see friends. “Boys, you sit in the back and girls in the front. It is important to be organized,” one of three volunteers tells the children as he pulls books from an overhead shelf and places them in outstretched hands. Unlike traditional libraries where chatting is discouraged, the constant hum of voices fills Charmaghz. Children sit cross-legged on the carpeted floor or at desks reading aloud from some of the 600 books that have been donated by Afghan publishers. “I come to the bus once a week to read books,” 13-year-old Zahra told AFP. “Today I’m reading about how to improve your health. I’m reading what I should do and what I should eat.” “When I go home I share the stories I read here with my brothers and sisters.” Book shortage The library bus was launched in February by Oxford University graduate Freshta Karim, who has dedicated herself to improving the reading and storytelling abilities of children in Afghanistan — an opportunity she never had as a child. Karim grew up a refugee in Pakistan and returned to Afghanistan after the fall of Taliban in 2002. She completed her undergraduate degree in Kabul before winning a Chevening scholarship to study a master’s in public policy at Oxford. “When we were children we did not have access to… libraries for children,” Karim, 26, told AFP. “I remember as a kid at school we didn’t even have chairs — we were sitting on the floor to study.” The library bus stops at schools, parks or orphanages throughout the week, and is an “efficient” way to reach lots of children, Karim said, helping to improve Afghanistan’s low general rate of literacy of just 36 percent. Even now most public schools in Afghanistan do not have libraries, said Shafiullah, who used to work at Kabul’s main public library and now helps non-profit organizations publish children’s books. “Young people and children do not have access to different types of books except their school textbooks,” Shafiullah, who like many Afghans goes by one name, told AFP. “And there are only a few non-governmental organizations that sometimes help publish books for children.” The time many children spend at schools in Afghanistan is limited. Afghans receive an average of 4.6 years of formal education, according to a 2017 survey by the Asia Foundation. Broadening horizons Inside Charmaghz, 15-year-old Abbas reads to his friends the tragic story of Rostam, a hero in Persian mythology, and his son Sohrab. Abbas said the library bus had given him access to books he could not find at his school. “At school you have a limited choice. You don’t have a lot of books. But here you can find a whole range,” he told AFP. More than eight million children are enrolled in schools across Afghanistan this year, official figures show. But 3.5 million other school-age kids will miss out due to school closures, grinding conflict and poverty. Karim is realistic about the changes to literacy the mobile library can achieve in a country the size of Afghanistan. But it is a start, said Karim, who is hoping to garner enough donations to rent another two buses. “I don’t think a mobile library will solve the thousands of problems that we have in our education system,” she said. “But a mobile library is a small effort among a lot of efforts that we have to make.” CC RELATED STORIES: Blue bus of Kabul brings joys of reading to Afghan children Futuristic Tianjin Binhai library tricked book lovers and they’re not impressed!

"Exercising 4 to 5 days a week slows down heart aging, says new study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/295040/p2fb-exercising-4-5-days-week-slows-heart-aging-says-new-study/,"08:43 PM May 21, 2018","New United States research has suggested that to slow down heart aging, exercising four to five days a week for life is ideal. Carried out by researchers at the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, Dallas and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, the study set out to look at whether the recommended levels of exercise, which suggest four to five 30-minute workouts per week, are enough to slow down aging of the heart and blood vessels. The team looked at 102 participants over 60 years of age, who had consistently exercised throughout their life. Participants were categorized into groups depending on their lifelong exercise history, and how many exercise sessions of at least 30 minutes they did each week. Sedentary was defined as less than two exercise sessions per week; Casual Exercisers were those who did two to three exercise sessions per week; Committed Exercisers managed four to five exercise sessions per week (in line with current guidelines); and Masters Athletes completed six to seven exercise sessions per week. The team also gathered measures of each participant’s arterial stiffness. The results showed that those who had a lifelong history of casual exercise (two to three times a week) had more youthful middle-sized arteries, which supply oxygenated blood to the head and neck. However, those who met the current guidelines and exercised four to five times per week throughout their life not only had more youthful middle-sized arteries but also more youthful large central arteries, which provide blood to the chest and abdomen. While any form of exercise helps reduce the overall risk of death from heart problems, the new research suggests that the different sizes of arteries are affected differently by varying amounts of exercise, which could be important information for developing long-term exercise programmes. Benjamin Levine, one of the authors of the study, commented, “This work is really exciting because it enables us to develop exercise programmes to keep the heart youthful and even turn back time on older hearts and blood vessels.” “Previous work by our group has shown that waiting until 70 is too late to reverse a heart’s ageing, as it is difficult to change cardiovascular structure even with a year of training,” Levine explained. “Our current work is focusing on two years of training in middle aged men and women, with and without risk factors for heart diseases, to see if we can reverse the ageing of a heart and blood vessels by using the right amount of exercise at the right time.” The results were published in The Journal of Physiology.

"Long legs turn women’s heads, arm length immaterial, says study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/294484/p2fb-long-legs-turn-womens-heads-arm-length-immaterial-says-study/,"07:08 PM May 16, 2018","Labouring over the age-old question “What do women look for in men?” scientists added an item to the list Wednesday: legs slightly longer than average, with a good shin-to-thigh ratio. Long arms, however, fail to impress. In an online survey, some 800 American women preferred faceless male figures “when their legs are slightly longer than average,” but not too long, said study co-author Thomas Versluys of the University of Cambridge. The women, aged 19 to 76 from different racial groups, were asked to judge the attractiveness of computer-generated male silhouettes with slight differences in leg- and arm length. The respondents preferred legs that were just above the average length, but not too long. They also found figures most attractive “when the ratio between the lower and upper limb segment — shin and thigh — was average,” Versluys told AFP. However, “we also found that arm length has no effect on attractiveness.” In the study of sexual selection in humans, limb proportions are known to be an important determinant of attractiveness. The latest study is the most detailed investigation yet of how short is too short, and how long is too long, said the authors.  Long and the short of it The results suggest leg length played an important role in sexual selection and human evolution in the past, and has likely remained a subconscious preference in mate choice. “It is probably important because it’s a fairly reliable predictor of factors that are relevant in human evolution such as health, developmental trajectory, nutrition, and so forth,” explained Versluys. So why would arm length, thought to be important for activities such as spear throwing and fishing, be less important to women than the span of their legs? It could be that long legs are a better signal of good nutrition and health, said the researcher. Also, leg length is more obvious than arm length, and adds to a man’s overall height, also seen as a plus in competition for mates. “Taken together, our results add to the growing evidence that limb variation influences aspects of human well-being ranging from mate choice to employment prospects to medical outcomes…”, the research team wrote in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

Does wearing a face mask really protect against air pollution?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/293639/p2fb-wearing-face-mask-really-protect-air-pollution/,"08:28 PM May 07, 2018","Despite being a common sight in polluted cities, particularly those in Asia, new research suggests that face masks designed to filter out pollution particles may not be as effective as they claim to be. Carried out by an international team of researchers from Heriot-Watt and the Institute of Occupational Medicine in the United Kingdom, the study assessed the effectiveness of a selection of masks in Beijing. With estimates suggesting that air pollution causes 1.6 million premature deaths in China each year, the researchers also looked at the levels of air pollution in the capital and the potential effects on health. The team purchased nine masks to test. All nine claimed that they would protect wearers from inhaling fine particle pollution, which primarily comes from vehicle exhausts as well as fuel combustion and power plants. Also known as PM2.5, fine particulate matter are tiny particles suspended in the air measuring 2.5 micrometers or smaller, which, when inhaled, are deposited in the lungs. By comparison, a human hair is between 50 and 70 micrometers thick. The team first tested how effective each mask was at filtering pollution particles by drawing airborne diesel exhaust through a section of the mask’s material for 30 minutes and measuring the levels of particulate matter and black carbon on both sides. The masks were then tested on 10 volunteers who were exposed to diesel exhaust in a lab while performing everyday tasks such as talking, sitting, bending over and walking. The results showed that the masks varied significantly in their effectiveness, with the team finding that depending on the material used for the mask the average particle and carbon penetration ranged from 0.26 percent to 29 percent. The tests on the volunteers revealed even greater difference, with the team finding that the average leakage from the masks ranged from as low as three percent to as much as 68 percent while the participants performed sedentary tasks such as sitting. While performing active tasks the average leakage ranged from seven percent to 66 percent. “Only one mask had an average leakage below 10 percent on both active and sedentary tests,” added lead researcher John Professor Cherrie. Although retail masks must be certified to local or international standards the results suggest that the face masks currently found on the market may not provide adequate protection. Although little information is available on which product will offer the best protection, Professor Cherrie offers some advice: “If it’s important for you to protect yourself or your family with masks, choose the best one you can and look for one marketed to workplaces. Don’t opt for the cheapest option, choose the one that’s most likely to do the best job.” The results can be found published online in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine.

Lupus Awareness Month May 2018: Essential facts about the disease,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/293636/p2fb-lupus-awareness-month-may-2018-essential-facts-disease/,"07:53 PM May 07, 2018","This May marks Lupus Awareness Month in the United States, while May 10 is World Lupus Day. Both events aim to raise awareness of the disease, which affects celebrities including Toni Braxton, Seal and most recently and perhaps most famously, Selena Gomez. However, despite celebrities shining a light on the condition, the Lupus Foundation of America states that research has found that two-thirds of the public still knows little or nothing about lupus. Here we round up some facts and figures about lupus. What is lupus? Lupus is a chronic, autoimmune disease that triggers inflammation in any part of the body including skin, joints, and/or organs inside the body. Autoimmune diseases happen when the body’s immune system attacks its own healthy tissues, causing inflammation, pain, and damage. The most common type of lupus is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can affect joints, skin, brain, lungs, kidneys and blood vessels, and can cause widespread inflammation and tissue damage in the affected organs. There is no cure for lupus, but medical treatment and lifestyle changes can help control it. What are the symptoms of SLE? People with SLE may experience a variety of symptoms including fatigue, skin rashes, fevers and pain or swelling in the joints. Other symptoms include sun sensitivity, oral ulcers, arthritis, lung problems, heart problems, kidney problems, seizures, psychosis and blood cell and immunological abnormalities. SLE symptoms may affect women and men differently. Some adults may have experience a period of SLE symptoms, called flares. Some individuals experience flares frequently, and other may experience them years apart. What causes SLE? The causes are still unknown, but scientists believe the condition may be linked to environmental, genetic, and hormonal factors. Who is at risk from SLE? Lupus affects people of all ages, races, ethnicities, and genders all over the world. However, some groups of people do develop lupus more frequently than others. Women between age 15 to 44 years are at greatest risk of developing SLE, and women in general are at a far greater risk than men. Is SLE genetic? Most people with SLE do not have family members with the disease, however some do have a family history of the condition. Those who have an immediate family member with SLE have only a slightly higher risk for the disease. How is SLE diagnosed? If you think you might have SLE you need to visit your health care provider, who will make a diagnosis taking into account your symptoms and the results of a physical examination, X-rays and lab tests. However, SLE can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms can also look like symptoms of other diseases. How can SLE be treated? Patients will need to contact their health care provider to find out more about what is right for them, but often a team of experts are needed to treat SLE as it can involve treating a variety of organs. Often patients will take immunosuppressive drugs that inhibit activity of the immune system, most commonly hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids. People with SLE may also have other autoimmune conditions which also require treatment. For more information head to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

10 step-by-step tipid tips even you can do,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/293314/10-step-step-tipid-tips-even-you-can-do/,"06:13 PM May 04, 2018","“I’m going to start saving money from now on.” How many times have you made this promise to yourself, only to slip up after getting your salary for the month and splurging on that thing that you want but don’t actually need? Look—we get it. It’s hard to say no to the urge to spend, especially when it’s payday and you’ve got crisp bills burning a hole in your wallet. What often happens is that any attempt to be more thrifty is abandoned almost immediately, then followed by vague statements like “I’ll start saving next month” or “I’m young and I don’t really need to save yet” to assuage the guilt of not seeing it through. The problem is that, for most people, there is a constant battle between their “I don’t really need to buy this” and “treat yourself” mentality—and we all know which of the two is a lot easier to follow. Like all lifestyle changes, learning to become a wiser spender is a tough road to walk. You’re bound to make more than a few missteps or even completely fall off from the path, but committing to small yet certain steps will really move you forward. We made a ten-step guide to saving that can easily be accomplished and will actually help you save money in the long run if you see it through. Read it below: Step 1:  Assess your current finances  The first step in solving anything is always identifying the problem. You need to have a pretty solid grasp on your current situation in order to understand what needs to be fixed, so begin with an honest assessment of where you are right now in terms of money. How much are you making and spending every month? Ask yourself whether you can actually afford the kind of lifestyle you’re living based on what you’re currently earning. For some people, this is usually the root of the problem; some have this notion of #FeedGoals that they want to live up to and they end up sinking into debt for a couple hundred likes on social media. We all deserve to be able to travel the world and take vacations, of course, but not to the point of jeopardizing our day to day living. Step 2: Create a budget plan you can actually stick to Now that you’ve assessed your situation, it’s time to plan out a new routine that will help you achieve your goal. Creating a budget plan will help you map out your expenses every month, but make sure to create one that you can actually stick to. Some people tend to make extreme cuts to their current spending in order to get results as fast as possible, but this usually only leads to them becoming disheartened because of how difficult it is to accomplish. A good starting point would be following the 50/30/20 rule if you’ve never planned a budget before. According to this budget scheme, 50% of your salary should go to necessities (housing, food, transportation, utilities, etc.), 20% should go to your savings, and 30% can be used for your lifestyle choices (hobbies, eating out, vacations, etc.). Monthly payments for your existing debt should fall under the 50% bracket along with your day-to-day expenses while items like phone plans, media streaming subscriptions, and other things you don’t really need to get by should be considered lifestyle choices and not utilities. Step 3: Know where to best make cuts Using your new budget plan, figure out what items you’re spending on the most. This is important in order to know which cuts are going to have the most significant impact when you make them. For example, if majority of your salary goes to paying your monthly rent, finding a cheaper place to live or getting a roommate will help you save more money than cutting back on other things that don’t actually cause as much strain to your budget. Think of it this way: making cuts to the bigger items on your budget plan means you can keep the minor expenses you occasionally treat yourself to, like eating out and watching movies. Step 4:  Shop only for what you need  Now that you have a new budget plan, the next step is to make sure you don’t go overboard. Grocery shopping is usually where people end up splurging the most. To avoid overspending, make sure you always come to the store with a list of what you need. Limit your grocery trips to once or twice a month, too. Another advice people would often say is that you should never shop while hungry, because your mind makes you buy more food items when you have an empty stomach. And if you have kids, better leave them at home so they wouldn’t ask you to buy items they don’t really need and throw a fit about it if you refuse to give in. Step 5: Always look for the cost-effective alternative  When out shopping, always compare the prices of the brands before buying. While there are items that you should never scrimp on like medicine, there are other items where brands don’t differ that much when it comes to quality but differ greatly in price (professional salon shampoo and store shampoo, for example, are made of mostly the same ingredients and have nearly the same effect). You should also consider finding alternatives to pricey habits, if you have any. Always going to coffee shops for your cup of joe? Make the coffee at home and buy a nice coaster to put it in instead. Even if you buy a coffee machine and some good quality coffee beans instead of the cheaper instant coffee packs, you’ll still end up spending less compared to how much you spend in shops in the long run. Step 6: Learn to cook  Cooking is always more economical than eating out. Learning to cook for yourself instead of relying on takeout will even help you stay healthy as much as it will save you money. If you have a busy schedule and can only spend a few minutes in the kitchen everyday, try cooking meals that you can make in under ten minutes. It’s also a good idea to prepare meals by the batch during weekends, so you’ll only need to reheat them during the work week. Also, keep a stash of instant sauces, canned meat, and other ready-made food items for when you’re really in a pinch. Step 7: Have basic handyman skills  Aside from cooking, you should also learn basic handyman skills for minor repairs and whatnots around your home or in your car. This way, you wouldn’t have to pay for a repairman and you’ll also feel proud about being independent enough to know how to fix things. If you own a car, you should know how to change your tires, jumpstart your battery, change your oil, etc. And in your home, you should know how to fix leaky faucets, change door knobs, and unclog a drain among other things. Step 8: Keep track of your progress  Keep track of your spending habits to make sure you are within budget. Also, it will give you a rough estimate of how much you’ve already saved. This is important because it helps motivate you to keep going. There are a wide variety of  apps that you can download on your phone for this purpose. All you need to do is log your monthly earnings and expenses, then most of the apps will be able to show you a breakdown of your spending habits. Becoming more mindful of where you spend your money is important in learning how to save. Step 9: Start an emergency fund  You should start an emergency fund once you have enough money set aside. It should be able to cover large expenses like medical bills or major auto repairs, and should ideally have at least 3 months worth of your monthly expenses so it will be able to support you in case you suddenly lose your job. Think of your emergency fund as your personal insurance—it is important to have one because it will help keep you from sinking into debt from unforeseen incidents. Step 10: Turn your savings into an investment  In some cases, choosing the cheaper option doesn’t always mean you are able to save more. If you’re living in a rented space, think of how much you’ve already spent on rent in all the years you’ve lived there. That money is money down the drain because you don’t get anything from it. But if you take the same money and invest it in buying your own home, you get something back for your hard-earned cash. Of course, the reason we save money is to secure our loved ones’ future. And the best way to do that is by making sure that they have a roof over their heads that they can call their own. Investing your money in real estate means that it wouldn’t just be sitting in the bank—it would grow. San Miguel Properties, Inc is one of the leading property developers in the country today.

"Anesthesia before age 2 may result in poorer development, literacy and numeracy scores, says new study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/293059/anesthesia-age-2-may-result-poorer-development-literacy-numeracy-scores-says-new-study/,"06:22 PM April 30, 2018","New Australian research has found that young children exposed to general anesthesia may have poorer development and lower literacy and numeracy school scores later in childhood than children not exposed to anesthesia. Carried out by researchers at the University of Sydney, the large-scale study looked at 211,978 healthy children and compared the developmental and school results of those who had been exposed to general anesthesia before age four to children of the same age who hadn’t been exposed. The researchers looked at either the children’s school entry developmental assessment in 2009 or 2012, or their Grade 3 school test results (when children are aged 8 to 9). They found that those who had been exposed to general anesthesia more than once had a 17 percent increased risk of poor child development, a 34 percent increased risk of lower numeracy scores on school tests, and a 23 percent increased risk of lower reading scores on school tests. When the researchers looked at the children who had undergone only one procedure requiring general anaesthesia, they found that there was no increased risk for poor development or reduced reading scores, but there was still an increased risk of poor numeracy scores. “There are many reasons why a child requires surgery or investigation, and, in some cases, this may be lifesaving or unavoidable,” said the study’s senior author, Prof. Natasha Nassar. “For these children, our findings suggest that it is important to follow-up and monitor their literacy and numeracy skills when they reach school, and ensure early intervention, if required.” “Determining exactly what is causing this effect is not easy. The children receiving a general anaesthetic in this study also had surgery, and often had other associated medical conditions,” said co-author Dr. Justin Skowno. “There are some procedures where alternative approaches or management may be possible, but the majority of surgeries in young infants and children cannot easily be postponed.” “Parents can certainly discuss with their doctor and explore whether these procedures can be avoided, combined with other procedures, delayed to older ages or treated with alternatives to surgery, or other methods of sedation,” added Dr. Skowno. The findings come after a study published just last week found that, despite concerns, there is no evidence to suggest that giving anesthesia to children under the age of three years can affect intelligence. However, it concluded that being exposed to anesthesia several times as a small child could cause modest declines in fine motor skills, such as ability to draw figures with a pencil, and how quickly children process information when reading. Children who had anesthesia just once before their third birthday may also have more problems with executive functions, the skills which help with memory, impulse control, planning and flexibility. The results of the new study were published in Pediatric Anesthesia. JB RELATED STORIES: Could low levels of iron and vitamin B12 contribute to bad behavior in young boys?

"Retirement could make seniors more sedentary, new study finds",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/293037/retirement-make-seniors-sedentary-new-study-finds/,"04:58 PM April 30, 2018","New European research has found that transitioning into retirement can bring a more sedentary lifestyle for seniors, highlighting the need to stay active with age. Carried out by researchers at the University of Turku, Finland, the team looked at 2,011 participants and surveyed them on their sedentary behavior habits, including watching television, using a computer at home and sitting in a vehicle. The team conducted 3.4 surveys on average, which were carried out once a year as the participants transitioned into retirement to measure the amount of sitting before and after retiring. The results showed that on average, transitioning to retirement increased the amount of time spent sitting from four and a half to six hours per day. The researchers noted that from the specific activities, the time spent watching television increased the most, by 28 minutes per day. Computer use at home increased by 19 minutes per day, and time sitting in a vehicle by 6 minutes per day, while other sitting time increased by 37 minutes per day. Lead author Tuija Leskinen also added, “Sitting increased especially among women and those who had been sitting a great deal at work, had a low physical activity level, and who suffered from sleep difficulties, mental disorders or poor health before retirement.” The findings could be significant as seniors spend a significant amount of their time sitting, which has been linked to a variety of health problems. The researchers also noted that television viewing has also been linked with an increased risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. “More attention needs to be paid to the amount of sitting after retirement,” commented Leskinen. “Our research results suggest that there might be risk groups among those retiring that are more likely to increase the amount of sitting after their retirement transition. However, objective measurements of sedentary behaviour are still needed to confirm our results.” The researchers noted that sedentary behavior and the health risks associated with it can be reduced by taking breaks from sitting and increasing light activity throughout the day. Many previous studies have also noted the importance of staying active as we age, with many suggesting that even light physical activity, such as walking the dog and light housework, can help reduce sedentary time and lower the risk of disease in seniors. For those who feel able, moderate to higher intensity exercise has been shown to bring even greater benefits, while strength training has been linked with decreased fraility and a decreased risk of falls.

Going home to Chernobyl ghost town 32 years on,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/292816/going-home-to-chernobyl-ghost-town-32-years-on/,"05:45 PM April 27, 2018","Natalia Shevchuk gazes at the peeling walls inside her old flat and tears run down her cheeks: 32 years after the Chernobyl disaster she is finally revisiting her childhood home in the ghost town of Pripyat. “Come inside, this is Apartment No. 3, we lived here until 1986,” she says, as memories stir up from when she was 18, the last time she was in the building. Now 50, Shevchuk’s world was ripped apart on April 26, 1986, when a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded in then-Soviet Ukraine, spewing a cloud of radioactive material across several European countries. All the inhabitants of Pripyat, a town of nearly 50,000 built just two kilometers from the plant to house its employees, were evacuated the day after the world’s worst nuclear disaster. Shevchuk’s parents and her sister were among those who fled, while she happened to be staying in Kiev at the time. On a tatty bookcase, some of the family’s old books lie unread amongst the dirt, dusty relics of another century. “It was my mum who bought this one,” Shevchuk says. She points to a yellow-colored book called “Ulyanovs” about the family of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, the Russian revolutionary better known as Lenin, and starts to cry. The huge meltdown at Chernobyl poisoned the air with deadly radioactivity but the disaster was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities. Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet head of state, did not make a public statement about it until May 14, more than two weeks after the event. Eventually, nearly 350,000 people were evacuated from within a 30-kilometer radius around the plant, an exclusion zone that remains uninhabited, apart from some 150 elderly residents who returned despite an official ban. “It was a very hard blow for them,” Shevchuk recalls. “My parents could not accept the fact that they would not return here again.” Her father came back to help in the power plant clean-up operation in the years afterwards but like other former residents was barred from living in his old home. Worst nuclear disaster For a long time Shevchuk, who now lives in Kiev, did not feel mentally ready to return to Pripyat and see the town of her childhood. “I wondered what impact (the radiation) would have on my health because I had children to raise,” she says. “But this year, I realized it was time to go, because the buildings are falling apart.” The decaying remains of the town have come to symbolize the effects of a nuclear disaster. Blocks of flats stand with broken windows, roads are covered with moss, and dense vegetation has made the deserted neighborhoods almost unrecognizable. As a Geiger counter beeps continuously, signaling high radiation levels, Shevchuk pushes through the undergrowth and uses a GPS navigator to find the address she is looking for: 30 Lesya Ukrainka Street. “It’s here!” Shevchuk stops, gasping. She is with her husband on a day-long tour of the area. “Do you think I can go inside?” she asks. The authorities in charge of the exclusion zone forbid entering buildings because of the risk of collapse — but they walk into the dark entrance hall. “Here is the list of residents! Shevchuk, apartment number three! That’s my surname!” she cries out. Hurriedly walking forwards, she arrives at the entrance of her old apartment on the ground floor. The front door stands open and she goes inside. “It’s so small, it used to be so big,” she says, commenting on the living room as she crosses the crumbling, moldy floor. Her husband Volodymyr, a strongly built man with a buzz cut, films the moment so they can show their two sons back home. “She was dreaming about this for a long time and I said: ‘Let’s go,'” he says. Later, she regains her composure and almost looks serene. “I didn’t expect ever to get here,” she says. “I’ve found what I had lost, at least a small part of my memory,” adding that she feels “guilt” that the disaster was allowed to happen. “It was a shock at first, but now I feel I have done my duty to my town and my apartment,” she says. “I don’t forget and I never will forget.” CC RELATED STORIES: Ukraine to launch its first solar plant at Chernobyl Test finds Chernobyl residue in Belarus milk  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
More evidence that exercise can stave off depression found by new analysis,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/292737/p2fb-new-analysis-finds-evidence-exercise-can-stave-off-depression/,"08:37 PM April 26, 2018","New international research has found more evidence to suggest that exercise can prevent the onset of depression, and could be beneficial in people of all ages. Carried out by King’s College London along with researchers from Brazil, Belgium, Australia, the United States and Sweden, together the team looked at 49 studies which set out to examine if physical activity could decrease the risk of developing depression. The studies included a total of 266,939 participants, none of whom had mental illness, who were followed up on average after 7.4 years. After taking into account important risk factors such as body mass index, smoking and physical health, the researchers found that compared to those who engaged in low levels of physical activity, those with high levels had lower odds of developing depression. In addition, physical activity also protected both youths, adults and seniors as well as participants across a range of geographical regions including Europe, North America and Oceania. Commenting on the findings, lead author Professor Dr Felipe Barreto Schuch, Universidade La Salle (Brazil), said, “This is the first global meta-analysis to establish that engaging in physical activity is beneficial for protecting the general population from developing depression. We have looked at whether these effects happen at different age groups and across different continents and the results are clear. Regardless your age or where you live, physical activity can reduce the risk of having depression later in life.” Co-author Dr. Joseph Firth, Research Fellow at NICM Health Research Institute at Western Sydney University, also commented, saying, “The compelling evidence presented here provides an even stronger case for engaging all people in regular physical activity; through schools, workplaces, leisure programs and elsewhere, in order to reduce the risk of depression across the lifespan.” The team added that further studies would now be useful to investigate the minimum amount of physical activity needed to reduce the risk of depression, as well as the effects of different types of activity. The results can be found online in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

Could low levels of iron and vitamin B12 contribute to bad behavior in young boys?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/292734/p2fb-low-levels-iron-vitamin-b12-contribute-bad-behavior-young-boys/,"08:04 PM April 26, 2018","New research has found that a deficiency of iron and vitamin B12 in young boys around age 8 could be linked to behavior problems later in childhood. Led by the University of Michigan School of Public Health, United States, the new study set out to assess whether levels of iron, blood concentrations of zinc, folate, vitamins A and B12, and anemia were associated with behavior problems in 1,042 children age 5-12 in Bogotá, Colombia. The researchers looked at both internalizing behaviors, such as anxiety and depression, and externalizing behaviors, such as being aggressive and breaking rules. The team took blood samples to measure levels of the micronutrients and conducted an in-person follow-up assessment with around one-third of the participants after six years, using a questionnaire to assess behavior. After taking into account other factors such as age at the start of the study, time spent watching television or playing video games, and socioeconomic status, the results showed that iron deficiency, anemia and low plasma vitamin B12 levels in boys at around age 8 were associated with 10 percent higher mean scores on the questionnaire for externalizing behaviors, with iron deficiency also related to a 12 percent higher score for internalizing problems. “Iron deficiency is still highly prevalent in many regions worldwide,” commented senior author Eduardo Villamor. “There is less data on vitamin B12 deficiency but available evidence also suggests it may be a substantial public health problem in certain populations.” Villamor added that the findings could also be relevant to other populations and that fortunately, correcting a deficiency may not always be complicated. “In our study population, for example, we showed before that a school snack program increased vitamin B12 blood levels after three months,” he said. Previous research on infants has also found a link between iron deficiency and subsequent behavior problems, however no known research had studied the effects of these micronutrient deficiencies in older children. As to why the deficiencies may affect behavior, Villamor explained that some parts of the brain develop during childhood, and as these brain regions respond to environmental conditions at different life stages they could be involved in the development of behavior problems. The researchers found no associations among girls, with Villamor commenting that “we don’t have a clear explanation of why there were sex differences, although we knew it was important to study boys and girls separately because they may differ in the timing of development.” “Studies in rats have found that some micronutrient deficiencies affect male and female brains differently but it is not clear exactly why this may also be the case in humans,” Villamor added. The results can be found online in the Journal of Nutrition.

How rude colleagues could be affecting your sleep,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/292620/rude-colleagues-affecting-sleep/,"03:23 PM April 25, 2018","Working with impolite colleagues could be contributing to insomnia, according to new United States research. However, trying to put the day behind you and switch off with fun activities could be one solution to sleeping better at night. Carried out by researchers from Oakland University, Portland State University, Oregon Health & Science University and the USDA Forest Service, the team surveyed 699 employees of the U.S. Forest Service. The participants were asked to rate the level of rude behavior they experienced in the workplace as well as how often they had negative thoughts about work. They were also asked whether they experienced any symptoms of insomnia, how much alcohol they drank, whether they were able to detach from work at the end of the day and in the evenings, and whether they were able relax and make time for leisure activities. The team also asked participants about other factors that have been found to influence sleep, including how many children under 18 lived at home, the number of hours worked per week and alcoholic intake. The results showed that rude or negative behavior at work, such as being judged or verbally abused, was linked with more symptoms of insomnia, including waking up multiple times during the night. However, those who switched off from work and made time for relaxing activities such as doing yoga, taking a walk, or even just listening to music, slept better. “Incivility in the workplace takes a toll on sleep quality,” said lead author Caitlin Demsky. “It does so in part by making people repeatedly think about their negative work experiences. Those who can take mental breaks from this fare better and do not lose as much sleep as those who are less capable of letting go.” “Sleep quality is crucial because sleep plays a major role in how employees perform and behave at work,” continued Demsky. “In our fast-paced, competitive professional world, it is more important than ever that workers are in the best condition to succeed, and getting a good night’s sleep is key to that.” As well as a dip in performance, a lack of sleep has also been linked to a variety of health conditions including obesity, Alzheimer’s disease, depression and diabetes. The authors added that repeated negative thoughts about work may also be linked to an increased risk of certain health problems, including cardiovascular diseases, increased blood pressure and fatigue. Demsky suggests that managers can help by setting a good example to employees by not sending work-related messages outside of business hours. The team also added that another potential way to help improve civility in the workplace is to implement programs that promote positive and respectful communication among co-workers. The results can be found online in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, published by the American Psychological Association.

"Berries may contain cancer-fighting compounds, says new research",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/291164/p2fb-berries-may-contain-cancer-fighting-compounds-says-new-research/,"07:38 PM April 08, 2018","New European research has found that a naturally occurring pigment in berries could increase the function of an enzyme which reduces the expression of cancer genes and cancer cell growth. Carried out by the University of Eastern Finland, the study looked at the effect of the pigments that give berries their color, known as flavonoids, on the function of the sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) enzyme in cancer cells. Sirtuins are enzymes which regulate the expression of genes that control the function of cells. The aging process can change sirtuin function, which can contribute to the development of various diseases. As flavonoids are known to have an antioxidant effect on the body and provide important health benefits, the team wanted to see if they could affect the function of SIRT6, which has been linked to longevity, metabolism, DNA-repair, and reduced inflammation. The researchers found that cyanidin, a compound which belongs to a group of flavonoids known as anthocyanidins, increased SIRT6 enzyme levels in human colorectal cancer cells, decreased the expression of two cancer genes, and increased the expression of a tumor suppressing gene in cells. The findings suggest that cyanidin, which is found in wild bilberry, blackcurrant and lingonberry, could potentially be used in future cancer treatments, such as drugs that regulate SIRT6 function. The study is not the first to suggest that berries could have a positive effect on health, the fruits have long been touted for their health benefits and their potential to prevent a variety of other diseases and conditions. A large-scale 2016 study published in The British Medical Journal which followed 124,086 men and women across the United States found that those who had a high intake of flavonoids, such as anthocyanins found in blackberries, blackcurrants, blueberries and strawberries, gained less weight over a 24-year period. Another study published the same year which followed 50,000 middle-age men also found that a diet rich in flavonoids could reduce the risk of erectile dysfunction by 14 percent. Of the six flavonoids studied, three in particular appeared to be the most beneficial, including anthocyanins. Research from Poland also found that blackberries, raspberries and the lesser-known black raspberry, all had a high level of antioxidant activity that could be beneficial in boosting health. Antioxidants are thought to decrease or reverse the effects of free radicals, the natural byproducts of energy production that are closely linked with heart disease, cancer, arthritis, stroke and respiratory diseases, with black raspberries found in the study to have a level three times higher than red raspberries or blackberries. Other small-scale studies have also linked berries to improved cognitive function, improved attention, better mood, better memory and decreased mental fatigue, with some researchers suggesting that the beneficial effects could also help decrease the risk of Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, stress, anxiety and even depression.

Int’l Children’s Book Day 2018: How reading can make your child more fluent and imaginative,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/290581/intl-childrens-book-day-2018-how-reading-can-make-your-child-more-fluent-and-imaginative/,"05:49 PM April 02, 2018","Monday, April 2 marks International Children’s Book Day 2018, which aims to promote and inspire a love of reading among children around the world. Reading is not only a source of joy for both children and parents, but also has many added health benefits, whether books are read alone or together as a family. Here we round up some recent research on the benefits for children’s health, development and imagination. Boost language learning A 2015 United States study which looked at the effects of different toys on children’s learning found that traditional toys, including books, were more effective in increasing the quantity and quality of language than modern electronic toys. The small-scale study looked at 26 children aged 10 to 16 months, and found that along with traditional toys, such as wooden puzzles and shape-sorters, reading encouraged “a rich communicative interaction between parents and infants,” with parents talking more and using more vocabulary associated with themes in the book than when playing. Boost literacy skills Research presented at the 2017 Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting suggested that reading to children as babies could boost their literacy skills for years to come. The researchers found that mothers reading to babies during early infancy boosted language, vocabulary and literacy skills, with results lasting up to four years later. In addition, the team also found that the quality of the books read strongly affected early reading skills, while both the quality and quantity of books read had a strong impact on children’s later literacy skills, such as being able to write their name at age four. Boost imagination A small-scale 2015 study of 19 preschoolers aged 3 to 5 years old showed for the first time that reading during early childhood appears to have a measurable and positive effect on the brain. After measuring how much parent-child reading the children were exposed to at home, the researchers took MRI scans of the children’s brains while they were listening to stories via headphones. They found that children exposed to more reading showed increased brain activity in the areas critical for oral language and reading, as well as the areas linked to mental imagery, which can boost children’s imagination and enable them to “see” the story. Boost vocabulary Norwegian research which looked at 1,171 first-grade pupils and their parents found that children whose parents read to them in early childhood and who grew up in homes with lots of books were better-prepared to learn to read when starting school, in part due to having a larger vocabulary. Children who were read to before age two, and who had access to plenty of children’s books had a vocabulary that is almost twice that of those who have less books at home and who were only read aloud to after the age of four years, added the researchers. A wide vocabulary helps boost children’s reading, and ups school performance, as children understand more of what is happening and find it easier to keep up in class.

"Worried that walking to work takes too much time? It’s probably not as long as you think, says study",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/290456/p2fb-worried-walking-work-takes-much-time-probably-not-long-think-says-new-study/,"04:26 PM April 01, 2018","New research suggests that many people may be put off from walking or cycling to work because they think it is too far, when in fact most of us overestimate how long it will take. Researchers at Penn State University in the United States recruited 253 faculty and staff and 252 students at at the university for the study and questioned them on how often they drove, took the bus, walked, or biked to campus. Participants were also asked how they felt about walking or biking instead of taking the car, sometimes referred to as “active travel,” how physically fit they were, and how long they thought it would take them to walk or bike from their home to campus. The researchers then calculated the actual travel times using Google Maps. They found that around 91 percent of the staff and students misestimated how long it would take to walk to campus, and around 93 percent misestimated how long it would take to cycle, with almost everyone overestimating the travel time. Students were a little better at staff in estimating travel times, but around 55 percent were still incorrect about walking times, while around 43 percent misestimated cycling times. “People in general aren’t very good at estimating how long it’s going to take to get somewhere,” said Melissa Bopp, associate professor of kinesiology, Penn State. “That’s problematic when you’re trying to get someone to walk or bike somewhere. Traveling by foot or bike has a lot of benefits, but not a lot of people do it. They may think they can’t do it because it’s too far and it’ll take too long, when it turns out it’s really not.” “For example, people who aren’t familiar with walk or bike travel tend to assume you use the same route you would drive, which might be along a busy road,” explained Bopp. “Meanwhile, in actuality, there’s a perfectly lovely bike path that only crosses that busy road once. That’s a knowledge gap we can fix.” Despite the many advantages of active travel, such as better health and less air pollution, more than 90 percent of Americans drive a car to work according to the researchers, with Bopp adding that learning more about why people don’t walk or bike more often will help to encourage more people to start. In addition, she said increasing self-confidence could also boost the number of people choosing active travel over taking the car. “For faculty and staff, self-confidence for walking and biking in town or on campus was a huge predictor,” Bopp said. “We can have all the bike lanes in the world, but if you don’t feel confident to go out there and bike, then you’re not going to do it. But luckily, self-confidence is a targetable thing. Providing education, encouragement and resources can help with that. There are urban biking classes you can take, for example.” The results can be found published online in the journal Tranportmetrica A: Transport Science.

Current guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which were issued back in 2008, recommend U.S. adults partake in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week. However, the guidelines also state that activity needs to last for at least 10 minutes at a time, as shorter intervals do not provide the same health benefits. With many Americans exposed to mixed messages about what amount of exercise really makes the difference to our health, the new research wanted to assess which type of physical activity was actually effective in reducing the risk of death and disease. “For about 30 years, guidelines have suggested that moderate-to-vigorous activity could provide health benefits, but only if you sustained the activity for 10 minutes or more,” said study author William E. Kraus, M.D., at Duke University, “That flies in the face of public health recommendations, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, and parking farther from your destination. Those don’t take 10 minutes, so why were they recommended?” For the new study Kraus, along with researchers from the National Cancer Institute, analyzed data from 4,840 people age 40 and older who were asked to wear accelerometers to measure their physical activity and exertion over a seven-day period. They found that even a small amount of physical activity helped to reduce overall risk of death and disease, although the more participants did, the greater the benefits. The team found that participants who got less than 20 minutes of moderate or vigorous activity each day had the highest risk of death, but those who managed to get 60 minutes per day cut their risk of death by 57 percent. Increasing this to at least 100 minutes per day cut risk of death by 76 percent. To achieve these minutes, the study found that even the shortest burst of exercise counted, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, as long as they were performed at a moderate to vigorous intensity level. The study defined a moderate level of intensity as brisk walking at a pace that makes it hard to carry a conversation. For most people, vigorous exercise would be increasing walking to a jog. Kraus says the findings, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, are good news for many Americans, as accumulating 30 minutes of exercise throughout the day is often more achievable than setting aside time for a 30-minute workout. Meanwhile, the body of evidence for exercise’s effect on our mental as well as physical well-being continues to grown as an Australian review published this week found that stopping exercise could increase depressive symptoms. After partaking in at least 30 minutes of exercise three times a week for a minimum of three months, those who stopped showed an increase in their symptoms, some within just one to two weeks.

Maura De Leon: Queen of Philippine Stevia,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/289778/maura-de-leon-queen-philippine-stevia/,"02:51 PM March 23, 2018"," Mrs. Maura De Leon had all the reasons to opt for a more laidback, fashionable, and more propitious business, having tried and excelled in several businesses before, the farmer in her compelled her to venture into probably one of the most rare, yet very healthy agricultural plant — Stevia. Back in the 90s, De Leon Was doing well in her garments business in Bulacan, although her business suffered several challenges, she managed to grow her business amid stiff competition in the province. Humble beginnings For about three years, she thought of a perfect business that will not only be significant but something that can be beneficial to many Filipinos. During that time she was in coffee business already, determined to unravel the myth that had been nagging her for years, when one of her staffs suggested they should revolutionize the coffee business in the country or might as well shift to another venture since all coffee shops in the country offer the same products but differ only in presentation and marketing strategies. Then in one of her consultations, a friend who is a doctor told her about this miracle plant that originated in Paraguay commonly known as Stevia. The leaves of this South American shrub have been used for centuries by native people in Paraguay and Brazil to sweeten their yerba mate and other stimulant beverages. The stevia plant belongs to the Compositae (sunflower family of plants).  After hearing about it, she was fascinated and fell in love with the idea that she immediately asked her team to do their research, sending an agriculturist to Baguio, La Union, Bicol and Davao and found out that not one farmer in the country is growing Stevia for commercial purposes here in the country. Soon enough, after doing a series of soil analysis, she purchased a small piece of land where she can grow the said plant. Her daughter who was studying in Europe was also instrumental for the purchase of stevia seeds. But everything is not like a fairytale story for De Leon and her stevia. “The business was very challenging for us, there were times that I tried to just let go of everything and pursue another business,” she said. Planting Stevia in itself was a big challenge for her and everybody in the team. For the first three years, everything was a testing period since they are not really familiar with the plant unlike those South Americans.  Literally, she did the farming herself and it looked like what she was doing was getting nowhere. When she was at the thick of her hardships, her father approached her and asked if she really, sincerely devoted to her resolve and she gave him a terse reply and a convincing nod. Then her father said something she cannot forget that made here to push even more and conquer the odds.  “He told me, anak, ituloy mo, tulungan mo mga magsasaka. (While pointing at a painting hanging on the wall) Tignan mo yung kalabaw, mataba pa kaysa farmer,” recounts De Leon. In that instance, she realized that she cannot give up anymore, not only she has spent and sacrificed a lot but a lot of people are looking up to her to deliver. In the fifth year since she got into that commitment, she was able to produce the first finished product out of stevia. The wonders of Stevia (Sweet & Fit) For years, those with diabetes have been suffering to scrim on their sugar intake so as to not aggravate their conditions. Now that De Leon through its company – Glorious Industrial & Development Corp. (GIDC) has perfected the process of extracting the sweet essence of stevia and manufactured it as the healthiest sweetener — Sweet & Fit Stevia, people who have health concerns regarding sweets can again enjoy their sweet tooth. Everyone now can binge on the delights you crave without the worry of risking your health. Sweet & Fit Stevia is a low-calorie sugar, which to most is a wonder sweetener, and recognized as the best and safest  all-natural sugar. It is 30 times sweeter than sugar and with no effect on blood sugar and little aftertaste.  It is now the most trusted, safest and effective calorie-free sugar fix from an all-natural alternative to artificial sweeteners. Once limited to the health-food market, the plant-derived sweetener is now widely available in the country and rapidly replacing artificial sweeteners in consumer products. Stevia, the source of Sweet & Fit Stevia, has a taste that is unique and has been described as very sweet with a slight licorice, almost bitter aftertaste. Generally, high quality stevia contains very little of this bitterness. The sweetness of Stevia is much different than the sweetness of other natural sweeteners, sugar, or artificial sweeteners, but it is delicious. For some people the taste may require some “getting used to,” but most people quickly develop a taste for it. “Stevia is a natural, non-caloric, sweet-tasting plant used around the world for its pleasant taste, as well as for its increasingly researched potential for inhibiting fat absorption and lowering blood pressure. Stevia is about 300 times sweeter than sugar in its natural state, and much more so when processed. Its medicinal uses include regulating blood sugar, preventing hypertension, treatment of skin disorders, and prevention of tooth decay,” according to www.bewellbuzz.com. Sweet & Fit, 1st Stevia sweetener in the Philippines Sweet & Fit Stevia is a product that comes from the essence of stevia and GIDC guarantees that it has preserved and maintained the healthy properties of this plant. “Sweet & Fit Stevia has all the health benefits of stevia. Sweet & Fit Stevia is best for those who are diabetics, watching their weight or people who just want to be healthy. We don’t need to go to other countries just to have stevia, we already have it here through Sweet & Fit Stevia,” De Leon quipped. GIDC is proud to be the first producer of Stevia sweetener in the Philippines with the introduction of Sweet & Fit in the market in 2009. Sweet & Fit’s presence in the Philippines also speaks of De Leon’s resolve to empower famers and bring innovations and diversity to the local selection of crops available to farmers. Armed with the chant GROW LOCAL, GO GLOBAL, GIDC also encourages local farmers to engage in harvesting high-quality produce, which are beneficial to Filipinos, as well as to the rest of the world. Reaching out to bigger market Since GIDC continues to find ways to improve the quality of its products and serve more customers who share their passion for health and wellness, the company is also open to toll packing and manufacturing. For De Leon, she could easily get the biggest slice of the pie since she is the pioneer in producing stevia sweetener, but due to her desire to make this healthy sweetener available to all, her company has been accepting toll packing and manufacturing. “Everyone deserves to be healthy and it is just right to have access to healthy products, this is the reason we welcome other companies and business establishments all over the country should they want to manufacture foods and beverages sweetened by Sweet & Fit Stevia,” De Leon added. Since GIDC opened its toll packing and manufacturing of stevia sweetener, the awareness of the people about stevia has also grown and slowly, more consumers are shifting from table sugar to this Sweet & Fit Stevia.  “We are proud to have partnered with different hotels, coffee shops, multinational companies and medium-scale entrepreneurs in making stevia a healthy alternative for sugar. Our goal is to entice food and beverage manufacturing companies, hotels, coffee shops to use Sweet & Fit Stevia,” she stressed. GIDC is looking at a brighter future but De Leon is happy that she can tell her father that they have succeeded and the farmers, at least in their employ, are in good hands.

"Kids start caring about their reputations from as young as 5, says new research",https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/289702/kids-start-caring-reputations-young-5-says-new-research/,"07:59 PM March 22, 2018","Newly published research has found that, like adults, children also care about their reputation, and are taking measures to manage it by the time they start elementary school. As adults, most of us know how our reputation can affect various aspects of our life, and we often work hard at promoting a positive image of ourselves to others. However, many psychologists have so far been skeptical that children under the age of nine care about reputation or employ complex behaviors to manipulate it. However, according to new evidence brought together in a review by Alex Shaw, assistant professor of developmental psychology at the University of Chicago and Ike Silver, a doctoral student at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, children begin to manage the impressions they give to others and understand how others are also managing their own reputation, around the age of five. Research has shown that children vary their behavior based on their audience and social context, with one study showing that 5-year-old children are consistently more generous when they know they are being observed, and another revealing that children will be more generous towards those who are more key in their social group than towards those who they know they won’t meet again. When they have a positive reputation kids also appear to actively change their behavior in order to maintain it. One experiment found that when preschoolers and kindergarteners were told that they had a good reputation in the eyes of their classmates, they were much less likely to cheat than peers who didn’t have such a positive reputation. Young children also seem to be adept at tracking and evaluating others’ reputations. By age five they already expect that others will talk about their successes more than their failures, and they also seem to know that they can help others boost their reputation and social standing in the classroom, for example by offering positive evaluations of classmates. By age six, they begin to think negatively of those who try to harm someone else’s reputation, for example by taking credit for positive actions such as helping behavior or a good idea, or by falsely blaming others for negative actions. “Psychologists have been long interested in how we construct our identities and the sorts of strategies that we use to present ourselves in society,” says Shaw, “We’re finding that the kinds of complex and strategic self-presentation behavior we see in adults appear at a much younger age than previously known.” “Moving forward, a question we’re thinking about is, ‘What happens even earlier than age five?’ We don’t believe children show up to the first day of kindergarten and have the idea of reputation suddenly pop into existence,” added Silver. “As we start to understand that reputational strategies emerge before the age of 9 as was previously believed, the next logical question is, ‘what happens even earlier?'” The results can be found published online in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences.

How to make your reusable coffee cup more hygienic,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/287734/p2fb-how-to-make-your-reusable-coffee-cup-more-hygienic/,"07:01 PM March 01, 2018","New research is advising eco-loving coffee drinkers to wash their reusable cups as soon as possible after use, finding that they can become a breeding ground for harmful bacteria if left unwashed for too long. Carried out by researchers at Aston University in the United Kingdom, the study observed the different ways people used their coffee cups over a one-week period, from rinsing it immediately after finishing a drink to leaving leftover coffee in the cup and washing it before the next use. The team found that cups left unwashed until the next use pose a greater risk than those rinsed or cleaned shortly after a drink is finished. “Drink residues left in reusable cups are a good source of nutrients for bacteria which can multiply rapidly during storage,” explained Professor Anthony Hilton, deputy executive dean of Life & Health Sciences at Aston University. “If the cup is refilled without appropriate cleaning, these bacteria can represent a significant source of contamination. Consumers should be mindful of reusable cup hygiene and clean them in the same way they would any other food contact surface,” he said. Reusable coffee cups have grown in popularity in recent months as consumers become more aware of the harm disposable cups pose to the environment. The Independent reported back in January a new strategy set out by the Environmental Audit Committee to help the U.K. reduce waste caused by the 2.5 billion coffee cups thrown away each year. As well as promoting the use of reusable cups the strategy also includes the introduction of a 25-pence surcharge on disposable cups, dubbed the “latte levy,” and for all coffee cups to be recycled by 2023. Just this week, coffee giant Starbucks introduced a 5-pence charge on disposable coffee cups for London customers, but as some believe this won’t make a big enough impact many in the U.K. are instead switching to buying their own cup. However, as reusable coffee cups are often used for on-the-go purposes, washing them right after drinking isn’t always easy. The study has now led to calls for reusable cups to be developed with anti-microbial protection to reduce the presence of bacteria, even in cups that are not washed straightaway. Many currently available on the market however, are made of traditional materials such as glass or ceramic, although they are often reinforced to prevent breakages. Although glass is often a preferred choice for those concerned about the taste of their coffee, a potentially more hygienic option is to choose one made from bamboo fiber. As well as being reusable, bamboo is the world’s most sustainable crop, is also biodegradable, and has anti-bacterial properties, meaning it helps tick the boxes for being eco-friendly, but not so bacteria-friendly. Commenting on the findings of the study Simon Ellin, chief executive of The Recycling Association, is urging the public to continue using reusable cups for the good of the environment, but added that consumers should be wary about hygiene risks. “We welcome the public’s desire to reuse items such as coffee cups but would want them to do so with caution and make sure they wash their cups thoroughly and, if possible, choose one with anti-microbial product protection.” JB RELATED STORIES: Growing up in greener neighborhoods may boost brain development  Eight reasons to date a tree-hugger  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018

Could the Swedish trend of ‘plogging’ help you get fit in 2018?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/287090/swedish-trend-plogging-help-get-fit-2018/,"06:20 PM February 20, 2018","Scandinavia has brought us various wellness trends in the last few years, with the Danes’ love of hygge encouraging us to get cozy during winter, while lagom from Sweden advised “everything in moderation” for a more balanced lifestyle all year round. It is now Sweden’s turn again to get us all hooked on a new trend, this time in the form of “plogging.” A combination of the Swedish words for “run” and “pick up,” plogging involves picking up litter during your run, making the new sport not only good for your health but also the environment. Although it has already been popular for a couple of years in its native Sweden, plogging is quickly spreading to other European countries such as the UK, Germany, and France, and even as far as Mexico and India. There has been a flurry of Instagram posts from “ploggers” in the last few days alone, accompanied by the hashtag of the moment, #plogging. Although its rise in popularity has been sudden, it is probably not surprising, with increasing concern around environmental issues such as climate change, air pollution, and more specifically related to plogging, the global levels of plastic use and waste. But as well as helping to clean up the planet, plogging also brings personal health benefits. Although some may not like the idea of constant stopping and starting during their run, breaking to pick up litter before shooting off again will turn your run into a form of interval training, often shown to be an effective way to not only boost fitness levels but also lose any excess weight. It’s also a good way for beginners to get started with running, as you can take breaks and run shorter, more comfortable distances until you build up your endurance. Squatting down and bending over to pick things up will also benefit runners of all levels, helping to work different muscle groups and extending the range of motion. And unlike other forms of running, such as long-distance training, plogging is perhaps even more effective with friends. More hands will not only lighten the work and enable you to pick up even more trash, but plogging in a group will also add a social element to your run which can help keep you motivated. If you don’t know anyone interested in plogging with you many groups are now popping up in cities such as Paris and Edinburgh, encouraging runners both old and new to get off the treadmill and head outdoors into nature or to explore the city. Which of course can be enjoyed even more once it is litter free. MKH RELATED STORIES: WATCH: 93-year-old woman’s adorable workout melts netizens’ hearts No-sweat exercise may prolong life for the elderly – study  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
Is it possible to avoid endocrine disruptors?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/286398/possible-avoid-endocrine-disruptors/,"07:52 PM February 12, 2018","How do you limit your exposure to endocrine disruptors? Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are present in a wide range of consumer products like cosmetics, food products, as well as toys and clothing. A study out of the United Kingdom this week indicated that 86 percent of teenagers have traces of one of the most common, Bisphenol A (BPA) in their bodies. Meanwhile a report published on Feb. 2 by a French government agency warns that EDCs are still insufficiently regulated and under researched. Avoidance remains the best policy: here’s a list of things you can do to limit the risks for you and your family. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which are hard to detect and difficult to avoid, are a justifiable cause for concern. Even at low doses, these compounds, which are present in air, water, earth and dust could be harmful to health when they are ingested, touched or inhaled. The most widely known, BPA, was identified as an endocrine disruptor by the European Chemicals Agency, the ECHA, in June 2017. Glyphosate, the world’s most widely used herbicide, is also thought to be an EDC. In view of their interference with the hormonal system, EDCs are suspected to be a cause of abnormalities like infertility, congenital malformations, developmental delays, and certain hormone-dependent cancers. The groups most at risk are expecting mothers and their future babies, infants and children reaching the age of puberty. Buying organic and adopting an ecologically responsible attitude can help limit exposure to EDCs, although organic fruit and vegetables will still have to be carefully washed and peeled. Buy in bulk to reduce contact with containers In principle, reducing contact with containers (plastic bottles and bags, cans and other packaging) will limit exposure to endocrine disruptors. For this reason, the purchase of unpackaged products has emerged as a “zero-waste” consumer trend that aims to be healthier and better for the environment. When buying baby products, it is best to shop in organic supermarkets and organic toy and clothing outlets. When breastfeeding, young mothers are advised not lto ose weight so as to avoid liberating EDCs stored in fat tissue. With regard to cleaning, traditional hard soap, distilled vinegar and sodium bicarbonate, can be combined in a variety of ways to produce environmentally friendly cleaning products that represent no hidden danger to health. Information on the recipes for these products can be obtained from blogs, online tutorials, and workshops. As for cosmetics, many products, and this includes those that are labelled organic or paraben-free, contain hard to detect endocrine disruptors like phthalates. For this reason, natural beauty products are expected to become a major trend in 2018.

How a little alcohol could help ‘clean’ the brain,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/285825/p2fb-how-a-little-alcohol-could-help-clean-the-brain/,"03:45 PM February 04, 2018","New research in the United States suggests once again that a little alcohol may be good for health, finding for the first time that it could help with the brain’s cleaning process and potentially lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Led by Maiken Nedergaard at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), the new animal study looked at the impact of alcohol exposure on the brains of mice. The study focused in on the glymphatic system, the brain’s unique cleaning process which was first described by Nedergaard and her colleagues in 2012. The system pumps the body’s cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) into brain tissue to flush away waste, including the proteins beta amyloid and tau. A buildup of these proteins in the brains is associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. After looking at animal’s exposure to high levels of alcohol over a long period of time, the researchers found high levels of a marker for inflammation, especially in cells called astrocytes which are important for the functioning of the glymphatic system. The cognitive abilities and motor skills of the mice were also impaired. However, if animals were exposed to a low level of alcohol, comparable to 2 ½ drinks per day in humans, they showed even less inflammation in the brain and a more efficient glymphatic system than the control mice who were exposed to no alcohol at all. Cognitive and motor abilities were found to be identical in both groups. Although it is well-known that excessive alcohol can increase the risk of a variety of serious health conditions, the new findings add to a growing body of research which suggests that low to moderate drinking could actually bring health benefits, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases as well as some cancers. “The data on the effects of alcohol on the glymphatic system seemingly matches the J-shaped model relating to the dose effects of alcohol on general health and mortality, whereby low doses of alcohol are beneficial, while excessive consumption is detrimental to overall health” said Nedergaard. “Studies have shown that low-to-moderate alcohol intake is associated with a lesser risk of dementia, while heavy drinking for many years confers an increased risk of cognitive decline. This study may help explain why this occurs.” Research has also shown that the glymphatic system is more active while we sleep and also improves with exercise, suggesting that a sufficient amount of sleep and physical activity could be a possible way of reducing the risk of developing dementia. Nedergaard and colleagues also found in a 2015 animal study that sleeping on the side rather than front or back could also promote the efficiency of this cleaning processing. The results can be found published online in the journal Scientific Reports. JB  CURRENT.DYNAMIC.INSIDER.",2018
Could writing your ‘to-do’ list before bedtime help you get more sleep?,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/284402/could-writing-your-to-do-list-before-bedtime-help-you-get-more-sleep/,"08:42 PM January 15, 2018","The findings from a new United States study suggest that writing a “to-do” list before bedtime could be one way to help those struggling to sleep drop off more quickly. Led by Michael K. Scullin at Baylor University, the new research examines anecdotal evidence which suggests that writing a list before bed can be helpful as it “offloads” any worries about unfinished tasks which could delay sleep. Scullin and the team recruited 57 university students for the study and asked them to spend one weeknight sleeping in a controlled environment at Baylor’s Sleep Neuroscience and Cognition Laboratory. The researchers divided participants into two randomly selected groups and gave each a writing task to do before their bedtime. One group was asked to write down everything they needed to remember to do the next day or over the next few days, while the other was asked to write about tasks they had already completed during the previous few days. Technology or work, which could negatively affect participants’ sleep, were both prohibited. The team then used overnight polysomnography, considered the “gold standard” of sleep measurement, to monitor electrical brain activity using electrodes. The results showed that participants who wrote a to-do list fell asleep significantly faster than those who wrote a list of completed activities. In addition, the more specifically participants wrote their to-do list, the faster they fell asleep. However, the opposite was found for participants who wrote about their completed activities. The findings could now be of benefit to many Americans struggling to get enough shut-eye, with the National Sleep Foundation reporting that 40 percent of American adults report difficulty falling asleep at least a few times each month. Scullin also added that although the sample size was sufficient for the experimental, lab-based polysomnography study, further research with larger sample sizes would be beneficial. “Measures of personality, anxiety and depression might moderate the effects of writing on falling asleep, and that could be explored in an investigation with a larger sample,” he explained. “We recruited healthy young adults, and so we don’t know whether our findings would generalize to patients with insomnia, though some writing activities have previously been suggested to benefit such patients.” The findings also follow the recent trend for bullet journals, a journaling system created to help users organize their to-do lists and lives in a more mindful and creative way. Fans of bullet journals credit the method with helping to increase creativity and productivity as well as reduce stress and anxiety, which could in turn help promote a more restful night’s sleep. The findings can be found published online in the American Psychological Association’s Journal of Experimental Psychology.

Sleep: Less than 8 hours a night increases risk of depression,https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/283903/p2fb-sleep-less-8-hours-night-increases-risk-depression/,"02:05 PM January 07, 2018","Sleeping less than eight hours a night is linked to intrusive and repetitive thoughts like those seen in anxiety and depression, reports a new study. American researchers have studied the sleep duration of people with moderate to high levels of repetitive negative thinking. We already know that getting thoughts stuck in our head before we drop off can have a significant impact on sleep quality. And now a study suggests that disrupted sleep can make it more difficult to put negative thoughts aside in daily life. The researchers exposed the study’s participants to different pictures intended to trigger an emotional response. Their attention was observed through their eye movement. The researchers found that the participants who slept the least and took the longest time to fall asleep, had greater difficulty in shifting their attention away from negative information. “While other people may be able to receive negative information and move on, the participants had trouble ignoring it,” noted study author Professor Meredith Coles. These findings suggest that sleep disruption can affect the cognitive ability required to shift our attention away from negative stimuli. In the medium to long term, these obsessive negative thoughts can make us more vulnerable to various psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. The researchers intend to carry out further studies to work out how sleep cycle duration could be a contributory factor in psychological disorders. Studying sleep cycles in this way could one day help to create effective strategies for the treatment of anxiety and depression, the study suggests. The study was published in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry.
